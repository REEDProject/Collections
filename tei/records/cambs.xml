        <head>Acknowledgements</head>
        <div>
          <p>Having worked in the REED offices in Toronto as a graduate assistant for many years, I
            have had many opportunities to see and appreciate the incredible amount of dedication,
            hard work, collaboration, and expertise that goes into a REED collection. Now as an
            editor, I have the opportunity to feel gratitude for the large number of people, at REED
            and elsewhere, who help bring a collection to publication. <title>Cambridgeshire</title>
            is especially collaborative, as I inherited the collection after much of the archival
            work had been completed.</p>
          <p>First and greatest thanks, then, must go to Anne Brannen for her diligent record
            collection and transcription. Secondly, Cambridgeshire would not have been what it is if
            not for Cambridge, both town and university, and this collection certainly owes much to
            Alan H. Nelson’s <title>Cambridge</title> edition.</p>
          <p>I am also indebted to the editors both of published REED collections for those counties
            bordering Cambridgeshire (James Stokes and David Galloway) and of forthcoming
            collections, especially the REED East Anglia regional group of editors: John Craig,
            James Cummings, JoAnna Dutka, Peter Greenfield, Emily Mayne, Alan H. Nelson, and James
            Stokes. Within the REED-EA group, I also have to give special thanks to Sally-Beth
            MacLean and John Craig for their careful reviews and preliminary readings of the
            introduction, and Emily Mayne for her painstaking and invaluable editorial and
            translation work on the Italian records of John North. I also have to express my deep
            and sincere gratitude to Patrick Gregory, whose transcriptions and translations of the
            Holy Trinity guild accounts were invaluable.</p>
          <p>I must also thank all the members of the REED editorial team and research associates.
            Each has been instrumental in bringing this collection to publication, whether through
            project management; paleographical transcription, checking, and translation;
            bibliographical checking; mapping and indexing; and on-site checks. In that order, these
            include: Tanya Hagen, for her diligent support as managing editor and bibliographer;
            Patrick Gregory, for his additional Latin paleography checks, translation and
            glossaries, beyond those noted above; Peter Greenfield, for volunteering his time on
            English paleography checks; Alexandra Atiya, graduate research assistant, for her
            checking of Latin translations; Sim Ong, graduate research assistant and bibliographic
            research assistant; Byron Moldofsky, our GIS cartographer and consultant; Illya Nokhrin,
            graduate research assistant, for his work on indexing and mapping; Jenna McKellips,
            graduate research assistant, for her work on indexing; and my doctoral student and
            research assistant, Nicholas Krizanic, for his careful work identifying locations named
            in the records. I am further grateful to our research associates Stephanie Hovland, and
            Stuart Palmer for their on-site checks at The National Archives and the Cambridgeshire
            Archives, respectively, as well as Alan Nelson’s volunteer service for on-site checks at
            the British Library.</p>
          <p>More widely in the University of Toronto community, I am grateful for the exceptional
            resources available at Robarts Library, the Pontifical Institute for Mediaeval Studies
            Library, and the library of the Centre for Reformation and Renaissance Studies. At home,
            the Queen Elizabeth II Library at Memorial University of Newfoundland was similarly
            invaluable in providing access to necessary sources; I am also grateful to the
            Department of English, the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, and Memorial
            University itself for funding portions of my research.</p>
          <p>Of course my gratitude to the UK libraries and archives is great, and I thank the staff
            at The British Library, Bodleian Library, Cambridge University Library, The National
            Archives, the Cambridgeshire Record Office, and the Wisbech and Fenland Museum
            (particular thanks to the curator, Robert Bell, who went above and beyond in providing
            reproductions and document descriptions in the midst of major renovations to the
            museum). I am likewise thankful to Philip Saunders and the Cambridgeshire Record Society
            for quick and friendly delivery of some essential texts.</p>
          <p>Finally, I must thank the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada for
            the generous grant in support of REED-EA collections, with John Craig (Professor of
            History at Simon Fraser University and REED Executive Board Chair) as PI and Sally-Beth
            MacLean as co-PI (as REED General Editor and Director of Research). Special thanks are
            due to Dr Isabel Bader for her generous personal donation in support of this edition, and to the British Academy for their longstanding contribution to REED's work.</p>

        <div>
          <p>The following essay is a detailed survey of Cambridgeshire from Roman times to 1642.
            For a more focussed account of mimetic activity in the county, see <ref
              target="#traditions">'Performance Traditions.'</ref></p>

          <p>The history of Cambridgeshire, as it intersects with the history of performance, is
            largely dominated by two major centres, each deeply influential on the economic and
            religious environments of the county. These are the town of <rs ref="eats:73473"
              type="Place_PA_Settlement">Cambridge</rs>, including the collegiate <rs
              ref="eats:73450" type="Place_F_School">university</rs> and the town parishes and
            guilds, and the Isle of <rs ref="eats:322579" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Ely</rs>,
            including the bishopric, the town and its guilds, and the <rs ref="eats:324125"
              type="Place_F_School">King’s School of Ely</rs>. The authority of each radiated
            through the surrounding villages and towns, whether by providing entertainment in the
            form of the <rs ref="eats:322602" type="Collective_Office">Cambridge waits</rs> (<rs
              ref="eats:322723" type="Place_F_ReligiousHouse">Barnwell Priory</rs> and <rs
              ref="eats:326134" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Bassingbourn</rs>), offering performance
            space (as Pembroke Hall did for <rs ref="eats:314306" type="Place_PA_Settlement"
              >Linton</rs>), or prosecuting illicit performance activities (chiefly <rs
              ref="eats:79074" type="Entertainment_FolkCustom">Morris</rs>
            <rs ref="eats:18451" type="Entertainer_Type">dancing</rs>, but also other forms of <rs
              ref="eats:45652" type="CrimesMisdemeanors">profaning</rs> the Sabbath, and an instance
            of <rs ref="eats:45484" type="CrimesMisdemeanors">cross-dressing</rs>) through the Ely
            diocesan courts. The history of the town of Cambridge and of performance in the town and
            the university, respectively, have already been fully discussed by Alan H. Nelson in
            REED’s <title>Cambridge</title> collection. However, as Nelson notes, connections
            between the colleges of Cambridge and the bishopric of Ely are numerous: the chancellor
            of the university was a ‘representative of the bishop of Ely,’ and <rs ref="eats:313886"
              type="Person_Clergy">Humphrey Tyndall</rs> (1549–1614), dean of Ely, was a fellow of
            Pembroke Hall, and subsequently master of Queens’ College and a vice-chancellor of the
              university.<note type="foot">Nelson, <title>Cambridge</title>, vol 2, p 780; ‘Humphrey

            Stanford E. Lehmberg notes, following the Reformation the 'ties between Cambridge and
            Ely were particularly close':</p>

          <p>'[O]ne finds among the prebendaries of Ely such men as Richard Wilkes and Edward
            Barwell, masters of Christ’s College; Henry Hervey, master of Trinity Hall and
            vice-chancellor in 1560; Giles Eyre, fellow and vice-provost of King’s; John Fuller,
            Edward Gascoyne, and John Duport, masters of Jesus; Thomas Bacon, master of Gonville
            Hall; Thomas Peacock, master of Queens’; and Edward Leeds, master of Clare.'<note

          <p>Further, Pembroke Hall leased land to the town of Linton for its guildhall (later known
            as <rs ref="eats:314340" type="Place_F_GuildHall">the Townhouse</rs>) through the
            fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.<note type="foot"><title>VCH: Cambridgeshire</title>,

            <p>Cambridgeshire, often considered part of East Anglia, is bordered by Norfolk to the
              northeast, Suffolk to the east, Essex and Hertfordshire to the south, Northamptonshire
              to the west, and Lincolnshire to the north. Famously low-lying, the county comprises
              several geographic divisions based on the composition of the soil and the elevation of
              the areas: the best known of these are perhaps the fenlands of the north, partially
              flooded fields of peat or silt which are interrupted by elevations of clay (as with
              Ely, March, and Chatteris) or chalky silt (as with Wisbech). Chalk escarpments form
              the so-called ‘uplands’ of the south, clay hills form the west and southeast, and
              chalkland lies between these hills, spanning the county from the southwest to the
                northeast.<note type="foot">Galloway, <title>History of Cambridgeshire</title>, p
                13.</note> The main river of the county is the River Cam (originally named the
              Granta, but renamed the Cam through a back-formation from the town of Cambridge).<note

              (beginning in Ashwell, Hertfordshire) and the Granta (beginning outside of Widdington,
              Essex), and the Cam flows into the Great Ouse, south of Ely. The Ouse itself then
              connects to the North Sea at King’s Lynn, Norfolk. The rivers, along with chalkland
              strips, were the major sites for settlement from the period of Roman occupation
              forward, and the construction of important roads of medieval and early modern
              Cambridgeshire.</p>

              Cambridgeshire held or was bordered by the Wensum, Welland, Nene, Cam, and Great and

              county is situated along several of the major medieval roads first constructed by the
              Romans. During three and a half centuries of occupation of Cambridgeshire between 43
              and 410 CE, the Romans constructed both the commercially significant Icknield Way,
              which ran from Norfolk to Wiltshire/Dorset, and the military route Ermine Street,
              which ran from London to Lincoln and York. These two highways intersected at <rs

              Cambridgeshire underwent a period of disputed control through the seventh century,
              with the kingdom of East Anglia holding Norfolk, Suffolk, and the eastern fens, the
              East Saxons holding the south of the county, and Middle Anglia possessing the west of
              Cambridgeshire and the East Midlands until Mercia conquered the province by 700
                CE.<note type="foot">Galloway, <title>History of Cambridgeshire</title>, p

              as Bruce Galloway notes, the fenlands in particular featured primarily monastic

            <p>Between 866 and 1066 Cambridgeshire along with the rest of East Anglia came under
              repeated Viking incursion. Cambridge itself was taken in 875 and the county became
              part of the Danelaw. Following successful English attempts by Edward the Elder to
              retake Cambridgeshire in 905 and the rest of East Anglia in 921, the county again fell
              to the Danish in 1010. However, despite these two centuries of control, ‘the
              archaeological record emphasises rather the continuity of English occupation,’ and
              indeed only Toft and Bourne have Danish place-names.<note type="foot">Galloway,
                  <title>History of Cambridgeshire</title>, p 35.</note> Meanwhile English authority
              over the abbeys persisted. During the reign of King Edgar, 959–75, the Abbey of
              Peterborough was restored, further monasteries were founded at Ramsey and Chatteris,
              and charters of endowment granted to the two hundreds of the fenlands (Downham and
              Littleport), and to the monastery at Ely in 970.<note type="foot">VCH:

              Conquest. The replacement of the English abbot of Peterborough, Brand, by the Norman

              ‘underlying resentment of foreign invaders’ and ‘the imposition of a manorial
              economy,’ although it was crushed within two years by King William — who personally
              supervised the siege from Cambridge — and ended with William’s threat to confiscate
              manorial estates from the abbot of Ely.<note type="foot">Galloway, <title>History of
                  Cambridgeshire</title>, pp 36–7.</note> Further, the rebellion marks the
              development of these two centres of influence, Cambridge and Ely, as locations defined
              respectively by secular and economic, and religious authority. These centres were
              intertwined, with Cambridge-educated clerics acquiring ecclesiastical positions in
              Ely, or teaching as schoolmasters in parishes, and various monasteries dependent on
              Ely Priory constructed across the county.</p>

            <p>The first half of the fourteenth century marked a continued growth in population and
              prosperity. The fenlands were further drained and cultivated: this was the case
              particularly for the silt fens, which unlike the lower-lying peat fens were able to be
              drained more easily, and were not subject to backing up by the fen rivers. While the
              silt fens listed in Domesday illustrate a lightly populated area (two families per
              1,000 acres), the Lay Subsidy of 1327 reveals that ‘the siltlands had passed south
              Cambridgeshire in population density and intensive farming.’<note type="foot"

              was predominantly pastoral and the towns of Leverington and Tydd St Giles grew
              markedly: Leverington, to protect fields from the high tides of the late thirteenth
              century, constructed the so-called ‘Roman Bank,’ a fifteen-foot high sea wall equipped
              with culverts to ensure further drainage.<note type="foot">Galloway, <title>History of
                  Cambridgeshire</title>, p 43.</note> During the same period, the marshlands, home
              to the villages of Doddington, Littleport, and Stuntney, focused on fishing (mainly
              eels) for the abbot-bishop of Ely.<note type="foot">Galloway, <title>History of
                  Cambridgeshire</title>, p 43.</note> Finally, in the uplands of southern
              Cambridgeshire, the forests were cleared for cultivation and villages there doubled or
              trebled in size.<note type="foot">Galloway, <title>History of Cambridgeshire</title>,
                p 45.</note> The increased production gave rise both to smaller market towns like
              Linton and Kingston and to river ports such as Swavesey, Soham, Reach, Burwell, and
              Swaffham Bulbeck, as well as larger outports, including Ely, Wisbech, and King’s Lynn
              in Norfolk. Town charters were issued for Cambridge in 1120–31 and a charter for the
              town’s Merchant’s Guild confirmed in 1201, the same year in which the Rogation Fair
              was granted.<note type="foot">B&#228;rbel Brodt, 'East Anglia,' <title>The Cambridge

              fairs at Wisbech and Barnwell Priory and large fairs like the Rogation Monday fair in

            <p>The fourteenth century, however, also marked an end to this growth. As R.H. Britnell
              observes, 'water encroached on cultivated lands,' a result of both natural and
              anthropogenic factors, including rising sea levels and 'the relaxation of
              responsibility on the part of landlords and local communities' in maintaining sea
                defenses.<note type="foot">R.H. Britnell, 'Eastern England,' <title>The Agrarian

                (Cambridge, 1991), 54.</note> When the cumulative pressure of successive crises —
              the end of the Medieval Warm Period, the Great Famine, and the Black Death — was
              finally felt, about one-third of the population of the county had been lost, and would
              only stabilize by 1380. Even the 1342 ‘Nonarum Inquisitiones,’ detailing the war taxes
              paid by each parish, marks the beginning of this decline. The clayland villages in the
              southeast reported up to half their fields left to waste, Bassingbourn lost 400 acres,
              and the once prosperous fenland villages of Newton and Tydd St Giles lost 1000 acres
              to flooding.<note type="foot">Galloway, <title>History of Cambridgeshire</title>, pp
                60.</note> As elsewhere in England, the changes in Cambridgeshire were most often
              marked by a breakdown in the manorial systems of the past, although Cambridgeshire's
              settlements, like those of Suffolk, Essex, and (to a degree) Norfolk had 'no
              example[s] of [village] desertion ... attributable to the Black Death.'<note
                type="foot">Britnell, 'Eastern England,' p 55.</note> Further, discontent with
              ecclesiastical wealth grew, and church officials reported that religious houses were
              falling into ‘dereliction and sin,’ with Ely Cathedral indebted and unable to repair
              the roof, and the prioress of Chatteris hoarding money, perhaps in reaction to these
              economic conditions.<note type="foot">Galloway, <title>History of
                  Cambridgeshire</title>, p 63.</note></p>

            <p>The fifteenth and sixteenth centuries were subsequently defined by a consolidation
              and reorganization of the agricultural landscape, a situation further complicated in
              the latter century by the Reformation and the Dissolution of the monasteries. Natural
              disasters still affected the county: floods along the Nene River in 1439, for example,
              'drowned over 10000 acres in Wisbech, Leverington, Newton, and Tydd St. Giles.'<note
                type="foot">Britnell, 'Eastern England,' p 54.</note> This is not to say that
              recreational and performance activities in the county ceased: the records show a
              continuous tradition of such entertainment. The churchwardens’ accounts of
              Bassingbourn, for example, record regular church <rs ref="eats:40561"
                type="Entertainment_Type">ales</rs>, church repairs, and endowments from 1497 to
              1538, as well as the well-supported St George’s Play on 20 July 1511 (see the <ref

                >Sts Peter and Paul Churchwardens' Accounts</ref>). Similarly, the Holy Trinity
              guild accounts of Leverington report regular guild dinners and payments to minstrels
              through the fifteenth century (see the <ref

                >records</ref> pertaining to the guild of the Holy Trinity). A new pattern of growth
              did not fully emerge in Cambridgeshire, however, until the late fifteenth and early
              sixteenth centuries, when the county began to show the effects of reorganization.
              Renewed prosperity led to a building campaign of ‘imposing domestic architecture,’
              including constructions at Anglesey Abbey, Madingley, <rs ref="eats:322453"

            <p>Early seventeenth century Cambridgeshire seemed to be little affected by the Stuart
              dynasty. The reign of <rs ref="eats:24537" type="Person_Royalty">Charles I</rs>,
              however, saw the king’s conflict with the now firmly Puritan university, led by
              Matthew Wren, who insisted on adherence to the prayer book revisions designated by
              Archbishop <rs ref="eats:51692" type="Person_Male">Laud</rs>, as documented in the

            <p>Medieval Cambridgeshire, as Miri Rubin describes it, ‘was an area of comparatively
              dense and old settlement, where the pressure of population growth was acutely felt in
              the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.’<note type="foot">Miri Rubin, <title>Charity and
                  Community in Medieval Cambridge</title> (Cambridge, 1987), 33–4.</note> For the
              time span that the records cover, however, Cambridgeshire was marked by a period that
              was ‘transitional not only for the university, but the county ... in which ‘medieval’
              patterns of life and agriculture were broken, and replaced by new customs, in which
              the role of the church changed dramatically.’<note type="foot">Galloway,
                  <title>History of Cambridgeshire</title>, p 60.</note></p>

            <p>Following the great economic growth of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, which
              gave rise to market towns as well as the regular large fairs discussed above, the
              fourteenth century marked an end to the prosperity of the county. The records of the
              St Ives Fair from 1270 to 1324 boasted not only a large contingent of local sellers
              less than ten miles away (201 people), but also 311 vendors 'from more distant places,
              mainly the townsmen of Boston, Bury St Edmunds, Cambridge, Ely, King’s Lynn,
              Leicester, Lincoln, London, Northhampton, and Stamford, as well as aliens from
              Flanders, France, and even Italy.'<note type="foot">David L. Farmer, 'Marketing the

              During roughly the same time period, however, the gross income of the fair court
              declined considerably: from a high of &#163;27 18s 2d in 1254 to &#163;2 12s 5d in
              1324, and the number of far-flung fairgoers similarly decreased.<note type="foot"

              fallow land became fertile again and was more readily available, ‘fewer people

                  <title>Charity and Community</title>, p 22.</note> While this demographic and
              economic situation did mean that ‘sons of peasant families had favourable chances of
              acquiring holdings and continuing the traditional way of life,’ as Rubin notes, ‘lands
              tended to go to those who were already substantial owners and influential members of
              the village community.’<note type="foot">Rubin, <title>Charity and Community</title>,
                p 24.</note> Some institutions, such as Barnwell Priory, sold estates to local

                >Haslingfield</rs>), while new manor houses were also constructed; among these,

                records.<note type="foot">Galloway, <title>History of Cambridgeshire</title>, p
                66.</note> Even so, Cambridgeshire is significant primarily in its general dearth of
              aristocratic families.</p>

            <p>Overall, the period dating from the disasters of the fourteenth century led to a
              general improvement in the standard of living for the villages of the county, and
              corporate bodies such as religious houses were able to increase their holdings
              substantially. This new economic growth was nonetheless focused on the towns, and
              especially Cambridge, which remained ‘one of the most important centres for marketing
              of agricultural surplus in East Anglia.’<note type="foot">Rubin, <title>Charity and
                  Community</title>, pp 34–5.</note></p>

            <p>The increased holdings by religious houses meant that the Dissolution of the
              monasteries had a profound effect on the economic as well as the religious life of the
              county, as the monasteries’ possessions passed into the hands of the bishops,
              colleges, and the laity, resulting in a further concentration of wealth in fewer
                hands.<note type="foot">Galloway, <title>History of Cambridgeshire</title>, p

              persisted through this process, and the King’s School at Ely was founded in 1541 from

            <p>The demographic history of Cambridgeshire mirrors that of many other counties in
              displaying a highly fluctuating population, which may have doubled between 1066 and
              1300, and stabilized again by 1380 and after.<note type="foot">Galloway,
                  <title>History of Cambridgeshire</title>, pp 45, 61.</note> According to Josiah
              Cox Russell, the county had a population of 20,058 in 1086, perhaps 55,160 in 1279,

                (11 October 2011), 26.</note> This pattern of growth and contraction through the
              period can be attributed to the crises of the fourteenth century: the population
              generally increased steadily between 1086 and the early fourteenth century, rapidly
              increased in the first half of the 1300s, faced a sharp decline following the plague,
              and then increased again until the 1600s.</p>

            <p>The topographical differences within the county meant the population was highly
              variable according to region. Margaret Spufford notes that medieval Cambridgeshire
              'has suffered' in many population studies in that 'it has frequently been treated
              together with the Isle of Ely,’ meaning that ‘the densely settled county and the
              sparsely settled fens of the Isle are usually lumped together.’<note type="foot"
                >Spufford, <title>Contrasting Communities</title>, p 3.</note> Thus, although
              ‘Cambridgeshire was among the most densely settled areas in the south-east ... [l]arge
              parts of the Isle, on the other hand, might well still have been recognised in the
              sixteenth century, before the great fen-drainage schemes of the next hundred years, by
              St Guthlac, who had sought complete and utter solitude there in the eighth
                century.’<note type="foot">Spufford, <title>Contrasting Communities</title>, p 4.

            <p>Focusing on individual manors, towns, and parishes offers evidence of such variation.
              Kirtling, lying on the border with Suffolk, and the home of the <rs ref="eats:333088"
                type="Person_Family">North</rs> family from 1533 onward, stands as an example of
              this population volatility. One of the most densely populated parishes in the area,
              Kirtling had fifty-three tenants in 1086, fifty-four in 1327, and 186 in 1377; tenant
              lists from the 1430s indicate that the population had declined, and the parish had
              about 240 inhabitants in 1603.<note type="foot"><title>VCH: Cambridgeshire</title>,

              parishes featured in the records – Bassingbourn, Leverington, Linton, and Wisbech –
              seem to have avoided these declines. Bassingbourn, one of the most populous parishes
              in the county, had about 180 inhabitants in 1347, 347 taxpayers in 1377, and perhaps

            <p> Cambridgeshire had, from the early Middle Ages, an important role to play in the
              religious history of England. The large number of religious houses, the prominence of
              Ely, and the role of the university in producing trained clergy for both smaller
              parishes and major dioceses, created a vibrant religious landscape before, during, and

            <p>The kingdom of Middle Anglia, East Anglia, and the land that is now Cambridgeshire
              underwent a gradual conversion in the mid-seventh century, as described by Bede. While
              Bede reports that the kingdom of East Anglia converted under Sigbert circa 631, the
              kingdom of Mercia was said not to have converted until 653 under King Peada.<note

              then pursued a hermetic life on the island of Croyland (now Crowland, Lincolnshire) in

              built at Peterborough (<hi rend="italic">c</hi> 655), Ely (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>
              673), and Thorney (bef. 972). Ely was made a bishopric in 1109, giving the
              abbot-bishop full authority over the new diocese and the county its ecclesiastical
              centre. After this point monastic houses flourished and the birth of the university at
              Cambridge in 1209 ensured a new source of educated clergy for the parish churches. By
              the early sixteenth century, however, and at the eve of the Reformation, many clergy
              in Cambridgeshire ‘were pluralists, absentee, or both’: Galloway notes that many
              clerical wills show ‘a marked absence of books, especially bibles’ and that many
              priests were ordained despite a lack of Latin or knowledge of holy scripture.<note

            <head>The Reformation in Cambridgeshire</head>

            <p>Some of the most profound effects of the Reformation in the county sprang from the
              Dissolution. Since Ely, Barnwell, Chatteris, and other religious houses held dozens of
              manors and church benefices, the seizure of their property and transfer to the
              bishops, colleges, and laity transformed the economic landscape. At the same time, the
              effects of the Reformation extended far beyond the Dissolution, affecting religious
              practices throughout the county, from the economic and religious centres of Cambridge
              and Ely to the smaller towns and parishes that appear in the records. Cambridgeshire,
              unlike other East Anglian counties such as Norfolk and Suffolk, lacks a
              county-specific history of the Reformation: as such, anecdotal examples must be drawn
              from more granular studies.<note type="foot">See, respectively, A. Hassell Smith,

            <p>Arguably, the Reformation in Cambridgeshire was defined and guided by the university:
              as Nelson notes, Cambridge was indeed a ‘breeding ground of the English
                Reformation.’<note type="foot">Nelson, <title>Cambridgeshire</title>, vol 2, p
                708.</note> Winthrop Hudson observes that 'the new religious ferment associated with
              the Protestant Reformation was even more important in quickening the intellectual
              excitement at Cambridge in the 1520s,' transforming the university into 'an early
              center of Protestant influence in England.'<note type="foot">Winthrop Hudson,

              Nicholas West of Ely fought against Latimer and other Cambridge heterodoxies, his
              successor Thomas Goodrich engaged in ‘determined efforts to Protestantise the diocesan

              figures prominent in the records, including Thomas Thirlby and Richard Cox, whose
              synod (<ptr target="#cambs-ridp257933224"/>) and injunctions (<ptr
                target="#cambs-ridp257976008"/>) from 1558 and 1579, respectively, reveal this
              dedication to Protestant doctrine, as do the preponderance of records from the
              diocesan courts. Upon Goodrich’s entry into the royal council, arch-Protestantism
              defined the ecclesiastical, episcopal, and scholarly milieus.</p>

            <p>This ferment was not long to last: by 1531, the group that participated in
              '[a]nimated debates at the White Horse Tavern (‘little Germany,’ they called it) ...
              had lost whatever coherence it may have had.'<note type="foot">Hudson,
                  <title>Cambridge Connection</title>, p 48.</note> Further, <rs ref="eats:43849"
                type="Person_Female">Mary</rs>’s accession to the throne in 1553 led to a short but
              bloody interlude in reform, during which time all but three masters of the college
              were expelled, Goodrich was dispossessed, village clergy were purged, and only
              Catholics were permitted to take degrees. This did not, however, necessarily result in
              an exile of Protestantism, as Hudson notes:</p>

            <p>'While some members of what is called the Cambridge connection did go into exile,
              others did not. Some simply withdrew from public life, some were able to make an
              accommodation which enabled them to function in minor official capacities during
              Mary’s reign, some were not put to the test, and some went into hiding or made
              themselves as inconspicuous as possible. The response to the Marian regime varied
              according to differences in temperament, in the intensity and character of religious
              convictions, and in the individual’s perception of the danger of arrest.'<note
                type="foot">Hudson, <title>Cambridge Connection</title>, p 5.</note></p>

            <p>Thus in the reign of <rs ref="eats:11772" type="Person_Royalty">Elizabeth</rs> the
              university began again 'to supply the rank and file of a new and larger puritan party,
              young men who were already accustomed to setting themselves against ecclesiastical and
              academic authority.'<note type="foot">Patrick Collinson, <title>The Elizabethan
                  Puritan Movement</title> (Oxford, 1990), 122.</note> Those educated at Cambridge
              came from all corners of England, producing what Patrick Collinson describes as
              '[c]lerical puritanism, as a cohesive, national movement'; it was here at the
              university 'that the various regional and social origins of the Elizabethan preachers
              were submerged in a common brotherhood.'<note type="foot">Collinson,

                Collinson, chapter 3, 'The Universities and the New Men,' pp 122–130.</note></p>

            <p>The university itself then remained sympathetic to Puritan ideology and the later
              sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries saw an increase in the disciplinary powers
              of the vice-chancellor over moral infractions.<note type="foot">Galloway,
                  <title>History of Cambridgeshire</title>, pp 58–9.</note> Some evidence for the
              same may be found at Ely, 'in the contribution of &#163;5 sent in 1590 by the Dean and
              Chapter of Ely to the city of Geneva, presumably a token of appreciation for spiritual
              leadership given at a time of need.'<note type="foot">Lehmberg, <title>Reformation of
                  Cathedrals</title>, p 163.</note> It may be in reaction to this Protestant zeal
              that, as Nelson notes, ‘[t]he town’s protestantism ... did not generally embrace
              radical puritan strictures against worldly pleasures, nor did the local population
              give up its desire for secular entertainment,' particularly during the reign of
                Elizabeth.<note type="foot">Nelson, <title>Cambridgeshire</title>, vol 2, p

              the King’s School at Ely, for example, show a careful balancing act between supporting
              public performance but condemning the sometimes resultant disorder (see <ptr
                target="#cambs-ridp288473096"/>). Additionally, as Collinson discusses, '[n]ot all
              of these hundreds of Cambridge preachers were to become militant Presbyterians':</p>

            <p>'[T]he typical Cambridge puritan was no extremist: practical godliness concerned him
              more than platforms of church government. To know the situations in which most of
              these clergymen found themselves is to understand the dominant motif in most of their
              ministries. They were essentially pastors, faced with blank irreligion and ignorance
              in the souls under their care. They preached primary protestant doctrine, "spiritual"
              and "plain," rarely having occasion to touch on controversial matters, and the best of
              them became even more famous as physicians of the soul than as preachers. As Thomas
              Fuller wrote of Richard Greenham, the model puritan of Dry Drayton, "his masterpiece
              was in comforting wounded consciences".'<note type="foot">Collinson,
                  <title>Elizabethan Puritan Movement</title>, p 128.</note></p>

            <p>While the university and the bishops of Ely may have set the tone for the Reformation
              in Cambridgeshire, other similarly principled groups or individuals were at times in
              opposition to these institutions, such as the Family of Love and the clergyman of Dry
              Drayton, Richard Greenham (<hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1540s–94). Even such cases,
              however, show some connections to Ely or the university.</p>

            <p>The Family of Love (<hi rend="italic">Familia Caritatis</hi>) was a sixteenth-century
              religious movement based on the teachings of the Dutch mystic Hendrick Niclaes. The
              English Familists comprised a rather broad cross-section of society, despite
              contemporary and modern critiques that they were ‘largely uneducated peasants’ who
              ‘lacked the support of those indigenous merchants and scholars, those prosperous and
              powerful burghers, who made it a movement of importance on the Continent.’<note
                type="foot">Christopher W. Marsh, <title>The Family of Love in English Society,
                  1550–1630</title> (Cambridge, 1994), 5, citing Jean Dietz Moss, <title>‘Godded
                  with God’: Hendrick Niclaes and his Family of Love</title> (Philadelphia, 1981),
                22; Alastair Hamilton, <title>The Family of Love</title> (Cambridge, 1981),
                132.</note> Building on two distinct traditions – one anti-intellectual and
              spiritual, the other sectarian and Messianic – in England the Familists ‘combined with
              ... heterodox creeds already in existence,’ including Lollardy and English
                Anabaptism.<note type="foot">Hamilton, <title>The Family of Love</title>, pp 114–16,
                132–3.</note> The Familists believed in an inward spiritual transformation that
              would permit ‘the godly individual ... to become, ultimately, one of the mysterious
                “elders”.’<note type="foot">Marsh, <title>Family of Love</title>, p 20.</note> Such
              a transformation would permit a mutual incorporation of God and human, requiring a
              forsaking of all past knowledge and a deep reflection on one’s own sin. In the English
              context, Niclaes’ soteriology was especially suspect: ‘Christ was to be imitated in
              all that he had gone through — crucifixion, death, burial, <hi rend="italic"
                >resurrection</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ascension</hi>.’<note type="foot">Marsh,
                  <title>Family of Love</title>, p 24.</note> This form of <hi rend="italic"
                >imitatio Christi</hi>, Marsh notes, had precedent in English religious belief, and
              specifically in the context of Cambridgeshire. Marsh cites in particular Walter
              Hilton’s <title>The Scale of Perfection</title>, and notes that Hilton ‘had worked as
              a consistory court lawyer in the diocese of Ely between 1371 and 1384, while in the
              service of Bishop <rs ref="eats:325345" type="Person_Clergy">Thomas
                Arundel</rs>.'<note type="foot">Marsh, <title>Family of Love</title>, p 32.</note>
              Whether anything more than a tenuous argument can be made on this connection, Marsh
              notes that over thirty Familists held offices in the diocese of Ely between 1560 and
              1615, that Familists were present in the court of Elizabeth I, and that several
              English Familist groups were resident in the county, most notably in Balsham,
              Horingsea and Wisbech.<note type="foot">Marsh, <title>Family of Love</title>, pp
                170–2.</note></p>

            <p>The Familists faced considerable critique from the religious establishment: in 1580
              Bishop Cox sought examination of ‘seventy supposed adherents of the Family ... by a
              Commission which included Richard Greenham, and fifteen men and women were imprisoned
              as members.’<note type="foot">Spufford, <title>Contrasting Communities</title>, p 256,
                citing Gonville and Caius College, MS 53/30, ff 72v–73, 126v–129.</note>
              Nonetheless, for all the critiques offered against them, the Familists' continued
              prominence was likely due neither to the ‘ignorance of wider society’ nor to
              ‘religious apathy.’ Instead, Marsh argues, it is possible ‘that early modern English
              society — despite its martyrs and its exiles — possessed considerable resources of
              religious tolerance,’ producing an atmosphere ‘in which tensions implicit in the local
              situation were generally managed and controlled without recourse to the courts or
              higher authority.’<note type="foot">Marsh, <title>Family of Love</title>, p
                250.</note></p>

            <p>One of the major figures that sought to return the Family to conformity was Richard
              Greenham (early 1540s–94), who matriculated at Pembroke College (MA, 1567) and was a
              fellow thereafter.<note type="foot">Kenneth L. Parker and Eric J. Carlson,

              A Puritan lauded for his ‘practical divinity,’ Greenham was, as Kenneth L. Parker and
              Eric J. Carlson describe:</p>

            <p>'[A] pastor, intensely loyal to the Church of England, and obsessed with the
              realization of a visible godly community in every English parish. Greenham’s practical
              divinity defies our categories of "Anglican" /"conformist" and "puritan"
              /"nonconformist", and points to a broader category of clergy too concerned with
              establishing "true religion" and fighting popery in the parish to tolerate an
              overscrupulosity that detracted from the work of Protestant evangelization.'<note
                type="foot">Parker and Carlson, <title>Practical Divinity</title>, p 8.</note></p>

            <p>Dry Drayton, the location of Crowland Abbey, was a village of moderate size,
              numbering thirty-one households in 1563, but with a perhaps sizable population growth
              in the next two decades.<note type="foot">Parker and Carlson, <title>Practical
                  Divinity</title>, pp 14–15.</note> The manor of Dry Drayton passed to Thomas
              Hutton after the Dissolution; his heir John offered the parish to Greenham to minister
              in 1570, after two rectors of short-lived tenure who were dismissed in turn for
              non-residency and <rs ref="eats:45689" type="CrimesMisdemeanors">adultery</rs>.<note
                type="foot">Parker and Carlson, <title>Practical Divinity</title>, pp 11, 14.</note>
              It seemed at first that Greenham, too, was not long for the position. In 1571 he
              refused to sign a statement in support of the <rs ref="eats:328770"
                type="Thing_BookPlayMusic">prayer book</rs>, the Articles of Religion, and clerical
              vestments; two years later, he did not seek the consent of the bishop and two justices
              of the peace before marrying Katherine Bownd.<note type="foot">Parker and Carlson,
                  <title>Practical Divinity</title>, pp 15–16.</note> After these two instances of
              non-conformity, Greenham faced suspension and wrote an apologia, ‘The Apologie or
              aunswere of Maister Grenham, Minister of Dreaton, unto the Bishop of Ely, being
              commaunded to subscribe, and to use the Romish habite, with allowance of the
              com[munion] booke,’ in which he claimed right of conscience and criticized the tumult
              over external matters such as these as a sign of the Devil’s work.<note type="foot"
                >Parker and Carlson, <title>Practical Divinity</title>, p 16. The 'Bishop of Ely'
                was Richard Cox.</note> Cox elected to retain Greenham in the position and recruited
              him to hold conferences with recusants and Familists. On the latter group, ‘Greenham
              played a central role in the diocesan campaign against the Family of Love in the same
              year, devising the articles to which suspects would subscribe and, through personal
              conversation, returning some of the tractable to “orthodoxy”.’<note type="foot">Parker
                and Carlson, <title>Practical Divinity</title>, p 18. See also Spufford,
                  <title>Contrasting Communities</title>, pp 256–7.</note> Greenham’s approach to
              these matters was complex. He argued that ‘[c]ommon people were drawn to [heresies]
              because their parish churches failed to offer the sort of teaching and preaching
              necessary to meet their spiritual needs’ and sought to remedy this concern by
              establishing a household seminary in Dry Drayton that focused on practical training
              for ministry, an intermediary step between university training and the ministry
                itself.<note type="foot">Parker and Carlson, <title>Practical Divinity</title>, p
                18.</note> Greenham seems to have applied this practical approach to ministry in Dry
              Drayton himself, preaching not only in church but also in the fields of the village,
              urging confession during Mass, introducing mid-week catechism sessions, and
              administering charity to the poor. As a result Dry Drayton was a place of intense
              religious ferment. Already notorious before Greenham’s time ‘for its connections with
              advanced reformers and prominent London religious radicals,’ the parish sponsored one
              of the London lectureships known for nonconformists; under Greenham, the number of
              lectureships rose to four.<note type="foot">Parker and Carlson, <title>Practical

              there was no question in these men's minds that they wanted a total abolition of
              episcopal and traditional church government.... The Cambridgeshire laity, in some
              villages, were already convinced by 1640 that they wanted a total reform in church
              government; and their radical ideas were not planted in their heads by the dissenting
              evangelists Denne, Parnell and Holcroft, or even by the other clergy, who, with
              Holcroft, failed to subscribe in 1662.'<note type="foot">Spufford, <title>Contrasting

            <p><rs ref="eats:322723" type="Place_F_ReligiousHouse">Barnwell Priory</rs> was one of
              the earliest Augustinian foundations in England, established by Picot, lord of Bourn
              and Madingley, in 1092 at a new church dedicated to St Giles in Cambridge. After St
              Giles came into the hands of the king, following a rebellion by Picot’s son Robert,
              the priory then passed to Pain Peverel (<hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1060–1132), who
              granted it lands on the eastern edge of Cambridge and commenced construction of a new
              church. Subsequent donations by the townspeople permitted the priory to build up its
              demesne around Barnwell Field, giving Barnwell its name. During the twelfth and
              thirteenth centuries Barnwell continued to grow in size, particularly under the ninth
              prior, Laurence de Stanesfeld (d. 1251), who saw the construction of a refectory,
              guest hall, infirmary, granary, stables, bakehouse, and brewhouse, gatehouse, and
              inner gate of the inclosure. In 1352 Barnwell sold lands to the Corpus Christi and St
              Mary’s Guilds to found their college in the university, and the priory remained
              closely affiliated with the university and colleges after this date, raising money for
              students’ maintenance and hostelling Augustinian students who had no dedicated
              college. Barnwell was also a regular lodging house for royalty and the bishops of Ely,
              though the former honour was taken on by the colleges in the fifteenth century. For
              much of its history Barnwell comprised seventeen canons, but here as elsewhere the
              number dwindled in the fifteenth century, with only twelve in 1455, seven in 1474,
              fourteen by 1489, and nine in 1507. At the time of the Dissolution there were ten
              canons and five novices as well as sixteen or seventeen secular servants.<note

              the house by Richard de Clare (<hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1153–1217), third earl of

              Mary’s on the site was established as a religious house is a deed naming the first
              prior of Anglesey, Richard, in 1222. The priory fell under direct control of the
              bishop of Ely as soon as 1237, when Bishop Hugh Northwold (d. 1254) directed the then
              prior, William de Fordham, never to raise loans or incur debts of more than sixty
              marks without advice from the bishop. As with Barnwell, Anglesey continued to grow
              through small endowments, donations, and purchases from this point until about 1389.
              By the time of the clerical poll-tax of 1379, Anglesey had seven canons resident,
              including the prior, a number which seems to have held steady through the fifteenth
              century. At the eve of the Dissolution that number increased to nine canons and the
              priory was surrendered to the crown before 7 August 1536.<note type="foot"><title>VCH:

            <p><rs ref="eats:322579" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Ely</rs> lies about sixteen miles
              northeast of Cambridge, on the western bank of the Ouse. The high ground for the
              settlement is what established its ‘isle’ name in the early Middle Ages and perhaps
              controlled its growth: the town is not much larger than one square mile in size. A
              castle built by William I once stood in Ely, on Cherry (or Mill) Hill on the southwest
              of the cathedral park; by the mid-thirteenth century, however, neither the castle nor
              any successive structure was still standing and the <rs ref="eats:322628"
                type="Place_F_Church">cathedral</rs> dominated the site. It was the ecclesiastical
              authorities who coordinated construction of the roads, bridges, and drainage of the
              city, as well as the education of children of the town citizens.<note type="foot"

            <p>Historically, Ely was a site of major political activity in the county: Hereward fled
              to Ely in the eleventh century, the castle was taken and destroyed by Prince Edward in
              1268 during the baronial struggles of the thirteenth century, and the Revolt of 1381
              led to attacks on the bishop’s prison and the execution of the justice Sir Edmund
              Walsyngham. These moments of unrest, however, were followed by several centuries of
              relative peace and development; by 1416, the city had almost achieved its present
                layout.<note type="foot"><title>VCH: Cambridgeshire</title>, vol 2, pp 199–210,

              seems to have predominated over industry in the comparatively small city, and its
              general prosperity made Ely an ideal centre for religious guilds. From 1389 these
              included the guilds of the Assumption, All Saints, and St John the Baptist (at the
              church of St Mary), All Saints, Corpus Christi, and St John the Baptist (at the church
              of St Peter), and finally, Holy Trinity, Holy Cross, St Peter, St Ethelreada, and St
              Katherine (at the church of the Holy Trinity). The guild of St Anne appears by 1458
              and the guilds of St Withburga and St Sexburga are mentioned in 1516–17.<note

            <head>Bassingbourn</head>

            <p>The parish of <rs ref="eats:326134" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Bassingbourn</rs> lies
              in the southwest of Cambridgeshire and about twelve miles southwest of the town of
              Cambridge. It was bordered by two of the major highways of medieval and early modern
              England: on the east by Ermine Street, which ran from London to Lincoln, and on the
              south by Icknield Way, which ran from Norfolk to Wiltshire/Dorset. To the north
              Bassingbourn was bordered by the River Cam (or Rhee) and to the northwest by Abington
              Pigotts. Bassingbourn was the site of several major manor houses: Richmonds, Castle,
              and Seymours. Richmonds, granted to Count Alan, lord of Richmond, in 1086, remained
              until the 1500s; from 1280 it was the site of a manor house to the northwest of the
              churchyard but this was ruined by 1436. Among other manor houses stood the so-called
              ‘castle,’ which lay about half a mile north of the village and has incorrectly been
              named a residence of <rs ref="eats:13153" type="Person_Male">John of Gaunt</rs>, but
              which in fact was likely constructed by John Bassingbourn, son of Sir Warin
              Bassingbourn, in 1378. The castle thence passed, in order, to the Tiptofts, the
              Ingoldisthorpes, and the Lynnes in 1487. The Lynnes also had acquired, by 1589, the
              Seymours manor house; John Lynne, the owner at that time, was found to be overbearing
              and litigious in his expansion of his estates, serving as an example of the shifts in
              land ownership described above (‘Wealth and Town Economies’). Within the village, the
              majority of arable land was divided into smaller furlongs, though the ‘Great field’
              which lay mostly south of Ashwell Street was about eighty acres in size and common
              pastures were scattered through the area, offering space for sheep (perhaps 1100 in
              1347). Perhaps because of its position along the major roads, Bassingbourn had an inn
              by 1485. The village also had a resident schoolmaster from the late 1570s to the
              1630s. From the sixteenth century forward, the time period covered by the records,
              there was a small group of prosperous yeomen, including the Lynnes, Bolnests, Warrens,
              Curtises, Archers, and Turpins.</p>

            <p>In this time period Bassingbourn was served by the parish church of St Peter and St
              Paul. Established by 1200, by the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries it comprised an
              early thirteenth-century tower and a late thirteenth- and early fourteenth-century
              nave, chancel, and south porch. A vicarage house had been built by 1330 on the south
              side of the churchyard and the guilds of the Trinity, Holy Cross, and St John the
              Baptist partially supplied the vicars. The churchwardens were the heads of the Trinity
              guild, and a guildhall may have stood from 1475 on land purchased from Richmonds
                manor.<note type="foot"><title>VCH: Cambridgeshire</title>, vol 8, pp 12–30,

              by 1498–1501.<note type="foot">Dymond, <title>Churchwardens' Book</title>, pp xiii–xx

            <p><rs ref="eats:303814" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Wisbech</rs> sits in the far
              northeast of Cambridgeshire and was the largest town in the Isle of Ely. The town was
              very closely affiliated with the <rs ref="eats:328455" type="Collective_Office"
                >bishops of Ely</rs> and it was at the insistence of Bishop Goodrich that the town
              received a charter and was incorporated in 1549. This incorporation gave the burgesses
              right of perpetual succession, licensed them to buy, sell, grant, lease, and exchange
              their lands, established an annual 1 November meeting and election, and provided
              salary for a schoolmaster. An inland port, Wisbech lies on the Nene River about
              thirteen miles south-southwest of the river’s mouth at the Wash. The town's existence
              as a trading centre from the early Middle Ages was likely due to its location and by
              1327 it was granted the right to hold a fair for twenty days, beginning Trinity Sunday
              (though the date shifted to the festival of St Peter and St Paul by the end of the
              fifteenth century).<note type="foot"><title>VCH: Cambridgeshire</title>, vol 4, pp

            <p>The town centre is dominated by Wisbech Castle, which overlooks both the Old Market,
              so-called from 1221, and the New Market. The castle itself is said to have have been
              built by William the Conqueror following the defeat of Hereward, and although it may
              have been granted to the bishopric of Ely immediately upon construction, it was
              certainly held by the See by 1215. A regular visiting location for <rs
                ref="eats:205235" type="Person_Royalty">Edward I</rs>, the castle was used from the
              thirteenth to the sixteenth centuries as a prison and a location for the bishop’s
              courts. In the reign of Elizabeth, it was used, like the Bishop's Palace at Ely, as a
              prison for Catholic recusants.<note type="foot"><title>VCH: Cambridgeshire</title>,

              Wisbech leaves no record of craft guilds, although the town had nine documented
              religious guilds: St Peter’s (from 1327), St John Baptist, Our Lady, St Thomas, Corpus
              Christi (all from the reign of Richard II), Holy Trinity (from before 1379), St

              the most important of these guilds. The membership was fairly constant at about
              sixty-five to seventy guildsmen, and Holy Trinity had a guildhall in Wisbech from
              before 1423, when repairs to the structure are mentioned in the records. The guildhall
              no longer stands and its location is unknown; it was, however, rented by the other
              guilds of the town in 1462 and was used by the guild for their annual festival and

            <p>Wisbech also had a small hospital which began as a grant of five cottages and five
              acres of arable land to establish a poor house, and which by 1343 was styled as the
              Hospital of St John the Baptist. As a town foundation lacking ecclesiastical rights,
              however, it seems to have fallen into vacancy during the plague in the 1350s.<note

              northwest of Wisbech, shared the protection of the Roman Bank and lies just inside the
              sea wall. As with Wisbech, much of the land in and around Leverington had been
              purchased by the bishop and prior of Ely from 1109. Like Bassingbourn, Leverington had
              several notable manor houses, including those located in Richmond manor (built at some
              point in the late fourteenth century and demolished in the nineteenth), Graces manor
              (a conventual manor sold at the Dissolution, with the house located in Newfield), and
              Fitton (ruinous by 1459). The village had three religious guilds: St Mary’s (founded
              1386), St John’s (present before 1525), and the Holy Trinity (present by 1528). The St
              Mary’s guild used the chapel now called Swaine Chapel in the church of <rs

              the St John’s guild was constructed at some point before 1525 but no longer remains.
              The Holy Trinity guild seems to have been affiliated with the guild of the same name
              at Wisbech. Leverington was served by the church of St Leonard, constructed in the
              middle of the thirteenth century and heavily reworked in the second half of the
              fifteenth century.<note type="foot">Nikolaus Pevsner, <title>The Buildings of England:

              and the Granta River on the south, along the county border with Essex. The site was
              likely settled before Roman times and was by 1008 the location of two towns, Great and
              Little Linton, which were combined into a single parish in the twelfth century. This
              parish was served by the church of St Mary. The church dates from the twelfth century,
              though it was heavily renovated and reworked (including the nave and west tower) in

              1484). Although the parish was governed by the Linton manor court, which met
              biannually from 1509, the churchwardens seem for the most part to have been acting
              independently from the time of the records; their duties included management of the
              Old Guildhall which had been leased by Pembroke College. In addition to the parish

              Philip Parys directed funds to pay for a schoolmaster. A resident schoolmaster seems
              to have been in place by the 1570s and a schoolhouse was built in the northwest corner

          <div xml:id="cambs_hb_schools">

            <p>Perhaps because of the number of scholars trained at the university, Cambridgeshire
              possessed a number of schools and itinerant <rs ref="eats:17037"
                type="Collective_Occupations">schoolmasters</rs>, particularly in the later
              sixteenth century and the start of the seventeenth century. Drawing on the Ely
              diocesan records, Spufford provides an image of ‘readily available’ education in
              southern Cambridgeshire from 1574 to about 1628:</p>

            <p>'There were twenty-three places where a school seems to have been kept more or less
              continuously during the sixty years. Most of these were in the larger villages. The
              settlements on the fen-edge, which had had over a hundred households in 1563 like
              Cottenham, Waterbeach, Bottisham and Fulbourn, had them. The larger villages in or
              near the Cam valley, like Great Shelford, Barrington, Sawston and Linton, which had
              accommodated over fifty households had them, and so also did the larger villages in
              the upper Rhee valley, like Melbourn and Bassingbourn... Market towns, like Linton,
              were obvious foci for schools, and were both easily accessible and much visited, so
              that they had a large catchment area. It is noticeable that the ancient market town of
              Bourn was the only settlement on the western clay plateau of Cambridgeshire to have a
              well-established school.'</p>

            <p>Apart from these twenty-three well-established schools, masters were continuously
              referred to in another nine villages either up to or after 1600. These villages also
              had scattered references in the later, or earlier, period, and they may well have had
              schools consistently for a much longer period.<note type="foot">Spufford,
                  <title>Contrasting Communities</title>, pp 183–4. For a full discussion of the
                impact this density of education had on the peasantry and the village community, see
                Spufford, <title>Contrasting Communities</title>, pp 169–218.</note></p>

            <p>Some details can support Spufford's synopsis. <rs ref="eats:304511"
                type="Place_PA_Settlement">Waterbeach</rs> had a series of schoolmasters, including
              the vicar of the town about 1596, with another recorded between 1628 and 1635.<note

            <p>Following the Dissolution, records of cathedral activity in Ely are sparse, and until

              establishment of the grammar school at Ely (as at Peterborough), to be maintained by
              the now available monastic funds. The students admitted were expected to be able to
              read and write, be between nine to fifteen years old, and stay at the school until
              they were literate and fluent in Latin.<note type="foot">Owen and Thurley,
                  <title>King’s School</title>, pp 2–3.</note> At Ely the provisions for the school
              at its foundation were clear:</p>

            <p>'[T]here were to be twenty-four boys on the foundation, who were to be taught by a
              master and an usher. Only Latin and Greek are mentioned in the subjects of study
              (Hebrew was certainly expected in some schools, and is mentioned in the Elizabethan
              statutes at Ely). The boys were to be fed at a common table, and were to be given
              fifteen shillings per year and two and a half yards of cloth every Christmas for gowns
              which they were to wear whenever they processed in public. The two masters, one to be
              skilled in both Latin and Greek, the other in Latin, would have their livery too, and
              would be paid respectively &#163;11.15s.4d and &#163;4.5s.10d; they were to teach not
              only the foundation scholars, but any others who came to the school for the sake of
              learning. They and their scholars were to sit in the cathedral choir on feast days. At
              six every morning the school was to open with some of the prayers to be found in the
              proper of the mass, and it was to close at 5 p.m. with the psalms and prayers from the
              office of compline.'<note type="foot">Owen and Thurley, <title>King’s School</title>,

            <p>Though no record of changes is apparent in Queen Mary’s reign, in the reign of
              Elizabeth the subjects were expanded to include music, Hebrew grammar, and writing

              Joseph Henry Gray notes, ‘[t]here can be no doubt that [Tyndall] owed his promotion to
              Lord Leicester’s influence,’ particularly since one of the fellows of Queen’s had
              written to Dudley the year before, arguing that Tyndall was too young (at the age of
              30) to be raised to the position.<note type="foot">Gray, <title>Queen’s
                  College</title>, 121.</note> After this Tyndall was elected vice-chancellor of

            <p>Tyndall seems to have been dynamic and effective as vice-chancellor and his
              activities and policies there may inform his actions as dean of Ely. Gray describes
              ‘[h]is views were Calvinistic to a marked degree,’ while adding that ‘a predilection
              for Calvinistic doctrine by no means implied a love for Calvinistic discipline.’<note
                type="foot">Gray, <title>Queen’s College</title>, p 122.</note> Evincing an aversion
              to ‘any Puritan laxity,’ Tyndall ‘held the reins of government with a hand as firm as
              ever his predecessor had done.’<note type="foot">Gray, <title>Queen’s College</title>,
                p 123.</note> This behaviour is clear in his examination of John Smith of Christ’s
              College, who preached in an <rs ref="eats:328855" type="CalendarDay_Liturgical">Ash
                Wednesday</rs> sermon on play performance on the sabbath in the colleges.<note

                1151–2.</note> Tyndall, along with a number of doctors, ruled that the sabbath was
              not ‘violated when something is done that would be neither necessary nor of a
              religious nature,’ claiming that ‘only those actions shall not hinder religious
              observance or even be a slight stumbling-block to the brethren.’<note type="foot"

              reveals a desire to restrain the actions of members of the university when it came to
              their critiques of public performance, Tyndall was primarily concerned with public
              order, as Nelson comprehensively explores in his discussion of the Cambridge records

            <p>Tyndall faced similar challenges as dean of the King's School at Ely — following the
              apparently exemplary mastership of Speght — when he and the school had to deal with a
              series of less than reputable masters, including Mark Holdred (1598–1604), who was
              imprisoned, possibly for debt, soon after Tyndall's tenure began.<note type="foot"
                >Owen and Thurley, <title>King’s School</title>, pp 4–5.</note> Holdred was followed
              by William Pamplyn, whom Tyndall dismissed in 1609 for a variety of offenses,

            <p>The parish of Haslingfield contained two lay fees which were gradually combined in
              the eleventh century and twelfth centuries to form Scales manor. This was home to the
              Scales family from 1299, when <rs ref="eats:328888" type="Person_Male">Robert</rs> (d.
              1305) was granted the title Baron Scales. The manor subsequently acquired additional
              land, including that of the Somery family, and remained until 1486, when it was
              divided following the deaths of <rs ref="eats:328906" type="Person_Male">Thomas</rs>,
              seventh Baron Scales (1460), his daughter Elizabeth (1473), and finally her husband
              Anthony Wydeville, second Earl Rivers (<hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1440–83). Haslingfield
              then passed from the Tyndall and Felbrigge families before being sold to Dr <rs

              chantries, and Minchins manor between 1546 and 1550, thus owning the majority of the
              parish of Haslingfield. The Wendy's manor house, Haslingfield Hall, was built during
              Thomas Wendy’s lifetime and remains today.<note type="foot"><title>VCH:

              Cambridgeshire under Edward VI and, having supported Queen Mary early in her reign,
              was knighted in 1553 and subsequently made vice-chamberlain, privy councillor, and
              captain of King Philip’s guard in England. The first manor house at Sawston was built
              by 1279 and expanded by the fifteenth century to have a hall, two cross chambers,
              thirty other chambers, outhouses, gatehouses, barns, stables, and a dovecot. In 1553
              it was burned by Protestants – possibly including <rs ref="eats:160946"

              1557 to 1584; Huddleston himself, however, died at the very outset of the project. The

            <p>The 1530s, however, also marked Edward’s movement into royal circles and his primary
              residence seems to have remained in London. In April 1545 Edward purchased the London
              Charterhouse, where he hosted Queen Elizabeth for November 1558 and July 1561, and
              which saw his wife’s death in 1560 and his own death on 31 December 1564. In 1531,
              under the favour of Sir Brian Tuke, treasurer of the chamber, Edward became clerk of
              parliaments, where he worked for Thomas Cromwell. Perhaps because of Cromwell’s
              influence, Edward was appointed treasurer of the court of Augmentations in 1539; he
              was subsequently knighted in 1542, appointed chancellor of the court of Augmentations
              in 1544, and in 1547 became a member of the Privy Council. Although Edward backed the
              duke of Northumberland’s attempt to place Lady Jane Grey on the throne in 1553 and was
              subsequently removed from the Privy Council, he seems to have retained a degree of
              royal favour and was created Lord North in April 1554. For the remainder of his life
              Edward seems to have moved into retirement, spending more time at Kirtling, where his
              wife Alice was buried in 1560 and he himself interred in 1565.<note type="foot">P.R.N.

            <p>Edward was succeeded by his son Roger (1531–1600). Possibly educated — like his
              younger brother, Thomas — at Peterhouse, Cambridge, Roger was admitted to Lincoln’s
              Inn in 1542 and Gray’s Inn in 1561. About 1547 he married <rs ref="eats:329972"

                type="Person_Nobility">Richard Rich</rs>, first Baron Rich, by whom he had three
              sons and one daughter. The eldest son died in infancy, his second son, John,
              predeceased him in 1597, his third son, Henry, survived him, but Roger was succeeded
              by John’s son, Dudley. Roger was apparently introduced to court early, learning to
              joust in tournament and, like his father, dividing his time between London and
              Cambridgeshire. He served as senior knight of the shire for the county in 1555, 1559,
              and 1563, as well as JP in 1558–9, alderman and free burgess of Cambridge in 1568,
              lord lieutenant of the county in 1569, and high steward in 1572. After his father’s
              death Roger sold the Charterhouse to Thomas Howard, duke of Norfolk, and seems to have
              settled more permanently in Cambridgeshire to manage his estates. As John Craig notes,
              ‘North dominated county politics and threw his energies into local administration ...
              organizing county musters, serving as a subsidy commissioner, supervising schemes for
              draining the fens, or investigating matters brought to his attention by the privy
              council.’ Roger also made use of the now enlarged and lavish Kirtling Hall, hosting
              Elizabeth in the summer of 1578 for two days.<note type="foot">John Craig, ‘North,

            <p>In his duties as administrator in Cambridgeshire, Roger also clashed with university
              and church officials over a number of issues, including disputes over local and
              visiting players.<note type="foot">Nelson, <title>Cambridge</title>, vol 2, p 797. See

              of the university to prohibit travelling players from performing in Chesterton,
              including those licensed by North himself, Roger went on to question officially the
              authority of the vice-chancellor of the university in imprisoning a townsman in 1580.
              In 1591 he appealed to the Privy Council at the vice-chancellor’s attempt to arrest
              one of his retainers, Richard Parish.<note type="foot">Frederick S. Boas,

              Following 1574 Roger clashed with Richard Cox, bishop of Ely, who had refused to grant
              North a lease on Somersham, Huntingdonshire; in December 1575, North produced a bill
              of complaint against Cox, accusing him of mismanagement of the diocesan estates.
              Though a compromise was reached, the ‘issue reflected [North’s] distaste for a
              powerful and wealthy episcopate.’<note type="foot">John Craig, ‘North, Roger, second

            <p>Roger was also, however, prominent at court, being admitted to the chamber in 1558,
              created a knight of the Bath at Elizabeth’s coronation in 1559, and playing in the
              grand tournament in Greenwich Park in July 1559. He acted with Thomas Radcliffe, third
              earl of Sussex, as special ambassador to Vienna in 1567–8 at Elizabeth’s request,
              possibly accompanied Francis Walsingham to France in 1570 to negotiate tolerance for
              the Huguenots, and travelled to Lyon from October to December 1574 to congratulate
              Henri II on his succession of Charles IX. Close friends with Robert Dudley from the
              late 1560s, he witnessed Dudley’s marriage to Lettice Knollys in 1578, had custody of
              Dudley’s illegitimate son Robert (by Baroness Douglas Sheffield), and in 1585
              travelled with Dudley and his own son, Sir John North, to the Netherlands. There he
              served as governor of Flushing, Utrecht, and Harlingen in 1586, remaining active in
              the Netherlands (with periodic returns to England) until 1588. Roger finally was
              appointed privy councillor and treasurer of the household in 1596 and died at his
              house in Charterhouse Square on 3 December 1600. He was interred at Kirtling 12
              February 1601.</p>

            <p>Roger North’s younger brother, Thomas (1535–?1603) is best known as a translator of
              European texts. These included the Spanish <title>The Diall of Princes</title> (1557,
              revised in 1568), the Italian <title>Morall Philosophie</title> (1570), and a
              translation from the French of Plutarch, <title>The Lives of the Noble Grecians and
                Romanes</title> (1574); it has been long held that Shakespeare relied on North’s
              translation of this last for his Roman plays. Thomas was at least sometimes resident
              at Kirtling but his primary residence from 1576, when Roger purchased a lease for his
              brother, is uncertain.<note type="foot">Tom Lockwood, ‘North, Sir Thomas (1535–1603?),

            <p>Roger North’s son, Sir <rs ref="eats:317516" type="Person_Nobility">John</rs> (<hi
                rend="italic">c</hi> 1550–1597), entered Peterhouse College at a young age in 1562
              and was placed under <rs ref="eats:131578" type="Person_Clergy">John Whitgift</rs>,
              later archbishop of Canterbury. When Whitgift became master of Trinity College in
              1567, North changed colleges to follow him; he took his MA in May 1572. In the same
              year North — like his father — was admitted to Gray’s Inn. Unlike his father or
              grandfather, and although he served as MP for the county for the parliaments of 1584,
              1586, and 1588, North’s focus was not the family’s county seat at Kirtling. He is
              instead best known for his extensive travel, for both personal and military purposes,
              across the Continent and to Ireland.</p>

            <p>In October 1575 John travelled to Italy to finish his education and remained there
              until November 1577; he kept a travel journal during this time, which comprises one of
              the major sources for his activities in the records. John spent time in the
              Netherlands and the Palatinate, meeting there veterans of the Dutch revolt. He
              returned to the Netherlands again in the spring of 1577/8 to fight with the Dutch as a
              gentleman volunteer and stayed until 1580, when he returned to England to marry <rs

              seeking military advancement through a commission of a regiment, and rejecting the
              seniority of Sir John Norreys. Perhaps because of his family’s close ties with Dudley,
              John won the contract and returned to England to raise troops in April of that
                year.<note type="foot">John S. Nolan, <title>Sir John Norreys and the Elizabethan

            <p>The family’s seat in Cambridgeshire was Kirtling Hall, constructed by Edward North in
              the 1540s and 1550s. Before its acquisition by the North family, Kirtling Castle was,
              through most of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, a walled structure with a
              moat and bridge and an encircling ditch and palisade. Although inhabited at times, any
              buildings within these defenses were reported to be ruined before 1400, and a new
              hall, kitchen, longhouse, and chapel were all built in the early fourteenth century.
              The hall contained a parlour, solar, two chambers at the east end, pantry, buttery,
              and a passage to the kitchen; some of these buildings may have been retained in Edward
              North’s renovations. Edward’s new construction, however, was significantly larger
              (about 35 square metres) and included additions of a gatehouse, gallery,
              lodging-house, and banqueting house. In the seventeenth century the hall underwent
              further renovations and additions and by the 1660s it was the largest country house in
              the county, with sixty hearths. After this point, however, Kirtling Hall was slowly
              reduced in size and was used less often; by the 1770s it had fallen into such
              disrepair that it was uninhabitable and it was demolished in 1801. The gatehouse was
              retained and converted into a residential building, Kirtling Tower.<note type="foot"

            <p>Featured in the household accounts of John and Dorothy North, Kirtling Hall also
              seems to have been a location of literary production during the time of Roger North.
              It was the temporary residence of Thomas North when he wrote <title>The Diall of
                Princes</title> and perhaps <title>Morall Philosophie</title>. During this same

              to North’s <title>Description of Swedland</title>, George was the son of a London

            entertainment, dramatic production, travelling performers, and other forms of public
            performance were, in Cambridgeshire outside of Cambridge, largely restricted to
            religious institutions such as Ely Cathedral and Priory, with sparse secular evidence in
            the North of Kirtling accounts. The records of the <rs ref="eats:3576"
              type="Collective_Office">churchwardens</rs> of Sts Peter and Paul (Bassingbourn), St

            towns, sponsored by the corporate organizations therein.</p>

          <p>Among Cambridgeshire's religious institutions, surviving records detail payments for
            outside performers at Anglesey, Barnwell, and Ely. The Ely records provide regular
            evidence for the entertainment of magnates and royalty throughout the period (including
            at Barnwell, a regular lodging place for the bishop), befitting Ely’s prominence as a
            frequent host to nobility and a major force in national politics. Further, the King’s
            School at Ely, established after the Dissolution, gives some evidence of school drama in
            the early seventeenth century (see <ptr target="#cambs-ridp288473096"/>), by way of an
            accusation that the school hosted <rs ref="eats:18451" type="Entertainer_Type"

          <p>Evidence for Cambridgeshire's noble households, as represented by the North of Kirtling

          <p>The earliest records of local entertainment are in the accounts of the Holy Trinity

            payments to travelling performers from nearby Wisbech, as well as other towns in other
            counties, including Fitton Fen, Kirton Fen, and Spalding, Lincolnshire. The most
            detailed records, however, are found in the churchwardens’ accounts of Sts Peter and
            Paul (see the <ref

          <p>With these exceptions, the extant records for the thirty-three towns represented in
            the collection offer little evidence of performance activity, beyond what is documented
            in the diocesan court records. Such activity was varied and at times obscure, with more typical records of music, dancing during the Sabbath, and enduring <rs ref="eats:79074" type="Entertainment_FolkCustom">Morris</rs> customs featuring
            alongside accusations of cross-dressing (see <ptr

          <p>It is the accounts related to the bishopric of <rs ref="eats:322579"
              type="Place_PA_Settlement">Ely</rs> that present the greatest evidence for public
            performance. Among the earliest are those of Bishop Thomas Arundel (1353–1414),
            detailing a payment to performers at <rs ref="eats:322723" type="Place_F_ReligiousHouse"
              >Barnwell</rs> (see <ptr target="#cambs-ridp257931800"/>). The household accounts of
            Bishop Matthew Wren (1585–1667) feature records that predate his tenure by more than a
            century (probably because of Wren’s focus on historical record-keeping), itemizing
            payments in 1409–10 to several minstrels through the <rs ref="eats:41461"

            Thomas, fourth Baron Morley (<hi rend="italic"
              >c</hi> 1354–1416). Ely’s prominence continued through the later Middle
            Ages and early modern period, with Bishop <rs ref="eats:304598" type="Person_Nobility"
              >John Morton</rs>’s (d. 1500) lavish feast celebrating his 1479 installation (see the
              <ptr target="#cambs-ridp280978568"/>), which presents an attempt to make peace
            following the complicated religious and political factionalism of the Wars of the Roses.
            In the next century, Bishop <rs ref="eats:326811" type="Person_Clergy">Nicholas

          <p>Although the Cambridgeshire monasteries offer little evidence of dramatic performance,
            the priories and abbeys of <rs ref="eats:324477" type="Place_F_ReligiousHouse">Ely</rs>,

            patronized travelling troupes and entertainment from the fourteenth to the sixteenth
            centuries. At Ely visiting troupes were often those patronized by major political
            figures in East Anglia; the prior’s household accounts (see <ptr

              type="Entertainer_Type">minstrels</rs>. The earliest record for Ely Priory dates from

            1430/1) paid four men for playing an interlude, as well two minstrels. During the

              type="CalendarDay_Liturgical">Candlemas</rs>, Peter also made payments to ‘various

              with disrupting holidays, sermons, and the Sabbath, but only a few mention the
              Christmas season in particular, if extended to Candlemas. Two of these seem linked to
              New Year’s Day events (see the <ptr target="#cambs-ridp261223608"/>), 1 January

              diocesan courts, however, record a large number of infractions during this period. In

              in Cambridgeshire, although these are the only surviving records from the county to
              refer to the practice. Dymond describes the custom as a ‘rollicking festival, held in
              the second week after Easter (usually on the Monday and Tuesday of that week)’ which
              featured contests, games, and sports. Further, '[a]s at most social gatherings, the
              opportunity was taken to collect money for the parish':</p>

            <p>'Churchwardens recorded the receipt of "hocking money" at Bassingbourn on ten
              occasions between 1497 and 1534, but its incidence was probably higher and sometimes
              concealed under other income. Although references are fairly brief, the majority show
              that money was received from the married women of the parish.'<note type="foot">David
                Dymond, <title>Churchwardens’ Book</title>, p lviii.</note></p>

            <p>Entertainment at these events is not recorded, and the practices and games specific
              to Bassingbourn are likewise not noted. Peter Greenfield offers further insight:</p>

            <p>'The most common form of the festivity involved groups of men or women taking
              "prisoner" individuals of the opposite sex and forcing them to pay a fine to be
              released. Regional variations appear to have been common, however ... [t]he women were
              always the victors and in fact the women usually end up dominating the men at Hocktide
              and gathering the largest sum for the parish. The funds thus gathered were given to
              the parish especially for poor relief but also to pay for repairs to the church fabric
              and other parish expenses.'<note type="foot">Peter Greenfield and Jane Cowling, <ref

            <p>After Hocktide the liturgical calendar would lead, two weeks later, to the Rogation
              Days of later May, and then, thirty-nine days after Easter, to the Feast of the
              Ascension. It is here that the great majority of outdoor festivals, including both
              church ales and fairs would commence.</p>

                type="Entertainment_Type">ales</rs> and fairs (see 'Historical Background'), few of
              the records explicitly mention performance, with some exceptions. It seems likely,
              however, based on critiques by ecclesiastical authorities and the inclusion of
              performance-related activities on lists of condemnable practices issued by the <rs
                ref="eats:328455" type="Collective_Office">bishops of Ely</rs> in the fifteenth and

            <p>In his 1579 injunctions (see <ptr target="#cambs-ridp257976008"/> Bishop Richard Cox
              addresses various seasonal festivities, noting that 'the Saboth day is so fondly
              abused in going vnto Fayers and visiting of frendes, and acquaintances, and in
              feasting and making of good chere, in wanton dawnsing, in lewd maygames sometyme

              Bishop Lancelot Andrewes (<ptr target="#cambs-ridp257933736"/>), though fairs are not
              specifically mentioned. Bishop Wren, finally, in his 1638 visitation articles (<ptr
                target="#cambs-ridp292111096"/>), asks whether any of the parish churches have
              suffered 'prophane vsage,' including both fairs and church ales, seeking to know
              whether 'Playes, Feasts, Banquets, Suppers, Church-ales, Drinkings, Temporall Courts,
              Liets, or Lay-iuries, Musters, exercise of dancing, stoole-ball, foot-ball, or the
              like, or any Faires, or Markets, boothes, stalls or standings… [have] beene suffered
              to be kept in your Church, Chappell or Church-yard.' Although both St Edward’s parish
              in Cambridge and Swavesey parish reply to these articles (<ptr
                target="#cambs-ridp257913144"/>), insisting that they have not suffered 'drinkings'
              or 'Church Ales,' it is notable that many other parishes’ responses are quite brief
              and do not touch on churchyard indiscretions.<note type="foot">See Palmer,

            <p>Wren’s criticism is indicative of an opposition to church ales particular only to
              certain areas of England. As R.A. Houston observes, church ales and parish festivities
              could be '[r]obustly defended in some parts,' especially 'the Midlands, south-west,

              to have been less common in East Anglia, including Cambridgeshire, which experienced a
              'quick demise' since funds could be procured through rental incomes in the larger
              urban parishes, and since poor relief was offered by religious guilds and

              charitable activity until the 1540s. Church ales are very frequently mentioned: while
              the majority are May ales (Whitsunday or Whitmonday) and mid-Lenten Sunday ales, 'a

            <p>Barnwell also had a popular Midsummer Fair, commencing 22 June and initially lasting
              three days, but extended to two weeks in the late fourteenth century. Nelson presents
              one record from the thirteenth century (BL: MS Harley 3601) that supports the claim
              for performance at this event:</p>

            <p>'Concerning the site of Barnwell ... that is, on the eve of the nativity of St John
              the Baptist, boys and youths, coming together there, took part in wrestling in the
              English manner and other boyhood games and praised one another in turn with songs and
              musical instruments'.</p>

                type="foot">Nelson, <title>Cambridge</title>, vol 2, pp 987, 1196. Nelson includes
                the record in his Appendix 2, 'Cambridge Ghosts,' which collects 'misunderstandings
                or mistranscriptions.' In this case, the name 'Barnwell' was misunderstood to have
                derived from 'children's well,' and the tradition of the Midsummer Fair itself from
                'the resort of children and young persons thither yearly on Midsummer Eve' (Nelson,
                  <title>Cambridge</title>, vol 2, p 987; citing John Willis Clark, <title>Liber

            <p>Even so, no contemporary records of performance at Barnwell survive.</p>

            <p>Beyond the play presented at Bassingbourn in celebration of St Margaret’s Day (20

              detail, but notes 2d paid on Whitmonday 1500 (7 June) 'ffor a <rs ref="eats:70656"

                type="Entertainer_Type">taberer</rs> and minstrel (f 19v). Far more detailed,
              however, are the many expenses associated with the Sunday, 20 July 1511 (St Margaret’s
              Day), production of a <rs ref="eats:326774" type="Drama_TitledWork">play of St
                George</rs>. Producing over 150 entries in the accounts (ff 30v–2), the play cost £4
              1s 10d, and (somewhat unsuccessfully) brought in a profit of £1 12s 11½d. Bassingbourn
              raised 16s for the play and sought support from twenty-seven rural villages, nineteen
              of which were located in Cambridgeshire (six others in Hertfordshire and one in
              Bedfordshire), and all but one of which was no more than ten miles from Bassingbourn,
              as well as from the market town of Royston. As the play has already been considered at
              length by Anne Brannen, Stephen Doree, and David Dymond, the following discussion will
              offer only an overview.<note type="foot">Brannen, ‘Parish Play Accounts,’ pp 55–72,

            <p>The date for the play 'may have been chosen partly as a token of respect for Lady

              calves, and four chickens were reserved for 'the gentlemen,' and an additional half a
              sheep was used in the making of <rs ref="eats:40978" type="Thing_FoodDrink"
                >pasties</rs> on the Tuesday after the play, all of which indicates an audience of
              hundreds.</p>

            <p>As Dymond notes, 'the wardens and parishioners of Bassingbourn must have worked hard
              to advertise the forthcoming play, to persuade people to attend, and to encourage the
              giving of money, materials, and labour.'<note type="foot">Dymond,
                  <title>Churchwardens’ Book</title>, p lxiii.</note> The banns were announced the
              Wednesday before and the Cambridge waits were hired for the Wednesday and the Sunday.
              During the carrying of the banns, the attending players were given lunch at <rs
                ref="eats:326157" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Royston</rs>. The stages were set up on
              at least two days: the Friday (hence the payments for fish to feed the people putting
              up stages) and the Saturday (hence the payments for beef to feed the people putting up
              stages). A number of the townspeople who supplied malt and wheat for the church ales
              also contributed the same for the ale served at the play, and celebrations following
              the play continued for two or three days after.</p>

            <p>The production was not a financial success, but 'the main legacy of the play was,' as
              Dymond notes, 'surely an increased enthusiasm for the cult of St George, and the
              establishment of a special fund to commission an image of him’ (f 32), a goal finally
              achieved in 1522, when the image, carved by Robert Ives of Saffron Walden, was
              installed in the church (only to be torn down as idolatrous between 1538 and
                1549).<note type="foot">Dymond, <title>Churchwardens’ Book</title>, p

            <p>Beyond these records and those of players and interludes at Cambridgeshire's

              performance, most prominently through the diocesan court proceedings. A number of the

              least two of these occasions the players are identified as either scholars or as
              school children and their master. These school performances also travelled to
              Lincolnshire in the same time period; at the church in Long Sutton 'the churchwardens
              paid 6s 6d "to the children of wisbich whan they played here".' Stokes notes that
              records such as these serve as an 'indicator of involvement by schools in drama during
              the second half of the sixteenth century,' as illustrated by 'payments to travelling
              troupes of children’ as also seen in a 1572–3 payment at Long Sutton '"to the children

              member of the Pamplyn family that resided in Cambridgeshire, at Fen Ditton,
              Chesterton, Burwell, Ely, and Gnapwell.<note type="foot">See, for example, the
                notarial instrument regarding a debt owed to the prior of Anglesey by a John Pamplyn
                in 1500 (TNA E 135/22/6), as well as the wills of John (d. <hi rend="italic">c</hi>

                the certificates of residence for a Robert Pamphline in the last two decades of the
                sixteenth century (TNA E 115/305/82).</note> Pamplyn’s will dictates that he be
              buried in the parish church of Chesterton and lists two sons, John and Nathaniel, and
              two daughters, Elizabeth and <rs ref="eats:327132" type="Person_StatusOther"
              >Anna</rs>.</p>

            <p>The charges against Pamplyn are extensive: the record accuses him of receiving no
              scholars into his school unless they pay him bribes, teaching from his own irregular
              collection of books rather than a fixed curriculum, and being absent from the school
              for days at a time. Finally and most importantly, Pamplyn is accused of a number of
              moral infractions: that both he and some of his scholars are <rs ref="eats:45671"
                type="CrimesMisdemeanors">absent from church</rs> and that his daughter teaches
              dancing at night when Pamplyn is absent, during which time she <rs ref="eats:45484"
                type="CrimesMisdemeanors">dresses in boy’s clothes and has the boys dress in
                hers</rs>. Though unnamed in the record, this is very likely Anna, who seems to be
              unmarried or childless at the time of his will and to whom Pamplyn leaves all his
              English books.</p>

            <p>The accusations against Anna, importantly, were cancelled by Tyndall. Tyndall’s
              reaction to the very recent unrest at <rs ref="eats:328290" type="Place_F_School"
                >King’s College</rs>, 1607, and his subsequent actions in the riot of 1611, as well
              as his condemnation of Smith and other university member’s sermons, would seem to
              indicate that his antipathy to disorder was great (see 'Historical Background:
              Humphrey Tyndall and the King's School, Ely'). From this perspective, Anna’s actions
              were worthy of condemnation, particularly given early modern attitudes towards
              cross-dressing and its potential, as David Cressy observes, to 'signal subversion,
              resistance, and transgression' and 'upset patriarchal values, assault cultural
              boundaries, and unravel the sexual separators of ambivalence, androgyny, and
                eroticism.'<note type="foot">David Cressy, ‘Gender Trouble and Cross-Dressing in
                Early Modern England,’ <title>Journal of British Studies</title> 35 (October 1996),
                439. It should be noted, however, that Cressy argues against this prevailing view,
                claiming that ‘cross-dressing was not so transgressive as critics and scholars have
                suggested, nor was it necessarily symptomatic of a sex-gender system in distress’
                (‘Gender Trouble,’ p 439).</note> The available evidence, however, suggests a moral
              panic surrounding cross-dressing out of proportion to the actual practice or treatment
              of offenders. Cressy contends that contemporary diatribes are part of a
              'fundamentalist critique,' and argues that 'we need to differentiate kinds of behavior
              that the moralists deliberately blurred.'<note type="foot">Cressy, ‘Gender Trouble,’
                pp 445, 451.</note> In particular, he points out that '[t]heatrical cross-dressing'
              — here referring to characters that use cross-dress as a plotting device — 'is not
              portrayed as threatening, effeminizing, and certainly not an abomination unto the
                lord.'<note type="foot">Cressy, ‘Gender Trouble,’ p 458.</note></p>

            <p>Anna Bayman, citing an outpouring of pamphlets and preaching against cross-dressing
              in the second decade of the 1600s, sees a divergence between the pamphlets, which on
              the one hand 'offer an irreverent and, at times, politically charged take on the
              fashion for cross-dressing,' but also 'a systematic preaching campaign [which] could
              indeed exert significant pressure.'<note type="foot">Anna Bayman, ‘Cross-Dressing and
                Pamphleteering in Early Seventeenth-Century London,’ <title>Moral Panics, the Media,
                  and the Law in Early Modern England</title>, David Lemmings and Claire Walter
                (eds) (London, 2009), 65, 73.</note></p>

            <p>Bayman goes on to claim that actual punishments for cross-dressing were typically
              lenient, and Cressy notes that 'the courts, more interested in restoring charity and
              harmony than in meting out punishment, were content to secure acknowledgment of error
              and to pass out a mild rebuke,' with 'the stiffest punishment ... [being] performance
              of public penance.'<note type="foot">Bayman, ‘Cross-Dressing,’ p 73; Cressy, ‘Gender
                Trouble,’ p 461-2.</note> Together these conclusions present a society that was
              rhetorically concerned with cross-dressing, but in which ultimately it 'was neither
              the subversive abomination nor the eroticized transgression that some scholars have
                claimed.'<note type="foot">Cressy, ‘Gender Trouble,’ p 464.</note></p>

            <p>There is then ample contemporary justification for Tyndall's decision to strike the
              section concerning Anna, particularly considering his support for public performance
              despite the potential for disorder. Ursula Ann Potter suggests that Pamplyn’s daughter
              may have been acting in an official capacity and that '[d]ancing and cross-dressing by
              boys were sanctioned features of school drama where they were conducted under male
                authority.'<note type="foot">Ursula Ann Potter, ‘Performing Arts in the Tudor
                Classroom,’ <title>Tudor Drama before Shakespeare, 1485–1590</title>, Lloyd Kermode,

              instruction at the King's School could well have involved reading and performing
              comedies and dramatic dialogues in the language, although no records survive.<note

            <p>Discussing Tyndall’s letter, Lynn Enterline identifies the role that dramatic
              cross-dressing may have played in the construction of Latin training as 'a kind of
              "male puberty rite",' noting that '[w]ith great frequency over the course of the
              sixteenth century, schoolboys preserved—indeed, extended—the long-standing medieval
              custom of playing female parts on holidays. And they did so as part of their
              introduction into the successful performance of genteel masculinity.'<note type="foot"

                  Emotion</title> (Philadelphia, 2001), 17–18. Enterline here uses the phrase coined
                by Walter Ong, ‘Latin Language Study as a Renaissance Puberty Rite,’ <title>Studies
                  in Philology</title> 56.2 (April 1959), 103–124.</note> In addition to instances
              of cross-dressing at Ely, Enterline highlights records of dramatic cross-dressing at
              the grammar school attached to Magdalen College, Oxford from 1509, a performance at
              Greenwich on November 10, 1527, by the boys of St Paul’s School, and a general rapid
              increase in 'cross-dressing playing ... after 1525, beginning at Eton.'<note
                type="foot">Enterline, <title>Shakespeare’s Schoolroom</title>, p 18. For the record
                of a 1518 payment to the schoolmaster of Magdalen College ‘for the dyeing and making

                (Toronto, 2004), vol 1, 61; vol 2, 949.</note> The possibility exists, then, that
              Anna was training students in this or other forms of drama and that '[t]he
              transgression here is the fact it took place under female authority, which, as the
              complainants’ comments indicate, was socially and sexually suspect.'<note type="foot"
                >Potter, ‘Performing Arts,’ 157.</note> Given Pamplyn’s propensity for eschewing his
              duties and being often absent from the school, Tyndall may have elected to strike out
              a complaint about a potentially justified pedagogical enterprise and accepted that any
              irregularities were a result of Pamplyn’s irresponsibility and that Anna, effectively,
              was picking up her father's slack. Perhaps, too, the complaints brought by parents of
              the schoolboys or the townspeople represented a misunderstanding of the role and
              curriculum of a grammar school education, something Tyndall would have understood far
              more readily.</p>

            <p>The case of Pamplyn’s daughter and the King’s School is not the only evidence from
              the Cambridgeshire records of official leniency toward cross-dressing, in contrast to
              contemporary religious and social critique. The proceedings of the diocesan court held
              at <rs ref="eats:327734" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Babraham</rs> 29 January 1602 (see
                <ptr target="#cambs-ridp260128616"/>) report that Anna (also named Nan and Alicia
              later in record) <rs ref="eats:302921" type="Person_GenderUnknown">Pettingale</rs>,
              dressed in men’s apparel and was harboured by <rs ref="eats:302980" type="Person_Male"

                <rs ref="eats:303156" type="Person_Female">Joan Buninges</rs> with the same offence.
              Likewise in <rs ref="eats:322533" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Grantchester</rs>, 22
              February 1599/1600 (see <ptr target="#cambs-ridp260056888"/>), <rs ref="eats:314903"
                type="Person_StatusOther">Joan Bigges</rs>, a single woman, was brought before the

              sheet [et monuit eam ad peragend eand in Ecclesiam ibidem lodice indicta].' Though the
              wearing of a sheet might seem particular relevant to sumptuary or other sartorial
              infractions, this form of penance was in fact commonplace in the English church. As
              Emily Winerock notes in her study of dancing and other forms of disorder in
              churchyards, '[i]f the accused failed compurgation or admitted guilt, he or she would
              be assigned penance, which was typically performed barefoot and wearing a sheet, in
              the parish church.'<note type="foot">Emily Winerock, ‘Churchyard Capers: The

              Polsons in Bishops Frome, Herefordshire on the Sabbath evening of December 1619, who

              Cambridgeshire diocesan records bear this out: in addition to Joan Bigges, a piper by

              ill order on the Sabaoth dayes, &amp; being admonished by the Minister he would doe yt
              in spite of him.' For this, Spence was similarly ordered by the judge 'to do penance
              in the church of Sutton (covered) in a sheet and to certify [penitenciam faceiendam in
              Ecclesia de Sutton in lodice].' The terminology employed to describe the penitential
              garb could differ depending on the record, and perhaps indicate some degree of local
              variation, referred to variously as 'lodix' (for example, in 'lodice', 'lodice

              Although Darnton singles out the Feast of St John the Baptist, carnival, and Lent as
              periods when cat torture was particularly common, Bruce Boehrer notes 'that cats were
              tortured throughout early modern Europe on numerous occasions that do not bear any
              clear relation to seasonal [Christian] holidays.'<note type="foot">Boehrer,
                  <title>Animal Characters</title>, p 111.</note> The celebrations may be more
              closely and regularly connected to purported pagan witch festivals. In particular,
              Mardi Gras and Saint John’s Eve 'coincided with — and coopted ... Candlemas and
                Beltane.'<note type="foot">Boehrer, <title>Animal Characters</title>, p
              111.</note></p>

            <p>English examples of recreational cat murder are considerably sparser and seem not to
              mark religious or quasi-religious observances, but instead feature as 'impromptu
              divertissements,' similar in character to 'the charivari and its regional variants
              [ie, <hi rend="italic">faire le chat</hi> and Katzenmusik], which often employed cat
              abuse to help create ... rough music.'<note type="foot">Boehrer, <title>Animal
                  Characters</title>, pp 112–13.</note> Such cat abuses were widespread across
              England:</p>

            <p>'The nonseasonal practice of whipping a cat to death, for instance, proved lastingly
              popular in some parts of the realm. In 1615 Richard Braithwaite could ask
              rhetorically, "Set out a Pageant, whoo’l not thither runne, / As twere to whip the cat
              at Abington" (M1v). Over two centuries later a village inn at Albrighton in Shropshire
              still retained an inscription reading, "The finest pastime, that is under the sun, /
              Is whipping the cat at Albrighton". In a related vein, Benedick’s famous remark in
                <title>Much Ado about Nothing</title>, "If I do [marry], hang me in a bottle like a
              cat, and shoot at me" (1.1.256–57), alludes to a form of early English archery drill
              in which a live cat was placed in a bag or basket and used as a target.'<note
                type="foot">Boehrer, <title>Animal Characters</title>, p 113.</note></p>

            <p>Ritualistic cat murder was considerably less widespread: 'although the English
              followed the continental custom of building Midsummer’s Eve bonfires, they do not seem
              to have shared the French predilection for roasting cats in them,' and 'with the
              Reformation even the bonfires proved controversial since Protestant reformers
              concluded early on that the coincidence of Catholic feast days and ancient pagan
              festivals attested to the corruption of both.'<note type="foot">Boehrer, <title>Animal
                  Characters</title>, p 114.</note> Despite the Protestant mistrust of potentially
              corrupt practices, cat immolation was at times nevertheless a part of anti-Catholic
              celebration, though little evidence survives for such events as early as the 1630s. On
              Elizabeth Day (17 November, from her accession in 1558), bonfires were common and on
              the day in 1677 a celebration in London included the burning of cats in an effigy of
              the Pope, as well as 'mighty bonefires and ye burning of a most costly pope, caryed by
              four persons in divers habits, and ye effigies of 2 divells whispering in his eares,
              his belly filled full of live catts who squawled most hideously as soone as they felt
              the fire; the common saying all ye while, it wase ye language of ye Pope and ye Divel
              in a dialogue betwixt them.'<note type="foot">Boehrer, <title>Animal
                  Characters</title>, pp 115–16, citing Edward Maude Thompson (ed), Correspondence
                of the Family of Hatton, vol 1 (Westminster, 1878), 157.</note></p>

            <p>Boehrer identifies — in addition to the William Smith cat-burning in the records here
              — a case 'in 1643 [where] the parliamentary troopers who overran Lichfield Close used
              hounds to hunt cats through the cathedral on successive days,' an act that Katherine
              Rogers claims was 'to demonstrate their contempt for Anglican Churches.'<note

            <p>'Sunday the 8 of Aprill was a villanouse fact done in Cheape earlie or daye. A dead
              catt having a clothe lyke a vestment of the priest at masse with a crosse on it afore,

              was hanged on the post of the gallows in Cheape beyond the Crosse in the parishe of
              St. Mathewe, and a bottle hanged by it; which catt was taken downe at vi of the clock
              in the morninge and caried to the Bishop of London, and he caussed it to be shewed
              openlye in the sermon tyme at Paules Crosse in the sight of all the audience there
                present.'<note type="foot">Boehrer, <title>Animal Characters</title>, p 118, citing

            <p>Cambridgeshire offers no further evidence of ritualized cat torture or killing.
              Closer to Ely, the play <title>Gammer Gurton’s Needle</title> (produced at Christ’s
              College, Cambridge) features Gib the cat, who 'is held aloft — no doubt squirming —
              for a full scene while the bumpkin Hodge, convinced that Gib has swallowed the play’s
              lost needle, first threatens to kill him and then prepares to probe the animal’s
                rectum.'<note type="foot">Boehrer, <title>Animal Characters</title>, p 107.</note>
              This performance act, however, would seem rather to fall under the category of
              'impromptu divertissements,' than to be connected with either traditional Catholic and
              Continental (chiefly French) practices of burning cats as symbols of witchcraft, or
              English examples of ritual cat killing in anti-Catholic protest.</p>

            <p>For William Smith, however, the roasting of a cat on a spit may have had some
              significance, even though this instance precedes both anti-Catholic celebrations of
              Guy Fawkes and Elizabeth Day. As Alec Ryrie observes, '[t]raditional Christianity
              generously provided [milestones] in the liturgical calendar, but that calendar’s place
              in everyday life and devotion was directly challenged by the Reformation,'
              particularly since 'St Paul’s polemic against observing "dayes, and moneths, and
              times, and yeres" fitted well with Reformed Protestants’ wariness of treating any time
              or place as holier than any other.'<note type="foot">Alec Ryrie, <title>Being
                  Protestant in Reformation Britain</title> (Oxford, 2013), 456.</note> While
              England generally observed major feast days, the distrust of those days and the fear
              that they could lead to sloth and disorder meant that 'Protestants [both puritan and
              conformist] ... develop[ed] new ways of marking time.'<note type="foot">Ryrie,
                  <title>Being Protestant</title>, p 458.</note> The Sabbath day, for example,
              created an opportunity for 'earnest Protestants to take a retrospective look at the
              week’s sins and successes,' but '[t]here was also a need for more considered reviews
              at longer intervals.'<note type="foot">Ryrie, <title>Being Protestant</title>, p
                458.</note> A birthday allowed a Protestant to engage in one aspect of William
              Pemble’s encouragement for 'Christians to review their lives "every weeke, moneth, and
              yeare",' but New Year’s Day was also a popular, if ‘unacknowledged,’ Protestant feast
                day.<note type="foot">Ryrie, <title>Being Protestant</title>, pp 458–9.</note> Ryrie
              here cites the advice of Calvinist theologian Daniel Featley, who correlated the
              traditional feast day of the Circumcision of Christ with a request 'for spiritual
              circumcision and thanking God for the first-fruits of Christ’s blood to praying, "Thou
              hast begunne a new yeere, beginne in mee a new reformation".'<note type="foot">Ryrie,
                  <title>Being Protestant</title>, p 459.</note></p>

            <p>It is not certain that William Smith was burning a cat in a demonstration of
              Protestant zeal on New Year’s Day, perhaps concatenating his own spiritual rebirth
              with a show of anti-Catholic sentiment. He may just as likely have been celebrating
              the day with a traditional English 'impromptu divertissement'; the record is unclear.
              The significance of the day and the long history of cat immolation, however, at least
              signal at a potential meaning for the act.</p>

              construction of a new guildhall, and in 1508 Pembroke Hall leased a plot of rectory
              land to the northwest of the church for the project, and construction was nearly
              complete by 1523. After the suppression of the guilds in 1547, however, the Townhouse

              article, transcribed here, the complaints are, in short: that Wren sent officers to
              enforce the visitation and that the churchwardens were forced to take oaths; that Wren
              put a burden on 'the ministers, churchwardens, sidemen, assistants, midwives and
              divers others' by insisting on the visitation; that the people were burdened
              financially and temporally by the visitation during a difficult time; that moving the
              church furnishings in order to obey the decree was expensive; that there were too many
              pluralities and non-residences; that the small vicarages under the bishop or cathedral
              were not cared for and that many people were ignorant; eight, that the popish
              innovations of the bishop led many to revolt against the church; nine, that many
              farmers were leaving the county because things were so bad; ten, that being told when
              to sit and when to stand during divine services was profane and tyrannical; eleven,
              that probate and wills were costing too much; twelve, that there were too many
              pictures of the Trinity and the Virgin Mary in the churches; and, thirteen, that the
              apparitors came and took the keys away and would not let women teach school. </p>

                (place), etc, when the decree of this kind had been shown, etc, and the summons
                made, the said Cobbe appeared and, when he was charged with the article, claimed <hi

                second day in the presence of the churchwardens so affirming, enjoined him to pay
                12d to the poor box there, and to certify regarding that matter at the next court to
                be held at Wisbech, viz, on 24 July next. On which day, the lord (judge) pronounced
                him, having been cited, summoned and having not appeared, contumacious, etc, and
                excommunicated him as in the schedule. (A writ of excommunication) has been issued,
                and immediately the said Cobbe appeared and showed a certificate absolving him from
                that aforesaid payment of 12d, and so the lord (judge) dismissed him from his

              <ab>On 29 May 1581, Typpin appeared and denied that the article charged against him
                was true, and claimed that he was able to prove that the article aforesaid above was
                false. The lord (judge) granted him (that it was) so. Wherefore the lord (judge)
                assigned him to prove (it) at the next court. And on 30 May of the year aforesaid,
                Typpin appeared and introduced Richard Sherlocke and Thomas Smithe of the same town
                as witnesses, who, being sworn, (the holy gospels having been) touched, say <hi

            <p><rs ref="eats:317516" type="Person_Nobility">North</rs> held a dinner party on 21 February (f 29); the five musicians were probably
              paid to play during this event. North provides a list of his guests: William Bourchier
              (1557–1623), fourth earl of Bath; Thomas Perrott (1553–97), heir of Sir John Perrott,
              former lord deputy of Ireland; North’s uncle Sir <rs ref="eats:318602" type="Person_Nobility">Thomas North</rs> (1535–<hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1603),
              the translator of Plutarch’s <title>Lives</title>; his wife Elizabeth Rich and their
              son Edward North; a 'Greek lady,' North’s neighbour ('la uicina S{ignor}a Greca'); a
              woman called 'Buttlera' and her husband; 'the lady Mills'; Rocco Bonetti, an Italian
              fencing master and intelligencer; and <rs ref="eats:69202" type="Person_Commoner">Richard Knollys</rs> (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>1548–96), fifth son
              of Sir Francis Knollys (for these last two, see Gallagher, 'Italian London,' p
              99).</p>


            <p> 'Gionsono,' first mentioned in 26 February 1577/8 (f 29v), is probably an
              Italianized version of 'Johnson,' and possibly an early reference to the <rs
                ref="eats:34508" type="Entertainer_Type">lutenist</rs>
              <rs ref="eats:318436" type="Person_StatusOther">John Johnson</rs> (d. 1594), who was
              appointed a court lutenist in 1580 (Charles Edward McGuire and Jan W.J. Burgers (rev),
              'Johnson, John (i),’ <title>GMO</title>, accessed 30 August 2021; Matthew Spring,
                <title>The Lute in Britain: A History of the Instrument and Its Music</title>
              (Oxford, 2001), 103, 107; Gallagher, ‘Italian London,' p 103). <rs ref="eats:317516"
                type="Person_Nobility">North</rs> records payments to Johnson for lute lessons and
              for repairs to his <rs ref="eats:71682" type="Thing_MusicalInstrument">lutes</rs> from
              February 1577/8 and subsequently through the year.</p>

            <p>Since no payment is included here on f 29v, the entry may be to aid the calculation
              of future payments, or to record an event that North found noteworthy. The entry is
              marked with two crosses (one above, and one below), suggesting that it describes an
              event of some importance to North, a system also used in later entries marking lessons
              with Johnson.</p>

            <p> The boy <rs ref="eats:18451" type="Entertainer_Type">dancing</rs> teacher (f 29v) is
              not named; a boy, possibly the same person, is paid 2s again for dancing lessons on 11
              March (f 30).</p>


            <p> The uncle North refers to on f 30v is likely to be Sir Thomas North (1535–<hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1603),
              translator of Plutarch's <title>Lives</title> (from Jacques Amyot's French
              translation), as well as other works in Spanish and Italian. North spent quite a lot
              of time with his uncle, who appears several times in the accounts; they shared
              interests in Italian and French and possibly also in music. </p>

            <p> The dancing teacher (f 32) might be <rs ref="eats:318532" type="Person_StatusOther"
                >Sprignal the barber</rs>, to whom North paid 7s on 20 February for country dances
              and galliards, or the boy to whom North paid 2s on 5 March and 11 March for dancing
              lessons (see ff 28v, 29v, 30, 31), or another unnamed person. </p>

            <p>North records that he attended ‘commedie,’ here translated as <rs ref="eats:40453" type="Drama_Type">‘plays,’</rs> several times
              in London. The Italian word ‘commedia’ can be translated as ‘play’ and also (more
              specifically) as ‘comedy.' This translation prefers the word ‘play’ to ‘comedy’
              because in these instances it is not clear that the word means ‘comedy’ in particular,
              and because North refers to the <rs ref="eats:44753" type="Person_Male">Earl of Leicester</rs>’s <rs ref="eats:48635" type="Collective_Troupe">players</rs> as ‘commedianti’ (f 45r),
              which suggests that he understood ‘comedia’ to mean ‘play’ as much as ‘comedy.’</p>

            <p> North's father (f 45) is <rs ref="eats:151365" type="Person_Nobility">Roger
                North</rs> (1531–1600), second Baron North, who was the dominant power in later
              sixteenth-century Cambridgeshire, and lord lieutenant from 1569. Roger North purchased
              the house and estate of Mildenhall in Suffolk in 1577. Other members of North's
              retinue at Mildenhall during this trip included 'il caualliero Hynde,' 'the knight
              Hynde,' possibly Sir Francis Hynde (d. 1595/6) of Madingley, Cambridgeshire, one of
              Baron North's deputy lieutenants for Cambridgeshire, and a 'S<ex>igno</ex>r Carlo
              Worlich.' </p>

            <p>The ‘cousin <rs ref="eats:328733" type="Person_StatusOther">Thornton</rs>’ (f 45) that North visited in Soham in November is likely to
              have been a member of the family of that name associated with the village since the
              early fifteenth century. In the 1580s John Thornton was bailiff of the manor of Soham
              and maintained a substantial house (<title>VCH: Cambridgeshire</title>, vol 10,

              a fool-lackey, sometimes called 'lackey,' who is sometimes lumped with other lackeys.

              <ab>Edward Brigstocke. A presentment is made <hi rend="italic">(English)</hi> The said
                Brigstocke, seeing that he did not appear, was cited in person to respond to the
                aforesaid detection. The suspension remains in place, and on 4 June 1608, he was
                excommunicated. (A writ of excommunication) has been issued. And the aforesaid three
                excommunications were announced in church there at the time of divine service on
                Sunday, 21 July 1608 by Master Clement Martin, clerk, procurator there, as it
                appears. And <note type="marginal" place="margin_left">+</note> on 18 March 1608
                before Master Doctor Gager, principal official of the consistory court of Ely in the
                inner office of John Smith, notary, set and situated within the parish of the Holy
                Sepulchre in the town of Cambridge<note type="marginal" place="margin_left">paid

                (the holy gospels) to obey the law and adhere to the commands of the church, etc.
                Then when he was charged with the aforesaid article, the same Brigstocke confessed
                that the same (article) was in a certain way true, wherefore the lord (judge)
                pronounced him to have incurred the penalty of the statute set out in that part in
                the fourth year (of the reign) of Edward VI, the fourth chapter, etc, namely,
                suspension from entering church. And, thereafter, at the petition of the same
                Brigstocke – by the intercession of Master Welbye – the lord (judge) absolved the
                said Brigstocke, etc, when he had taken a corporal oath by touching (the holy
                gospels). And so the lord (judge) dismissed the same Brigstocke with a solemn
                warning, etc./</ab>

              <ab>Edward Towe of Wisbech St Peter. A presentment is made as above. He is to be

                at Wisbech. And on 25 August 1608, with the citation having been shown by William
                Olecorn, apparitor, the said Towe was cited. And having been summoned, he did not
                appear. He is suspended. (A writ of suspension) was issued. <hi rend="italic"

        <head>Service at the Installation of John Morton, Bishop of Ely</head>
        <div>
          <p><rs ref="eats:304598" type="Person_Nobility">John Morton</rs> was born in Dorset
              <ex>c</ex> 1410 and died at Knowles, Kent, 15 September 1500, aged about 90. He was
            educated at Oxford, and became a doctor of civil law and principal of the civil-law
            school in 1452. He was elevated to the <rs ref="eats:214531" type="Place_EA_Diocese"
              >bishopric of Ely</rs> on 30 October 1478 (installed in 1479), and then to the
            archbishopric of Canterbury on 6 October 1486, having been appointed chancellor of
            England in March of that year. This movement into the heights of royal service began on
            26 September 1456, when he became chancellor to <rs ref="eats:292705"
              type="Person_Royalty">Edward</rs>, prince of Wales, and was thus drawn into the
            political crises in England in the period. Politically, Morton struck a balance between
            Yorkist and Lancastrian partisanship, but not without severe setbacks at times. </p>
          <p> Morton was involved in drafting the bill of attainder against <rs ref="eats:125191"
              type="Person_Nobility">Richard, duke of York</rs> in 1459, and was present with the
            Lancastrians at the Second Battle of St Albans on 17 February 1460/1. Morton was
            excluded from the general pardon of Lancastrians in 1461, and fled to the continent and
            the court of <rs ref="eats:178796" type="Person_Royalty">Queen Margaret</rs>, where he
            was appointed keeper of the Privy Seal. He remained in France for most of the next
            decade, matriculating in theology at the University of Louvain in 1469, and only
            receiving a pardon by <rs ref="eats:44278" type="Person_Royalty">Edward IV</rs> in 1471
            after the short-lived readeption of <rs ref="eats:44444" type="Person_Male">Henry
              VI</rs>. Soon after the pardon, however, Edward named Morton master of the Rolls, a
            position he occupied 1472–9, ambassador to France in 1477, and finally appointed him
            bishop of Ely in 1478 (consecrated 1479). Soon after his installation at Ely, however,
            Morton joined (and possibly engineered) <rs ref="eats:163483" type="Person_Nobility"
              >Henry Stafford</rs>, duke of Buckingham's rebellion against <rs ref="eats:162135"
              type="Person_Royalty">Richard III</rs> in 1483. He was arrested in the same year and
            escaped to Flanders, returning once again from exile at the accession of <rs
              ref="eats:23807" type="Person_Male">Henry VII</rs>. Royal support for Morton then
            returned, with Henry VII seeing Morton's elevation to archbishop of Canterbury in 1486
            and naming him lord chancellor in 1486 (<title>Alumni Oxonienses 1500–1714 </title>

            archbishop of Canterbury' <title>ODNB</title>, accessed 20 September 2021). </p>
          <p> The 1479 feast at Morton's elevation to bishop of Ely, however, shows that even under
              <rs ref="eats:44278" type="Person_Royalty">Edward IV</rs> suspicions of disloyalty
            were not entirely forgotten. The guests included both churchmen and nobles. The <rs
              ref="eats:40978" type="Thing_FoodDrink">food</rs> choices provide three courses of
            both meat and fish dishes to respect the lay and ecclesiastical guests, but transition
            slowly from almost wholly meat (secular) to fish (spiritual). The herald's menu also
            describes a series of six <rs ref="eats:327338" type="Thing_Property">subtleties</rs>
            (small models or images presented with a poem), presented, two for each course, with an
            accompanying verse. The subtleties reflect a similar transition: the first is a white
            lion (an emblem from Edward IV's coat of arms), and the accompanying poem references
            'the habundant grace / Of king Edward in al his actes wise.' The sixth is the church
            itself, in <rs ref="eats:328016" type="Thing_ClothingMaterials">brass</rs>, accompanied
            by a poem to welcome all of high and low degree therein, and to invite them to yield to
            God. </p>
          <p> As Anne Brannen notes the food, the subtleties, the poems, and guests all create a
            program expressing Edward's magnanimity, but also his watchfulness. A participant was to
            understand that the king 'could forgive true repentance, and reward excellence'; within
            'a well-knit society, well-governed and impervious to, though aware of the possibilities
            of, rebellion' ('Subtleties,' pp 2–3). </p>
          <p> Thus this feast, though a very different sort of performance, contains a double
            message: turn away from the corrupting influence of the world to reject sin, and seek
            reward through both secular and spiritual loyalty and steadfastness. </p>
