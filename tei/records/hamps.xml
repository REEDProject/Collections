      <projectDesc>
        <p>Records of Early English Drama (REED) is an international scholarly project that is
          establishing for the first time the context from which the drama of Shakespeare and his
          contemporaries grew. Founded in 1976, REED has worked since then to locate, transcribe,
          and edit historical documents containing evidence of drama, secular music, and other
          communal entertainment and ceremony from the Middle Ages until 1642, when the Puritans
          closed the London theatres.</p>

        <head>Acknowledgments</head>
        <div>
          <p>Every REED edition is a collaboration and I want to begin by thanking my number one collaborator, my co-editor and great friend, Jane Cowling. We worked together on and off on this project for a quarter century, and I very much regret that she did not live to participate in its final completion and publication on REED Online.  Jane and I did not know each other at the beginning of the project, but Jane welcomed me into her home in Titchfield, helped me find my own place to live, and introduced me to Hampshire and to the local scholarly community. We divided up the editorial work by locality: Jane worked on the city of Winchester, Winchester College, Portsmouth, and the Isle of Wight; I took Southampton and the rest of the county. Jane did all the searching for records, transcribing and much of the editing for the locations she chose. She wrote the introductory material for the Winchester College records, and the rest of the introductions and apparatus incorporate much that she wrote, especially for Winchester and the Isle of Wight. Although we worked independently much of the time, we met often when I was in England to share our findings and work out knotty problems — usually in the evening, over ‘a glass of something’ (as Jane would put it, pulling out a bottle acquired on her most recent trip to France). I miss her greatly and want to dedicate this finished Hampshire edition to her memory.</p>
          
          <p>This edition would not have been possible without financial support from a number of sources.  I received several travel grants from the University of Puget Sound, as well as from the National Endowment for the Humanities. Both Jane and I received fellowships from the Hartley Library at the University of Southampton, and Jane also received support from the British Academy. The work of REED’s central editorial office has been supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Social Science and Research Council of Canada, and Father Edward Jackman and the Jackman Foundation of Toronto. We are both extremely grateful to these funders for their generosity.</p>
          
          <p>The records in this collection come from a number of archives: the Hampshire Record Office, the Winchester College Archives, the Southampton City Archives, the Isle of Wight Record Office, The National Archives, the British Library, the Surrey History Centre, the Portsmouth City Museum and Records Office, the Winchester Cathedral Library, the Salisbury Cathedral Archives, the Bodleian Library, and the archives of Corpus Christi College, Oxford. We wish to thank all these repositories for the permission to publish excerpts from their holdings. We also wish to thank Mr John Jervoise for permission to study and publish records from the wonderfully rich Jervoise of Herriard Collection deposited at the Hampshire Record Office, and Ms Fanny Oglander for permission to publish excerpts from the writing of her ancestor, Sir John Oglander, on deposit at the Isle of Wight Record Office.</p>
            
            <p>We wish to thank all the staff of these archives for their patient assistance over the thirty years it has taken to produce this edition. REED editors are literary archaeologists, and we have had to scrape away a good deal of dirt to find the occasional shard that can add to our history of early drama. We owe much to the people who, day after day, have brought us bucketloads of documents, taken them away again, cared for the documents in the meantime, and sometimes helped us to tell shard from dirt. In particular we wish to thank, at the Hampshire Record Office, Gill Rushton, Caroline Humphries, David Rymill, and especially Sarah Lewin, who helped us launch our research at the beginning and many years later helped us pull it together in our Hampshire Paper. Roger Custance and Suzanne Foster aided our researches at Winchester College, as did Sue Woolgar and Andrew George at the Southampton City Archives, John Hardacre at Winchester Cathedral Library, and Julian Reid at Corpus Christi College, Oxford. Chris Woolgar of the University of Southampton advised us on research, administered our Hartley Fellowships, and generously shared the early kingale record of Andover he discovered buried in coroners’ reports at The National Archives.</p>
            
            <p>We also want to express our gratitude to a number of other scholars who have helped us along the way.  Tom James of the University of Winchester shared preliminary research he had done on dramatic records of Southampton and provided helpful suggestions for our Hampshire Paper. Ernest Blake of the University of Southampton checked translations of some difficult Latin records included in Jane’s doctoral thesis. Martin Wiggins of the Shakespeare Institute made a number of helpful suggestions about records of Sir Richard Paulet and also directed our attention to an unpublished play connected to Winchester College. Robert Tittler provided historical perspective throughout the project and read an early draft of the historical introduction. James Gibson checked on some Hampshire records in the Kent archives, and allowed us to reprint in this Hampshire collection his editing (for REED Kent, Diocese of Canterbury) of the Visitatio Sepulchri from the Regularis Concordia and the Winchester Troper. Others who have contributed useful suggestions and references include Ed Cueva, David Lupher, Bill Cooke, Richard Rastall, Cheryl Burke, David Freemantle, Lynn Forest-Hill, and the anonymous reviewers of the proofs of this project. Our especial thanks go to John McGavin of the University of Southampton, who was a great mentor to Jane as supervisor of her doctoral thesis and who has encouraged and supported both of us through the long life of this project.</p>
            
            <p>The staff of the REED Office at the University of Toronto has contributed immeasurably to this project. Patrick Gregory did paleographical checking of the transcriptions and provided most of the Latin translation. Kathy Chung did the indexing, tagging the entities to make the records searchable. Tanya Hagen checked the bibliographic references in the apparatus and provided leads to new records. The meticulous work of those three not only ensured the accuracy of the records and apparatus, but also, by turning fresh and perceptive eyes on material that had become over-familiar to me, they pushed me to add fuller explanations of the records to the apparatus and to see connections in the evidence I had not previously noticed. Early in the research process we had bibliographical support from Theodore de Welles and Miriam Skey, and Abigail Ann Young helped Jane with the Latin of some of the Winchester College documents.</p>
            
            <p>Paleographical checking of documents at archives in the UK was done by Stephanie Hovland, aided by Merel Veldhuizen, Alan Nelson, and Sally-Beth MacLean. In Toronto, a number of research assistants contributed to the project: Alexandra Atiya worked on bibliographic support, Janine Harper on the English glossary, Cai Henderson on Latin paleography and translation, Jané Jacobs on mapping, and Morgan Moore on patrons research. Carolyn Black provided overall management for the project, coordinating the work of this whole REED team, as well as doing proofreading and coding. Jamie Norrish is the programmer and developer for the REED Online platform.</p>
            
            <p>Jane and I want to thank Alexandra Johnston, founder of Records of Early English Drama, and Sally-Beth MacLean, Director of Research and General Editor, for their trust and support throughout the life of this project. They took both of us on when we were only graduate students, and through the following decades Sandy and Sally-Beth have been mentors, valued research colleagues, and dear friends.</p>
          
          <p>Finally, I want to thank my children, Dinah and Toby, who endured (and perhaps even enjoyed) having significant portions of their childhoods dislocated to Hampshire. My wife, Sandra Dahlberg, accompanied me on research trips, put aside her own research at times to help me by combing through catalogues and photographing manuscripts, and listened patiently to my soliloquies on matters often of interest only to REED editors. Her companionship and enthusiasm have been crucial to keeping me going over the many years it has taken to bring the Hampshire records to publication.</p>

          <p><rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1967/" type="Place_County">Hampshire</rs> was the heart of King Alfred’s Wessex and would later become known as the birthplace of both cricket and Jane Austen, as well as the launching place of the <hi rend="italic">Mary Rose</hi>, the American Pilgrims, the <hi rend="italic">Titanic</hi>, and the D-Day invasion. Yet it may be Gilbert White’s <title>Natural History of Selborne</title> and Keats' 'To Autumn' – inspired by an evening walk along the River Itchen – that best convey the character of the county. Hampshire is among the largest English counties by area and today is one of the most populous, due to the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/36947/" type="Place_BoroughParish">London</rs> commuter belt encroaching into the county’s northeast corner and development expanding along the south coast between <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/87185/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Portsmouth</rs> and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/72712/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Southampton</rs>. Even so, much of the county is still considered rural. In the medieval and early modern periods Hampshire was thinly populated and relatively poor. <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/79157/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Winchester</rs> with its royal associations and Southampton with its port dominated the county from the time of the Domesday Survey until Portsmouth began to gain in population and importance in the seventeenth century. Winchester and Southampton dominate the county’s history of dramatic activity as well, but several towns and rural parishes contribute to that history, as do some of the county’s aristocratic families.<note type="foot">R.S. Schofield ranks Hampshire only in the mid- to low twenties of England’s thirty-eight counties in the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries. See Table 2 in ‘The Geographical Distribution of Wealth in England, 1334–1649,’ <title>The Economic History Review</title>, ns, 18.3 (1965), 504.</note></p>
            <p>Hampshire formed a significant part of the Saxon kingdom of Wessex from the seventh century until the Norman Conquest, and Winchester effectively became the kingdom’s capital after Alfred defeated the Danes in 878.<note type="foot">Barry Cunliffe, <title>Wessex to AD 1000</title>, A Regional History of England (London and New York, 2003), 298–302, 323.</note> After the Conquest the Normans quickly established a castle and a royal treasury at Winchester, symbolically taking over the Saxon royal city.  They reinforced the Roman and Saxon fort at Portchester and constructed other castles at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/122577/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Christchurch</rs> and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/107462/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Bishops Waltham</rs>, at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/124131/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Carisbrooke</rs> on the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/2363/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Isle of Wight</rs>, and at Southampton, the last especially to protect the sea link between England and Normandy. The Norman and Angevin kings came frequently to the county, not only for the Easter court at Winchester instituted by <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/194957/" type="Person_Royalty">William I</rs> but also to Portchester and to the hunting lodges at Warnford and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/106784/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Romsey</rs>. <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/219842/" type="Person_Royalty">King William Rufus</rs> was famously killed in 1087 while hunting in New Forest and was buried at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/107876/" type="Place_Feature">Winchester Cathedral</rs>.<note type="foot">Bettey, <title>Wessex from AD 1000</title>, pp 13–14, 26–7.</note></p>
          <p>This close relationship between Winchester and the Crown had already waned by the beginning of the twelfth century, but the city continued to have a royal connection, as well as being the seat of the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/154663/" type="Collective_Office">bishops of Winchester</rs>, many of whom played a significant part in national politics, from <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/179703/" type="Person_Clergy">Henry of Blois</rs> in the twelfth century to <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/108222/" type="Person_Clergy">Henry Beaufort</rs> in the fifteenth and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/139370/" type="Person_Clergy">Stephen Gardiner</rs> in the sixteenth.<note type="foot">Keene and Rumble, <title>Medieval Winchester</title>, vol 2, pts 2–3, pp 294–5.</note> The annual <rs ref="https://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/43457/ https://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/111361/" type="Entertainment_Type">St Giles’ Fair</rs> at the beginning of September was one of the most important fairs in England in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, bringing traders from the Continent as well as from all over England.<note type="foot">St Giles’ Day is 1 September. William Rufus granted Winchester a fair lasting from the vigil through the morrow of St Giles’ Day and by the twelfth century it had been extended to sixteen days and occasionally twenty-four (<title>VCH: Hampshire</title>, vol 5, pp 36–44, <title>British History Online</title>, https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/hants/vol5/pp36-44 [accessed 12 April 2019]).</note> Southampton was the major port for overseas trade, for Wessex in the Saxon period and then for London and the rest of southern England after the Conquest. The Norman kings travelled back and forth between England and Normandy through Southampton. Wool and other needs of the cloth industry moved from Hampshire and the surrounding counties across the channel, traded for imports from Italy, Spain, and Flanders: wine, dyestuffs, spices, and luxury goods went by cart from Southampton to London, and as far north as <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/123250/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Gloucester</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/37701/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Coventry</rs>, and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/35893/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Leicester</rs>. In the mid-fifteenth century an estimated 1,600 carts passed through Southampton’s gates each year.<note type="foot"> Bettey, <title>Wessex from AD 1000</title>, pp 50, 118–19; Farmer, 'Marketing the Produce,' p
              352.</note></p>
            <p>Three kinds of topography dominate the Hampshire landscape: chalk downlands, low-lying river basins, and the sea coast. On the east side of the county the South Downs rise just north of Portsmouth and continue north to the area around <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/79210/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Alton</rs>, where they angle northwest along the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1751/" type="Place_County">Berkshire</rs> border. On the west side of the county lower hills separate the Test watershed from that of the Salisbury Avon in Wiltshire. In the southwestern corner of the county the hills disappear and the low-lying New Forest blends into the lower part of the Avon watershed. In between, the Hampshire Basin spreads south of the downlands in the centre of the county, created by the rivers that drain the downs – the Test, Itchen, Meon, and their tributaries. The coast provides excellent harbours at Portsmouth and Southampton, where the inlets of Portsmouth Harbour and Southampton Water are further protected from the worst weather by the Isle of Wight. The Isle itself mirrors the topography of the Hampshire mainland, as the northern part is low-lying clay and gravel soil while the southern part is hilly and more fertile. The fertile, well-drained areas of the county – along the Test, Itchen, and Meon rivers, and the hilly southern part of the Isle of Wight – were much more populous and prosperous than areas with unfavourable conditions – the acid soil of the New Forest, the higher chalk downlands, and the northern part of the Isle of Wight.<note type="foot"> Bettey, <title>Wessex from AD 1000</title>, pp 3, 20–1; Keene and Rumble, <title>Medieval Winchester</title>, vol 1, pt 1, p 42.</note></p>
              <p>Careful farming used the thin soil of the chalk downlands on the land along the stream beds. 
                Sheep were pastured on the hills during the day, then brought down to folds near the streams at night.

                  <p>The great estates owned by the bishop of Winchester and by the county’s monasteries led to a great expansion in farming to meet the needs of a population that increased steadily from the Conquest through the thirteenth century. Woodlands, marsh, and waste land were cleared to bring more land under cultivation and new urban centres sprang up with new markets and fairs. The Domesday boroughs of Winchester, Southampton, and Portchester were joined by a number of places that had markets and some elements of borough organization, including <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/107246/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Alresford</rs>, Alton, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/86811/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Andover</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/123118/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Basingstoke</rs>, Christchurch, Fareham, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/123272/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Lymington</rs>, Overton, Petersfield, Portsmouth, Ringwood, Romsey, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/107528/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Stockbridge</rs>, and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/124626/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Whitchurch</rs>, and on the Isle of Wight, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/87076/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Newport</rs> and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/124362/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Yarmouth</rs>.

                  <p>The period of expansion came to an end even before the Black Death. Although the woollen industry flourished and some individuals amassed considerable wealth, in general the fourteenth century was a period of economic decline.<note type="foot">Farmer, 'Marketing the Produce,' pp 345–6.</note> The population had grown to the point where the land could sustain those living on it only in favourable years and poor harvests had a devastating effect.<note type="foot">'On the estates of the Bishops of Winchester up to a third of the men were landless, and the average holding per family less than 2 acres. . . .  Such people were obviously living dangerously close to subsistence level and rapidly succumbed to poor harvests, famine and disease’ (Bettey, <title>Wessex from AD 1000</title>, p 83).</note> Bad weather and poor harvests in 1315–17 led to wheat prices tripling, followed by plagues among the sheep and cattle. The Black Death arrived in 1348 and 1349 and Hampshire suffered as badly as any county in England. Almost half of the clergy of Winchester diocese died from plague. On the manor of Bishops Waltham 264 tenants died in 1348–9 out of a total of 404 and another fifty-three died when the plague struck again in 1361. Titchfield Abbey’s estates saw 305 of 515 tenants die in 1348–9 and another ninety-two in 1361.<note type="foot">Bettey, <title>Wessex from AD 1000</title>, pp 82–5, 88.</note></p>
                  <p>As elsewhere, the heavy mortality led to the end of customary labour by tenants and a rise in labour costs as individuals sold their labour. Individuals could rise from bondmen in the fourteenth century to yeomen by the sixteenth. At the same time, the much reduced population needed less grain and the combination substantially reduced profits from arable farming. Higher prices for wool led to a substantial increase in sheep farming and the shifting of much land from arable to sheep pasture until wool prices fell in the late 1370s.<note type="foot">Edward Miller, 'The Occupation of the Land: The Southern Counties,' <title>The Agrarian History of England and Wales, vol 3: 1348–1500</title> (Cambridge and New York, 1991),  138–9, 143–4; Bettey, <title>Wessex from AD 1000</title>, pp 107–10.</note> Jack Cade’s 1450 rebellion spread to Hampshire, especially among cloth workers suffering from a steep decline in English exports of cloth at the time.<note type="foot">E.B.

                  <p>Cloth production, which had been centred in Winchester before the fourteenth century, spread to rural areas where water-powered fulling mills could be built along fast-flowing streams. By the sixteenth century cloth-making had become important in Alton, Alresford, Andover, Basingstoke, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/86966/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Fordingbridge</rs>, Petersfield, Romsey, and Whitchurch, as well as Winchester, and even Southampton became involved in cloth-making to compensate for the decline of its port. Andover, Basingstoke, and Ringwood became regional market centres, especially for trade in cattle and sheep, cheese, and grain. Alton developed a weekly cattle market and Alresford a sheep market.<note type="foot">Bettey, <title>Wessex from AD 1000</title>, pp 138, 142–4, 146; John Patten, <title>English Towns 1500–1700</title>, Studies in Historical Geography (Folkestone, Kent, and Hamden, CT, 1978), 169.</note> By the seventeenth century the clear streams also came to be used to provide both water and power to produce paper; the process could also utilize remnants of the county’s sea trade, such as sail cloth and rope, mixed into the wood pulp.<note type="foot">Bettey, <title>Wessex to AD 1000</title>, p 141.</note> On the other hand, new approaches to agriculture that were improving farming in other counties in the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries did not catch on in Hampshire until after the Civil War. Hampshire remained a thinly populated county: its population density was thirty-five per cent lower than <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/2129/" type="Place_County">Norfolk</rs>'s and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/2273/" type="Place_County">Suffolk</rs>'s in 1603, with the total number of communicants in the county estimated at only a little over 50,000.  Winchester and Southampton remained the largest towns, the only ones in the county with populations over 2,000. Romsey, Christchurch, Ringwood, Newport (Isle of Wight), and Basingstoke had between 1,500 and 2,000 inhabitants, while <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/107224/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Kingsclere</rs>, Andover, Fordingbridge, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/107506/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Titchfield</rs>, and Alton had between 1,000 and 1,500.<note type="foot">Adrienne Rosen, ‘Winchester in Transition, 1580–1700,' <title>Country Towns in Pre-Industrial England</title>, Peter Clark (ed), Themes in Urban History (Leicester and New York, 1981), 154, 174–5; Peter Clark and Jean Hosking, <title>Population Estimates of Small English Towns</title>, Centre for Urban History, University of Leicester, Working Paper no 5 (Leicester, 1989; rev ed, 1993), 61–5, 75.

                  <p>Winchester’s economic decline had begun with the Crown’s withdrawal in the twelfth century although the bishopric and the monasteries continued to draw trade and visitors to the city. As much of the county’s wealth and population in the late Middle Ages was located in other parts of the county like the upper Test valley, the city did not function as the natural market centre of a wealthy rural area. By the sixteenth century Winchester had become a cathedral city of only regional significance.<note type="foot">Keene and Rumble, <title>Medieval Winchester</title>, vol 1, pt 1, pp 86–7.</note> Southampton’s economy flourished much longer, though it suffered for a time from the war with France in the fourteenth century and from the Black Death. The peace that followed <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/176646/" type="Person_Royalty">Henry V</rs>’s victories in the early fifteenth century brought back trade with France as well as increasing numbers of Italian merchants who traded through and even lived in Southampton.<note type="foot">Colin Platt, <title>Medieval Southampton: The Port and Trading Community, AD 1000–1600</title> (London, 1973), 109–12, 119, 153–4.</note> Wars in Italy cut into Southampton’s Mediterranean trade in the sixteenth century but the mortal blow came from improvements to navigation on the Thames that allowed London merchants to bring ships right into the capital.

          <p>Little is known about the beginnings of Christianity in Hampshire, at least at the parish level. The Saxons of the region converted in the mid-seventh century and a community of secular canons was formed at Winchester’s Old Minster in 643. In 676 Winchester became the seat of a bishopric that included the whole of Hampshire and Isle of Wight as well as Surrey (and Sussex until 711). According to the Venerable Bede, St Wilfred came from Northumbria to convert the South Saxons in the late seventh century, establishing churches in the Meon Valley and on the Isle of Wight.<note type="foot"><title>Baedae Opera Historica, vol 2: Ecclesiastical History of the English Nation</title>, J.E.

The tenth century also saw convents of Benedictine nuns appear at Nunnaminster (<hi rend="italic">c</hi> 900) in Winchester and at Romsey (<hi rend="italic">c</hi> 907), and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/106960/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Wherwell</rs> (<hi rend="italic">c</hi> 986).

          <p>Monasticism’s popularity waned to some degree in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries with few new houses founded after the Black Death, though the existing houses did continue to dominate the county with their large estates. Late medieval popular piety tended to turn from supporting the monasteries to enlarging and decorating parish churches with funds raised by parishioners themselves, especially through church ales. This period also saw founding of many chantries and charitable institutions such as hospitals, almshouses, and schools.<note type="foot">Bettey, <title>Wessex from AD 1000</title>, pp 89–93, 96–104.</note> <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/75941/" type="CrimesMisdemeanors">Lollardy</rs> appears to have had little impact in most of Hampshire, except in the northeastern corner that is within the Thames Valley.

          <p>The Reformation also developed slowly in Hampshire.

          <p>Efforts to root out the last vestiges of the old religion continued with Bishop <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/108540/" type="Person_Clergy">Thomas Cooper</rs> in the 1580s. He appealed to his parishes to desist from popish practices like church ales and May

            <p><rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/219955/" type="Person_Clergy">St Swithun</rs> was a bishop of Winchester who died in 862 and was buried in the churchyard of the Old Minster. <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/204950/" type="Person_Clergy">Bishop Aethelwold</rs> rebuilt the cathedral in 971 and had the saint’s body moved inside the church, where it was housed in a gold and silver shrine given by <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/220302/" type="Person_Royalty">King Edgar</rs> and placed behind the high altar. The Benedictine monks provided hospitality for many types of travellers: those coming to saint’s shrine and cathedral, those visiting Winchester because it was a royal city, and those taking the road to the port of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/72712/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Southampton</rs>. The number of visitors decreased from the thirteenth century on as the court visited less frequently and the road to Southampton took another route several miles east. Like other large Benedictine houses, St Swithun’s was intended to house seventy monks but rarely managed so many. In 1325 there were sixty-four but after the Black Death the numbers dropped, never again topping forty-six, and in 1495–6 they had dwindled to only twenty-nine. The priory possessed numerous manors across the county, though its holdings did not approach the huge estates of the bishops of Winchester. The <title>Valor Ecclesiasticus</title> estimated the priory’s net income in 1535 at £1,507, much the largest among Hampshire religious houses.

            <p>St Cross Hospital is famous today for the Wayfarers’ Dole of bread and ale, provided to any visitor who asks, and for being the model for the almshouse in Trollope’s <title>The Warden</title>. Located a mile south of the centre of Winchester, St Cross was founded in 1136 by Bishop Henry of Blois and is the oldest and largest almshouse in England. The original foundation was to provide food and living quarters for thirteen poor men and also food for a hundred poor people who would come at dinner time. A second group of almsmen was endowed in 1446 by Cardinal Beaufort, increasing the number to twenty-five, and the structures were enlarged at the same time. The endowment also provided for a master, a steward, four chaplains, and choristers. The buildings include the church and a quadrangle of living quarters, great hall, kitchen, and infirmary.<note type="foot"><title>VCH: Hampshire</title>, vol 2, pp 193–7, <title>British History Online</title>, https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/hants/vol2/pp193-197 [accessed 23 April 2019]; <title>VCH: Hampshire</title>, vol 5, pp 59–69, <title>British History Online</title>, https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/hants/vol5/pp59-69 [accessed 23 April 2019].</note></p>

            <p>The Augustinian priory of St Denys was founded by Henry I around 1124. It was located two miles north of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/72712/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Southampton</rs>’s north gate in Portswood on the approximate site of St Denys' rail station (which is now well within the bounds of the city of Southampton). St Denys' was given all the chapels within the town, with the exception of St John’s, and the priory also acquired other churches and estates in the region. In 1535 the house had a prior and nine canons, but the numbers may have been greater in the fifteenth century, as the staff that served the canons was only five in 1536 but had been eight in 1426. The <title>Valor Ecclesiasticus</title> put the annual value of the priory’s lands at only £32 15s, making it one of the poorer religious houses that were dissolved in 1536. The royal commissioners recorded that the church and other buildings were in very poor repair.<note type="foot">J.B.

          <p>Winchester and Southampton dominated both the county’s economy and its cultural life from before the Conquest to the seventeenth century. Moreover, both towns have well-preserved archives of civic records that do not exist to document life in the smaller towns and villages. For those reasons it is perhaps unsurprising that some relatively important medieval towns get very little mention in this collection, among them Basingstoke, Christchurch, Fordingbridge, Ringwood, and Romsey. Of these only Basingstoke lay on a major road likely to be used by itinerant performers, which may partially explain the lack of dramatic records, but the vagaries of manuscript survival are no doubt responsible for the fact that we know little about those towns yet a good deal about entertainment activity at Andover and even at rather obscure villages like <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/86922/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Bramley</rs> and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/87318/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Wootton St Lawrence</rs>.</p>

            <p>The earliest dramatic records from Winchester date from the fourteenth century, after the city’s glory years under King Alfred and the early Norman monarchs, but the late medieval and early modern city inherited much from its earlier history, in particular its physical layout. Winchester lies on the west bank of the River Itchen where an ancient east-west route crossed the river. The river valley is narrow at Winchester, the Hampshire chalk downs rising on either side. The eastern half of the city, from the Itchen to west of the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/107876/" type="Place_Feature">cathedral</rs>, lies on relatively flat river bottom. The land then slopes up significantly to the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/155613/" type="Place_Feature">castle</rs> and West Gate. On the east bank of the Itchen the ground rises rapidly to the crest of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/111361/" type="Place_Feature">St Giles' Hill</rs>. The city walls define a roughly rectangular space approximately twice as wide east to west as north to south and the streets follow the characteristic Roman grid pattern. The High Street follows the line of the old east-west route, the other main streets crossing it at right angles.<note type="foot">Keene and Rumble, <title>Medieval Winchester</title>, vol 1, pt 1, pp 42, 48; <title>VCH: Hampshire</title>, vol 5, pp 1–9, <title>British History Online</title>, https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/hants/vol5/pp1-9 [accessed 28 April 2019].</note> Through the East Gate ran a road that eventually turned northeast through Alresford and Alton to reach <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/36947/" type="Place_BoroughParish">London</rs>, while the road out the West Gate led to <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/71901/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Salisbury</rs> and Exeter. A road north linked Winchester with the Midlands, running through Newbury and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/39267/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Oxford</rs> at least as far as Northampton. The road from the South Gate led to <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/72712/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Southampton</rs>, providing the main means of moving goods to the port rather than on the shallow Itchen.<note type="foot">F.M.

              <p>Iron Age hill forts have been excavated in the Winchester area, at St Catherine’s Hill and Worthy Down, and at Oram’s Arbour just west of the modern rail station. In the late first century CE the Romans made Winchester a regional garrison and constructed the walls that gave the medieval city its basic rectangular shape.<note type="foot">Keene and Rumble, <title>Medieval Winchester</title>, vol 1, pt 1, pp 42–3.</note> The walls survived to protect the royal and episcopal community of the Saxon period and in the 880s King Alfred substantially rebuilt the city as one of his 'burhs' that provided defenses against the Danes. The community of secular canons established at Old Minster in 643 was replaced by a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/107330/" type="Place_ReligiousHouse">priory</rs> of Benedictine monks dedicated to St Swithun and the minster enlarged. The Roman walls were refurbished and new streets laid out, with only the central High Street and the gateways remaining, while the rest was newly divided and almost nine kilometres of new road created, using eight thousand tons of cobbles. The royal palace was originally located in the centre of the city just west of Old Minster. Shortly after 900 New Minster was built just to the north of Old Minster and Nunnaminster (later St Mary’s Abbey) built for nuns to its east. In the second half of the tenth century building works added considerably to the physical extent of the monasteries and the shrine of St Swithun brought pilgrims to the city.<note type="foot"><title>VCH: Hampshire</title>, vol 2, pp 108–115, 122–6, <title>British History Online</title>, https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/hants/vol2/pp108-115, https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/hants/vol2/pp122-126 [accessed 29 April 2019]; Martin Biddle (ed), <title>Winchester in the Early Middle Ages: An Edition and Discussion of the Winton Domesday</title>, Winchester Studies 1 (Oxford, 1976), 449–54, 461, 465–7; Nicholas J.

              <p>At the time of the Conquest Winchester ranked fourth among English towns, behind London, York, and probably Norwich, and was similar to Lincoln in size and wealth, these five towns standing out above the rest of the country.<note type="foot">Martin Biddle (ed), <title>Winchester in the Early Middle Ages: An Edition and Discussion of the Winton Domesday</title>, Winchester Studies 1 (Oxford, 1976),  468–9.</note> William made the city the seat of the early Norman kings, where he annually wore the crown at Easter and where he established the royal treasury.<note type="foot">Bettey, <title>Wessex from AD 1000</title>, p 26.</note> Within a few months of the Conquest an extensive construction program began throughout the city. The royal palace in the middle of the city was doubled in size and a new castle built in the southwestern corner of the walls. The bishop’s palace at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/107136/" type="Place_Feature">Wolvesey</rs> was rebuilt and enlarged, as was Nunnaminster, which was renamed St Mary’s Abbey.<note type="foot"><title>VCH: Hampshire</title>, vol 2, pp 122–6, <title>British History Online</title>, https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/hants/vol2/pp122-126 [accessed 29 April 2019].</note> A new, much larger Norman Cathedral was started just north of Old Minster and the New Minster community moved to Hyde Abbey, built just outside the North Gate. Henry I greatly enlarged the new castle near the West Gate, preferring it to the old royal palace in the centre of the city, which was burned and then demolished in the 1140s. The ten or eleven parish churches that had existed in Winchester before the Conquest grew to fifty-seven by the mid-twelfth century.<note type="foot">Martin Biddle (ed), <title>Winchester in the Early Middle Ages: An Edition and Discussion of the Winton Domesday</title>, Winchester Studies 1 (Oxford, 1976),  470–3, 486.</note></p>
              <p>All this growth in wealth and population was short-lived, however. The relationship between Winchester and the monarchy weakened under Henry I, who ended the custom of Easter crown-wearing at Winchester. The civil war between <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/220477/" type="Person_Royalty">Stephen</rs> and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/220542/" type="Person_Royalty">Matilda</rs> further strained the relationship, especially after the siege of Winchester in 1141 that resulted in the burning of the royal palace. The royal treasury remained at Winchester for a few more decades but most royal administration left Winchester for London. <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/220613/" type="Person_Royalty">Richard I</rs> would return to Winchester to be re-crowned on his return from Crusades but the king had become less important in Winchester, while the bishop became dominant. Stephen’s brother, Bishop Henry of Blois, continued some of the building, founding <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/106916/" type="Place_Feature">St Cross Hospital</rs> and serving as patron to the artistic explosion at Winchester in the second half of the twelfth century that included creation of the Winchester Bible. When the king was absent from Winchester the bishop took charge, so the ecclesiastical community continued to exert considerable influence over the secular part of the city, even after the entire southeastern quadrant of the city, enclosing the three minsters and the bishop’s palace, had been walled off as a religious precinct. Influential bishops like Henry of Blois and later Henry, Cardinal Beaufort, and Stephen Gardiner kept Winchester from entirely losing significance on the national stage.<note type="foot">Bettey, <title>Wessex from AD 1000</title>, p 31; Martin Biddle (ed), <title>Winchester in the Early Middle Ages: An Edition and Discussion of the Winton Domesday</title>, Winchester Studies 1 (Oxford, 1976), 465, 489–92.</note></p>
              <p>The bishops usually resided in Southwark but their episcopal administrative staff remained in Winchester.<note type="foot">The bishop’s palace in Southwark and considerable adjacent land in the liberty of the Clink lay close to where the Globe and Rose theatres were built.</note> Being the seat of the bishop meant that the church courts brought visitors to the town, and others came to the city on business concerning the estates of the bishop, the dean and chapter, and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/106806/" type="Place_Feature">Winchester College</rs>. Moreover, as the county town, Winchester could count on large groups of visitors coming to the county assizes and quarter sessions several times annually. The many lawyers required for all this legal business combined with the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/10928/" type="Collective_ClergyAndChurchwardens">cathedral clergy</rs> and the fellows of the college to make a substantial group of residents who were both educated and reasonably well off.<note type="foot">Adrienne Rosen, ‘Winchester in Transition, 1580–1700,' <title>Country Towns in Pre-Industrial England</title>, Peter Clark (ed), Themes in Urban History (Leicester and New York, 1981),

The bishops became the principal landowners of the growing suburban area known as the liberty of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/111630/" type="Place_BoroughParish">the Soke</rs>. The Soke was located just beyond the city walls, occupying the land between the River Itchen and St Giles’ Hill on the east and wrapping around the walls on both the north and south sides of the city. The <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1140/" type="Collective_Office">mayor</rs> and other civic officials had no jurisdiction there as the bishop held all legal authority in the Soke. After 1231 the bishop appointed a steward or <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/10976/" type="Collective_Office">bailiff</rs> to administer this area, an official at times called the ‘mayor of the Soke’ in the records.<note type="foot">Keene and Rumble, <title> Medieval Winchester</title>, vol 1, pt 1, pp 72–3.</note></p>

              <head>Civic Government and Economy</head>
              <p>Surveys taken by Henry I and Bishop Henry of Blois in the early twelfth century show the king to have been the largest landowner in Winchester at that time. Moreover, all land not occupied by buildings – meaning especially all the streets in the city – belonged to the king, so that even someone setting up a stall in the street was required to pay a fee to the king. In Saxon and early Norman times the king ruled the city through his reeves. The mayor and guild merchant appeared only at the beginning of the thirteenth century, once the Crown had withdrawn from Winchester. The charters Winchester received from Henry III in 1227 and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/30996/" type="Person_Royalty">Edward III</rs> a century later incrementally increased the city’s authority to govern itself. Yet even in the fourteenth century the city had not become independent of the king, as the mayor’s oath swears the mayor to keeping the city safe for the profit of the king and doing nothing to impair the king’s interests. Winchester thus had to develop its civic government through a series of efforts to satisfy the king’s interests through its own officers and organization rather than through officers imposed by the Crown.<note type="foot">J.S. Furley, <title>City Government of Winchester from the Records of the XIV &amp;  XV Centuries</title> (Oxford, 1923), 3, 5–7, 12–16, 20–1, 28–35.</note></p>
              <p>The later thirteenth century saw the emergence of the twenty-four and also of the commonalty or community (freemen of the city not members of the twenty-four), who participated in the election of the mayor and bailiffs. The twenty-four had an advisory function only, with no direct power to legislate or administrate, instead wielding influence by working closely with the mayor. Legislation was done at the Burghmote, which met at Michaelmas and Easter (and at least one other time) each year to elect the mayor and bailiffs and to enact other business, including (from the late thirteenth century) electing members of parliament. The Burghmote or ‘Common Convocation’ was held in the hall of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/111737/" type="Place_Feature">St John’s Hospital</rs> and theoretically comprised all the freemen of the city, though the numbers could be as small as thirteen. <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/214158/" type="Collective_GuildOccupational">Winchester’s Merchants' guild</rs> was made up mainly of those who had finished their apprenticeship and possessed £4 worth of property. Membership of the guild allowed one to buy raw materials and sell products. Unlike some other towns – notably <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/86811/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Andover</rs>, where <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/220694/" type="Collective_GuildOccupational">the Merchants' guild</rs> and city government were one and the same ¬– in Winchester the guild was quite separate from city government; its officers had no role beyond the regulation of trade among guild members and did not act as civic magistrates.<note type="foot">J.S. Furley, <title>City Government of Winchester from the Records of the XIV &amp; XV Centuries</title> (Oxford, 1923), 62–75.</note> The civic magistracy tended to come from among the wealthiest wool merchants, goldsmiths, and to a lesser extent, tailors.<note type="foot">Keene and Rumble, <title>Medieval Winchester</title>, vol 1, pt 1, pp 280–1, 294, 432.</note> The typical career of a successful Winchester man began with becoming a member of the fraternity of St John and of the guild merchant, then rising through the ranks of the guild, and culminated in moving through the three most important offices in the city: bailiff of the commons, bailiff of the twenty-four, and finally mayor.<note type="foot">Keene and Rumble, <title>Medieval Winchester</title>, vol 1, pt 1, p 428.</note></p>
              <p>A 1437 ordinance in The Black Book of Winchester lists the city’s crafts and fraternities: carpenters, tilers, smiths, cooks, butchers, cobblers, tanners, and skinners; the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/154325/" type="Collective_GuildReligious">fraternity of St John the Baptist</rs> (probably including the tailors); as well as barbers, tapeners, weavers, and mercers; a later amendment adds plumbers, glovers, chandlers, and brewers.<note type="foot">Bird, <title>Black Book</title>, pp 73–4; Keene and Rumble, <title>Medieval Winchester</title>, vol 1, pt 1, p 333.</note> The individual crafts had little formal organization compared to those of York or Chester, the merchant guild being the significant organization in civic life.<note type="foot">Keene and Rumble, <title>Medieval Winchester</title>, vol 1, pt 1, p 332.</note> Those in the victualling trades – bakers, butchers, brewers, grocers, and others – were the most numerous in Winchester, providing for the royal and ecclesiastical institutions as well as for the general populace. The next largest group was those involved in making and selling woollen cloth. Leather and iron workers, as well as goldsmiths, made luxury goods for the city’s royal and ecclesiastical residents and visitors. Clerical and legal workers inhabited the city in substantial numbers, as it remained the county town and diocesan administrative centre even after the departure of the Crown in the twelfth century and the Dissolution of the monasteries in the sixteenth.<note type="foot">Keene and Rumble, <title>Medieval Winchester</title>, vol 1, pt 1, p 251; Martin Biddle (ed), <title>Winchester in the Early Middle Ages: An Edition and Discussion of the Winton Domesday</title>, Winchester Studies 1 (Oxford, 1976), 459–60.</note></p>

              <head>Population and Wealth</head>
              <p>Derek Keene sums up Winchester’s experience in the later Middle Ages: 'In the eleventh and twelfth centuries Winchester was both a royal city and a major centre of wealth and population; by the sixteenth century it had declined to the minor regional centre and cathedral city which it has been ever since.'<note type="foot">Keene and Rumble, <title>Medieval Winchester</title>, vol 1, pt 1, p 86.</note> The records of entertainment that first appear in the 1370s thus reflect the diminution of the city’s wealth due to the Crown’s withdrawal (largely complete by 1300) as well as the impact of the Black Death. The episcopal administration and monasteries that remained were relatively self-sufficient and so brought less wealth to the city’s merchants and tradesmen than had the visits of the royal court. Having ranked fourth among English towns at the time of the Conquest and still in the top ten in the twelfth century, Winchester had slipped to fifteenth by the time of the 1334 assessment. Keene and Rumble put the  population at 11,625 around 1300, but it had shrunk to  7,750, even including the suburbs, by 1400.<note type="foot">Keene and Rumble, <title>Medieval Winchester</title>, vol 1, pt 1, pp 86–7, 90–2, 366–8. Using the 1417 tarrage survey, Keene computes an approximate population for Winchester (within the walls) at this time at 4,153, with another 2,768 living in the Soke. He also estimates that 729 lived in the city’s ecclesiastical institutions, including the cathedral, monasteries, and Winchester College. Another sixty were permanent residents of the castle and Wolvesey Palace.</note></p> 
              <p>Winchester became a major collecting point for the wool trade in southwestern England with wool being traded at St Giles’ Fair and then exported through Southampton. St Giles’ Fair, held in September, was established by a grant from King William Rufus. He set fair time as the three days surrounding the saint’s feast day on the first of September but the fair soon grew to six and then sixteen days or longer in the twelfth century. During the fair all trading was suspended within the city and the mayor led a great procession out the East Gate to St Giles’ Hill, with the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/156198/" type="Collective_Office">civic minstrels</rs> carrying the 'tron of wools,' the scale used for weighing imports into the city (so that tariffs could be assessed). In the twelfth and early thirteenth century it was one of the two or three most important fairs in England, attended by merchants from London, York, Lincoln, and other prominent English towns, as well as traders from Spain, France, and the Low Countries. By the mid-thirteenth century the fair had hit its high point and its decline accelerated in the fourteenth century as Winchester lost its national importance in the clothing industry to London, though the city and its fair continued to be the principal cloth market in Hampshire.<note type="foot">Keene and Rumble, <title>Medieval Winchester</title>, vol 1, pt 1, pp 293–5; <title>VCH: Hampshire</title>, vol 5, pp 36–44, <title>British History Online</title>, https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/hants/vol5/pp36-44 [accessed 1 May 2019].</note></p>
              <p>The city’s decline continued through the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, as computations based on the 1524–7 subsidy show the population had decreased to between three and five thousand while in wealth Winchester had fallen to thirty-eighth place in the country. It did remain the most populous town in Hampshire but Southampton had surged ahead in assessed wealth at £101 to Winchester’s £85.<note type="foot">Keene and Rumble, <title>Medieval Winchester</title>, vol 1, pt 1, pp 92, 368.</note> The cathedral city had a very different economy and distribution of wealth from the port. Southampton had a few wealthy merchants and a large number of people who served the port’s trade as carters, labourers, and the like, and who were too poor to be taxed. Winchester, on the other hand, had a more diverse economy, with only a few citizens in the higher ranges of taxation but a large number of craftsmen whose goods and services made enough to be taxable, if at the lowest level. A similar difference in the distribution of wealth separated Winchester from other more prosperous towns elsewhere in England. At Exeter and Norwich, for example, three per cent of the population owned goods worth over £100 in 1524, while no one did at Winchester, and only two per cent were assessed at more than £40, while at Exeter it was seven per cent and at Norwich six per cent. At the other end of the economic scale, fully sixty per cent of Winchester’s population was assessed at £4 or less, while only twenty-six per cent had so little at Exeter.<note type="foot">Keene and Rumble, <title>Medieval Winchester</title>, vol 1, pt 1, p 415.</note></p>

              <p>Winchester’s decline was further intensified in the early sixteenth century by Southampton’s loss of overseas trade to London, and by the dissolution of Winchester’s three great monasteries and four friaries, which had brought pilgrims to the town and required supporting trade from the inhabitants. Only the survival of the cathedral, the college, and the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/106916/" type="Place_Feature">hospitals of St Cross</rs> and St Mary Magdalen helped, and the city benefited from gaining possession of St John’s Hospital and its properties, the rents of which provided a substantial portion of the city’s income for the remainder of the century.<note type="foot">Adrienne Rosen, ‘Winchester in Transition, 1580–1700,' <title>Country Towns in Pre-Industrial England</title>, Peter Clark (ed), Themes in Urban History (Leicester and New York, 1981),

              <p>A further blow came from the loss of much of the cloth-finishing industry that had sustained Winchester after the departure of the Crown. By 1581 only eleven of the 100 most highly assessed taxpayers were involved in manufacturing or selling cloth (compared to sixteen gentlemen or professional men, fifteen victuallers, twelve general retailers, nine each in leather-working and metal working). In 1565 roughly 22,000 kersey cloths were exported from Hampshire through London and Southampton; by 1619 the number was under 7,000. Interest in kersey cloth had declined nationally and places like Devon and Norfolk successfully made the transition to serges and other new draperies. So did Southampton, which benefited from the arrival of Protestant Walloon refugees from the Netherlands in the 1560s who brought new techniques with them, but Hampshire in general and Winchester in particular did not make the shift rapidly enough. In the early seventeenth century Winchester was processing less than a third as much wool as Southampton was and in the 1630s the city’s cloth trade collapsed altogether.<note type="foot">Adrienne Rosen, ‘Winchester in Transition, 1580–1700,' <title>Country Towns in Pre-Industrial England</title>, Peter Clark (ed), Themes in Urban History (Leicester and New York, 1981),

              <p>Like other towns Winchester experienced a great deal of immigration from the countryside in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. By 1600 natives of Winchester made up only a third of the population of the city and the Soke. Overcrowding was not a problem at first, since the decline in population since the early Norman heyday had left open spaces in the city and a series of plagues kept the overall population growth in check.<note type="foot">Adrienne Rosen, ‘Winchester in Transition, 1580–1700,' <title>Country Towns in Pre-Industrial England</title>, Peter Clark (ed), Themes in Urban History (Leicester and New York, 1981), 155–6.</note> Indeed, John Taylor, the water poet, thought the city all but empty when he visited in 1623:</p> 
              <quote><p>On Thursday the 21st of August, I took Winchester in my way homewards, where I saw an ancient city, like a body without a soul; and I know not the reason of it, but for ought which I perceived, there were almost as many parishes as people. I lodged at the sign of the Cock, being recommended to the host of the house by a token from Salisbury; but mine host died the night before I came, and I being weary had more mind to go to bed than to follow him so long a journey, to do my message or deliver any commendations. But the whole city seemed almost as dead as mine host, and it may be they were all at harvest work. But I am sure I walked from one end of it to the other, and saw not thirty people of all sorts. So that I think if a man should go to Winchester for a goose, he might lose his labour, for a trader cannot live there by vending such commodities.<note type="foot">John Taylor, <title>Early Prose and Poetical Works of John Taylor the Water Poet (1580–1653)</title> (London and Glasgow, 1888), 240.</note></p></quote>

              <p>The early seventeenth century brought Winchester’s economic nadir yet the city was not quite so ‘dead’ as Taylor suggested. Attempts to resuscitate the cloth industry and other elements of Winchester’s earlier success were largely failures but the city economy improved somewhat in the half-century before the Civil War as it developed itself into a retail marketing and distribution centre for the region.<note type="foot">Adrienne Rosen, ‘Winchester in Transition, 1580–1700,' <title>Country Towns in Pre-Industrial England</title>, Peter Clark (ed), Themes in Urban History (Leicester and New York, 1981), 150–1.</note> Although St Giles’ Fair had lost its international and then its national importance and nearly faded away by the early modern period, the new Magdalen Hill Fair, held 14–22 July, came to flourish as a regional fair.<note type="foot">This fair, originally known as St Swithun’s Fair, received a royal grant in 1449 – a result of the citizens appealing to have a fair under their control, unlike St Giles’ Fair which was controlled by the bishop (<title>VCH: Hampshire</title>, vol 5, pp 36–44, <title>British History Online</title>, https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/hants/vol5/pp36-44 [accessed 2 May 2019]).</note> Winchester also had success in encouraging the Hampshire gentry to see the city as a social and entertainment centre.

              <head>Winchester and the Reformation</head>
              
              <p>Civic documents provide remarkably little evidence of religious conflict during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The civic leadership had learned long before the Reformation that their interests were best served by following the bishop’s lead in religious matters and avoiding conflict with ecclesiastical and royal authority.<note type="foot">Adrienne Rosen, ‘Winchester in Transition, 1580–1700,' <title>Country Towns in Pre-Industrial England</title>, Peter Clark (ed), Themes in Urban History (Leicester and New York, 1981), 160–1.</note> In the first two decades of the Reformation Winchester’s leaders paralleled the doctrinally conservative <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/139370/" type="Person_Clergy">Bishop Gardiner</rs> in leaning toward Rome yet acceding to the reformed religion; they cooperated with the royal commissioners in the disposition of the dissolved monasteries within the city. When <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/140423/" type="Person_Clergy">Robert Horne</rs> was made bishop in 1560, he found the clergy resistant to Protestantism: only six of the prebendaries of the cathedral were willing to take the oath of supremacy; six others, as well as the dean and the headmaster and second master of the college, all refused and lost their positions. The city’s reputation for recusancy continued, for when <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/188651/" type="Person_Clergy">Bishop Bilson</rs> came to Winchester in 1599 he complained in a letter to <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/145932/" type="Person_Nobility">Robert Cecil</rs> that the keeper of gaol at Winchester was especially sympathetic to recusants, treating a recusant priest as an honoured guest and letting him escape the day of his trial.<note type="foot"> Robert Tittler, <title>The Reformation and the Towns in England: Politics and Political Culture, c 1540–1640</title> (Oxford, 1998), 60; Tom Atkinson, <title>Elizabethan Winchester</title> (London, 1963), 232–3, 241–2.</note></p>
              <p>Puritanism was rare in the city. An ecclesiastical census of 1603 counted twice as many recusants as nonconformists in Winchester and the Soke. The only Sunday lecture was provided by the dean and chapter rather than by the urban businessmen, who themselves tended to have relatives and allies among the cathedral administration.<note type="foot">Adrienne Rosen, ‘Winchester in Transition, 1580–1700,' <title>Country Towns in Pre-Industrial England</title>, Peter Clark (ed), Themes in Urban History (Leicester and New York, 1981), 160, 163.</note> A Star Chamber case of 1617 involving the arrest of ten people attempting to put on a stage <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40453/" type="Drama_Type">play</rs> in a church on a Sunday afternoon seems to have had less to do with sabbatarianism amongst the civic leadership than with a private feud between the mayor and a citizen with competing business interests.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp248262848"/>.</note></p>
              <p>Like other cathedral cities (<rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/71901/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Salisbury</rs> and Wells, for example), Winchester supported the king in his struggle with parliament during the Civil War.<note type="foot">Bettey, <title>Wessex from AD 1000</title>, p 182.</note> Though it had suffered from the policies of <rs ref="https://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/24537/" type="Person_Royalty">Charles I</rs>, Winchester retained its ancient relationship with the Crown and in the Civil War became a royalist stronghold on the vague borderline between the royalist southwest and strong parliamentary support in the southeast. <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/220773/" type="Person_Gentry">Waller</rs> took the city for parliament in December 1642, his troops doing a good deal of damage to shops and the cathedral. <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/220848/" type="Person_Nobility">Sir William Ogle</rs> re-took Winchester for the royalists in October 1643, doing further damage, and 5,000 troops were stationed in the immediate area, taking a further toll on the civic economy.

            <p>Southampton has always owed its importance to topography, its sheltered port on a tongue of land between the mouths of the Test and Itchen rivers, near the northern end of the bay or inlet known as Southampton Water. The <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/2363/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Isle of Wight</rs> guards the entrance to Southampton Water, further protecting the port from the winds and currents of the North Atlantic.

            <p>Southampton’s basic plan existed by the middle of the thirteenth century and would change little through the late medieval and early modern periods. The town had a basically rectangular shape, roughly 300 metres wide from west to east and 600 metres long from north to south, bounded on the west and south by the River Test where it becomes Southampton Water. Outside the walls to the north and east lay fields, with considerable suburbs just outside the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/106652/" type="Place_Feature">Bargate</rs> to the north and at the old site of Hamwic around St Mary’s Church to the east. The castle occupied much of the northwest quadrant of the town, defending the town from attack by sea. The West Gate and Quay lay to the south of the castle. At the southeast corner of the walls stood the tower of God’s House Hospital, just east of the Watergate. English Street (now High Street) formed the backbone of the town, running from the Bargate at its north end to the Watergate on the south, with the shops and residences of many of the prominent merchants arranged along it.<note type="foot">Platt, <title>Medieval Southampton</title>, pp 43–6.</note></p>
            <p>Despite Danish attacks in the tenth and early eleventh centuries, Southampton had few fortifications at the time of the Conquest. The castle was started in the twelfth century but it took war with France in the fourteenth century to motivate the town to complete the keep and fully surround itself with stone walls.<note type="foot">Platt, <title>Medieval Southampton</title>, pp 9, 127–9, 141–2.</note> The Bargate, which defined the northern limit of the town and separated the densely built-up area from the suburbs, was first built around 1200 and considerably enlarged later.<note type="foot">Platt, <title>Medieval Southampton</title>, p 36.</note> Most eleventh- and twelfth-century buildings were constructed of timber, but in the thirteenth century prosperous burgesses began to build in stone imported from Normandy, the Isle of Wight, and Dorset – only to have their impressive stone buildings destroyed in the French raid of 1338. Rebuilding came only after peace with France in the early fifteenth century. A new quay at the Watergate and the great warehouse known as the Wool House, just inside that gate, were projects of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/220996/" type="Person_Commoner">Thomas Middleton</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1140/" type="Collective_Office">mayor</rs> from 1401 to 1404.

An estimated 250 shorn sheep per sack yields a total number of sheep of 597,250.</note> When the trade in raw wool declined in the fourteenth century it was replaced by an increase in the trade in finished cloth. Exported wool and cloth were traded for imports from France, Italy, Spain, and Flanders – particularly wine, dyestuffs, spices, and luxury goods, as well as building materials including lead, slate, and limestone.<note type="foot">Platt, <title>Medieval Southampton</title>, pp 73; Bettey, <title>Wessex from AD 1000</title>, pp 118–9.</note></p>
              <p>The demand for <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40997/" type="Thing_FoodDrink">wine</rs> came mainly from the royalty and aristocracy, making the wine trade particularly subject to the vicissitudes of war and foreign relations. The first Norman monarchs had gotten most of their wine from northern France but after the English kings lost Normandy and Anjou early in the thirteenth century, Southampton turned to southwestern France, specifically Bordeaux, as its main trading partner. The king levied a tariff in kind on wine, taking for himself one tun of wine from every shipload of ten to twenty tuns and two tuns for every shipload over twenty tuns. Much of the construction at the castle, just north of the West Quay, was therefore not defensive but rather to provide storehouses for the king’s wine, ready to be shipped to him at London, Winchester, or Clarendon, or distributed to religious houses in southern England as a gesture of royal favour.<note type="foot">Platt, <title>Medieval Southampton</title>, pp 73–4.</note></p>
              <p>Italians tended to dominate the exporting of wool in the thirteenth century, as merchants from Lucca and Florence held royal licences to export wool alongside English exporters from Winchester, Salisbury, Newport, Andover, Newbury, and Bristol. Many of the foreign merchants actually took up residence in Southampton, often marrying into burgess families. Much of the town’s economy was thus based on serving outsiders, including resident foreigners, mariners, and traders who visited the port, and soldiers who gathered in war time to garrison the town’s defences or ship overseas.<note type="foot">Platt, <title>Medieval Southampton</title>, pp  69–70, 72.</note></p>
              
              <p>Southampton suffered recession in the fourteenth century due to war with France, exacerbated in mid-century by the Black Death. The French raiders who attacked in 1338 not only started a fire that destroyed many buildings but also carried away much of the town’s stored wool and wine. Many traders, especially the foreign merchants, deserted the town, and plague, the weakened economy, and frequent attack warnings kept them away over the following half-century. The mustering of troops at Southampton in 1415 for the Agincourt campaign gave the port’s economy a jump-start and it continued to improve after peace with France in the 1420s following <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/176646/" type="Person_Royalty">Henry V</rs>’s successful French campaigns. The return of the Italian traders brought a return to prosperity that lasted until wars in Italy in the early sixteenth century greatly diminished the number of ships coming from Florence, Genoa, and Venice. The sixteenth century also brought improvements to navigation on the Thames and when London-based merchants stopped shipping through Southampton, London replaced Southampton as the dominant port for trade with the Continent.<note type="foot">Platt, <title>Medieval Southampton</title>, pp 109–30, 147–50, 152–4; Alwyn Ruddock, ‘London Capitalists and the Decline of Southampton in the Early Tudor Period,' <title>Economic History Review</title> 2.2 (1949), 137–51.</note></p>
              <p>By the reign of Elizabeth Southampton had become merely a regional port that connected Hampshire, Sussex, and Dorset with continental ports from the Low Countries to Spain. The town’s efforts to reverse this decline consisted mainly of trying to convince the national government to grant Southampton monopolies on specific commodities. The town succeeded in gaining protection for the sweet wine trade but such limited remedies could not arrest the general shift of commerce elsewhere.<note type="foot">A.L.

              <p>Like most towns, Southampton suffered in the late sixteenth century from the combination of nationwide inflation and an increase in civic expenditure as the town government’s administrative responsibilities grew. Rising population, due to rural poor moving to the towns in search of employment and poor relief, led to social tension, especially during grain shortages: in 1608 people transporting grain out of town were assaulted.<note type="foot">Peter Clark and Paul Slack, <title>English Towns in Transition 1500–1700</title> (London, Oxford, and New York, 1976), 90.</note> The civic leaders were under pressure both to provide for the poor and also to try to prevent more from coming into the town.<note type="foot">James, <title>Third Book of Remembrance</title>, pp xxii–xxiii.</note> Although those leaders were conscious of the town’s decline from its earlier glory, Southampton in fact managed to adjust rather well to its new circumstances as a regional trading centre.<note type="foot">Platt, <title>Medieval Southampton</title>, pp 221–2.</note> Southampton had not previously had a cloth industry, but weaving and other cloth-making work expanded rapidly after the arrival of the Walloon refugees in 1567, who brought skill in the making of serges that was new to England.<note type="foot">A.L.

              <p>Southampton’s population was relatively small given the port’s economic significance. The Domesday Book indicates that seventy-six heads of families resided in the town before the coming of the Normans, while another ninety-six had settled in Southampton since the Conquest, thirty-one of them English but another sixty-five from France; the total population likely numbered 650–850 at the end of the eleventh century. <note type="foot">J.B.

Southampton’s tax quota was 1,022 shillings, against 1,030 for Winchester, 1,500 for Salisbury, ninth in the country, and 4,400 for Bristol, highest outside London. <note type="foot">W.G.

              <p>The Black Death shrank the population by a third, as the poll tax of 1377 indicates Southampton had only about 1,600 adults.

              <p>Like most urban centres, Southampton saw a substantial increase in population in the late sixteenth century, despite demographic disasters like plague in 1583 and poor harvests in the 1590s. <note type="foot"> James, <title>Third Book of Remembrance</title>, p xix.</note> A head count for the 1596 muster in the burgess admission book gives a total population of 4,200, of whom 3,270 lived inside the walls, 930 outside.

              <p>For more than a century after the Conquest Southampton was effectively a royal borough but it began to gain some freedom from the control of the king and his sheriff through a charter from <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/23747/" type="Person_Royalty">King John</rs> in 1199.<note type="foot">J.B.

The independence gained from that charter was increased two years later when Southampton was made a county in its own right, distinct from Hampshire (from what had been known as the ‘county of Southampton’), thereby freeing the burgesses from interference by county officials.<note type="foot">Platt, <title>Medieval Southampton</title>, pp 165–7.</note> The civic leadership was somewhat unstable, because once a family had become wealthy through trade they tended to buy land, usually outside the town, and turn from entrepreneurs to landed proprietors.<note type="foot">Platt, <title>Medieval Southampton</title>, pp 62–3.</note> By the late sixteenth century real power was concentrated in a relatively small subset of the burgesses (approximately fifteen), led by the mayor and ex-mayors. The town’s efforts to lobby the national government to protect its trade involved seeking patronage through awarding ‘honorary burgesships’ and positions such as recorder, MP, and even mayor to influential members of the county’s landed families, including the Paulets, Lamberts, and Wallops.<note type="foot">A.L.

Many leading burgesses were benefactors of God’s House in the thirteenth century, when they also supported the Friary, established in 1233–4, providing the friars with stone buildings in the middle of the town. The fifteenth century brought a change in the religious practices of the wealthy burgesses, who began instead to direct their gifts to their own parishes and to endowing priests who would say prayers for their souls in perpetuity. In consequence, both St Denys' and God’s House had declined appreciably by the Dissolution, although God’s House survived as an almshouse.<note type="foot">J.B.

            <p>Of the other towns with surviving dramatic records perhaps the most important is <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/86811/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Andover</rs>, situated approximately eighteen miles northwest of Winchester in the Test Valley. The river that runs through Andover is the Anton, which joins the Test a few miles south of the town. Andover’s importance came largely from its position on the main road from London through Salisbury to the west, an old Roman road that intersected at Andover with another old Roman road running from Winchester northwest to Cirencester.<note type="foot"><title>VCH: Hampshire</title>, vol 4, pp 345–58, <title>British History Online</title>, https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/hants/vol4/pp345-358 [accessed 3 May 2019].</note> Andover also was a local centre for the wool trade, much of that wool distributed through the fair at nearby <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/87296/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Weyhill</rs>. Andover thus ranked fourth in wealth among Hampshire towns in the 1334 subsidy, trailing only Winchester, Southampton, and Ringwood. By the time of the 1524 subsidy Andover still ranked fifth in number of taxpayers but had fallen to tenth in wealth. Derek Keene explains that Andover’s earlier prosperity had left it with a population its economy could no longer support.<note type="foot">Keene and Rumble, <title>Medieval Winchester</title>, vol 1, pt 1, pp 91, 93.</note> The parish, manor, and borough of Andover are all three co-extensive. The manor was a royal vill at the Conquest and in 1175 Henry II granted the town a guild merchant. King John confirmed and enlarged the borough’s freedoms in a series of charters that were reaffirmed by succeeding monarchs until Elizabeth granted a new charter in 1599. The borough’s main officials were a bailiff, steward, two chamberlains, and the twenty-four aldermen, known as ‘forwardmen’ in Andover. The burgesses held the manor from the king, with the bailiff effectively acting as lord of the manor. At the time of the Elizabethan charter the guild merchant was replaced by three companies – the Leathermen, Haberdashers, and Drapers. Cloth-making was Andover’s principal industry and members of other trades were required to belong to one of those three companies.<note type="foot"><title>VCH: Hampshire</title>, vol 4, pp 345–58, <title>British History Online</title>, https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/hants/vol4/pp345-358 [accessed 3 May 2019]; Barbara Carpenter Turner, <title>A History of Hampshire</title>, The Darwen County History Series, 2nd ed (London and Chichester, 1978), 44.</note></p>
            <p><rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/87185/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Portsmouth</rs> was founded in 1194 by Richard I as a port for royal ships and in 1256 gained the right to have a guild merchant, but the town’s growth was partially restrained by Southampton’s claim that Portsmouth lay within the port of Southampton, and the latter port made continuing efforts to hold onto its position as the major southern port and restrict Portsmouth’s development.<note type="foot"> Turner, <title>History of Hampshire</title>, pp 45–6.</note> Portsmouth thus remained relatively small until the seventeenth century. The English forces sailed from Portsmouth to France before the victory at Crecy in 1346, but Portsmouth was not a walled city and the French burned it in 1338 and successfully attacked again in 1359 and 1377–80. <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/23807/" type="Person_Royalty">Henry VII</rs> directed that a dry dock be built at Portsmouth in 1495, but the town suffered from a 1563 plague and fires in the port area in 1557 and 1576. Portsmouth’s population dropped to a mere thousand in the late sixteenth century and it contributed little to resistence to the Spanish Armada in 1588. The seventeenth century saw a reversal of this decline, as a royal charter from Queen Elizabeth in 1600 gave Portsmouth corporate borough status clearly for the first time, although the charter also established that the town could not infringe on the power of the naval captain of the port.<note type="foot">Bettey, <title>Wessex from AD 1000</title>, pp 113, 144; Barbara Carpenter Turner, <title>A History of Hampshire</title>, The Darwen County History Series, 2nd ed (London and Chichester, 1978), 72.</note> The dockyard and military base were enlarged and royal and aristocratic visitors became frequent as Portsmouth served to launch both diplomatic and military ventures in the 1620s.

        <p><rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/106806/" type="Place_Feature">Winchester College</rs>, the oldest major public school in England, was founded in 1382 by <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/87704/" type="Person_Clergy">William of Wykeham, bishop of Winchester</rs> from 1367 to 1404.<note type="foot">This history of Winchester College is adapted (with permission) by Cowling from her ‘Performance at Winchester College,' pp 101–115.</note> It was the first endowment of its kind, intended as a feeder school for his earlier foundation of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/219573/" type="Place_Feature">New College</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/39267/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Oxford</rs>, in 1379. At the time it was probably the largest and best endowed school in Europe. Henry VI was later to copy this pattern of integrating school and college when he founded Eton College in 1443 as a feeder school for King’s College, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/73473/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Cambridge</rs>. The college buildings lie just south of the cathedral precinct at the southeast corner of the city.</p>
        <p>The original foundation of Winchester College consisted of the warden, ten fellows (who took on duties such as the sub-warden, the sacristan, and the bursar, in rotation), the headmaster, the usher (the only other master until 1650), three chaplains, three lay clerks, sixteen quiristers (choristers), and seventy scholars ('pauperes et indigentes'), whose education was free. There were to be no more than ten commoners, that is, those whose fathers paid for their education, but by the end of the sixteenth century the numbers of commoners had increased considerably and included day boys from Winchester after the demise of Winchester’s grammar school at the Reformation. Other boys who could claim direct descent from Wykeham, referred to as Founder’s Kin, swelled the intake, even though their conditions of entry were less stringent than those of the other scholars. Although there was often little substance in such claims of family ties to Wykeham and the process was much abused, the privilege was not abolished until the late nineteenth century. The provision for seventy scholars remains to the present day.</p>
        <p>Thanks to the prescience of the draftsman of the 1400 Founder’s Statutes and scrupulous adherence to the provisions in Rubric 41: <title>De Libris Conservandis et non Alienandis</title> ('books to be kept and not parted with'), the records of the college are well preserved and in the case of the bursars' accounts, almost complete.<note type="foot">Kirby, <title>Annals of Winchester College</title>, p 517.</note> These records attest to the varied dramatic and paradramatic activities enjoyed by the scholars from the college’s founding in the late fourteenth century until the Interregnum. These activities included both the visits of professional <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1261/" type="Entertainer_Type">entertainers</rs> and the boys’ own performances that ranged from the ceremony of the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/21537/" type="Drama_Character">boy bishop</rs> to <rs ref="https://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215119/" type="Drama_Type">plays</rs> by <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/218515/" type="Person_Male">Plautus</rs> and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/218462/" type="Person_Male">Terence</rs>.</p>
        <p>Winchester also had a grammar school attached to the cathedral, but it disappeared at the Reformation and there are no surviving records that might tell of dramatic activity there. Basingstoke’s Holy Ghost School was first mentioned in 1548 and may have been founded  as early as 1524, and Andover is known to have had a school from 1569.<note type="foot"><title>VCH: Hampshire</title>, vol 2, pp 368–71;  <title>VCH: Hampshire</title>,vol 4, pp 345–58, <title>British History Online</title> http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/hants/vol4/pp345-358 [accessed 27 July 2019].</note> However, the only other Hampshire school known to have engaged in drama was <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/123004/" type="Place_Feature">Southampton’s Free Grammar School</rs>. It was founded in 1553 by the mayor and council, who served as its governors, and was located in Winkle Street near the Watergate.<note type="foot">Butler, <title>Book of Fines</title>, vol 2, p xxi.</note></p>

          <p><rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/98105/" type="Person_Gentry">Sir John Oglander</rs> (1585–1655) was a member of a family that long had lived on the Isle of Wight. He was the son of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/125858/" type="Person_Gentry">Sir William Oglander</rs> of Nunwell, Isle of Wight, and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/221236/" type="Person_Gentry">Ann née Dillington</rs> of Knighton, Isle of Wight. He studied at Winchester College, Balliol College, Oxford, and Middle Temple, and succeeded to his father’s estates in 1609. Knighted in 1615, Oglander became deputy governor of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/87185/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Portsmouth</rs> in 1620, but gave up that position and instead was appointed deputy governor of the Isle of Wight in 1624. He represented <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/124362/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Yarmouth</rs>, Isle of Wight, in parliament in 1625, 1626, and 1628, and was sheriff of Hampshire from 1637 to 1639. Oglander supported the king during the Civil War, particularly when Charles retreated to <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/123575/" type="Place_Feature">Carisbrooke Castle</rs> on the island. Oglander lived at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/124340/" type="Place_Feature">Nunwell House</rs>, which still stands, near Brading at the eastern end of the island.</p>
          <p>Oglander’s journal, commonplace book, and accounts provide a detailed picture of his own life and that around him on the Isle of Wight. His nineteenth-century editor, W.H. Long, likens Oglander to John Aubrey, remarking that Oglander 'was a lover of gossip, and recorded for the information and amusement of posterity any particulars that struck his fancy, whether trivial or important.' Still, Long says, ‘Of everything that came under his notice personally, his account is thoroughly reliable, and his details of contemporary matters and incidents maybe safely accepted as trustworthy.' His dating can be suspect, however, and 'his statements of events which occurred before his time will not always bear strict examination.'<note type="foot">W.H.

          <p><rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/113645/" type="Person_Gentry">Sir Richard Paulet</rs> was born around 1558, the grandson of another <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/221440/" type="Person_Commoner">Richard Paulet</rs>, younger brother of the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/172771/" type="Person_Nobility">William Paulet</rs> who was the first marquess of Winchester and lord treasurer to three Tudor monarchs. Richard Paulet’s stature initially rested on the estates his grandfather and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/221301/" type="Person_Commoner">father</rs> had acquired through marriage. Herriard, valued at £200 per annum, came from his grandmother, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/221490/" type="Person_Commoner">Elizabeth Cowdrey</rs>.

By the time of his marriage Paulet had served as sheriff of Hampshire in 1583–4, as receiver for debts in Hampshire, Wiltshire, and Gloucestershire in 1585, and as high collector for his part of Hampshire for the 1586 lay subsidy. In 1590–1 he was sheriff again and attended on the queen when her progress came to his father-in-law’s estate at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/123775/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Farleigh Wallop</rs>. A year later he was knighted and made a justice of the peace, and he was heavily involved in the militia for the following decade.<note type="foot">Lindquist, 'Sir Richard Paulet,' p vii.</note></p>
          <p>A 1593 letter to <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/130613/" type="Person_Nobility">Lord Burghley</rs> seeking the office of captain of Portsmouth offers clear evidence of Paulet’s ambition. Since Burghley’s granddaughter had recently married the latest marquess of Winchester, Paulet obviously hoped to trade on family connections, but Burghley disappointed him.<note type="foot">Lindquist, 'Sir Richard Paulet,' pp vii–viii;  HRO: 44M69 F2/11/59, F2/12/2.</note> However, this setback only temporarily slowed Paulet’s steady accretion of lands and offices that led eventually to parliament. Paulet’s estates and influence were located mainly in the northern half of the county, but he was also made a burgess of Southampton in 1600, when his cousin <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/130307/" type="Person_Gentry">Thomas Lambert</rs> was mayor of the town. Lambert’s and Paulet’s mothers were sisters, both daughters of Richard Andrews of Laverstoke. Lambert too was knighted and served as an MP, and the two men engaged in several business and land ventures together. In 1601 Paulet added extensively to the scope of his estates by purchasing the wardship of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/115534/" type="Person_Gentry">Thomas Jervoise</rs>, whose inheritance included lands in Wiltshire, Shropshire, and Nottinghamshire. Jervoise was soon married to Paulet’s eldest daughter, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/115611/" type="Person_Gentry">Lucy</rs>, and as Paulet had no son he adopted his new son-in-law as his heir. In 1604 Paulet was elected to James I’s first parliament as member for <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/124626/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Whitchurch</rs> and he served again in 1610, keeping a diary that provides many details of that parliament’s debate over the 'Great Contract' that Robert Cecil aimed to forge between parliament and the king. Paulet made his first and only speech in the House of Commons in the brief 'Addled' parliament of 1614. Paulet died shortly thereafter and was buried in St Nicholas, Freefolk, where his monument dominates the small church.<note type="foot">Lindquist, 'Sir Richard Paulet,' pp vii–viii.</note></p>
          <p>Paulet was a great reader. In December 1596 he wrote this memorandum:</p>
          <quote><p>
            ‘In what sort I layde my bookes into my chest in the Closet vz On the left hand of the chest beying opening I layd and Packt all the bookes I had of Mr Puttenham, which reached halfe way the Chest</p>

          <p>Religion was certainly a great interest of Paulet’s, though it is not clear which way Paulet leaned or indeed if he had a great commitment to a particular religious position. When preparing to take refuge on the Isle of Wight during an invasion scare in 1599, Paulet noted that he intended to take with him a Bible and ‘Mr Egertons book of the principles of Religion’ (‘A noat of what Armors I must carye with me to the Isle of Wight’).<note type="foot">HRO: 44M69 G5/20/58.</note> Egerton was a famous Puritan divine, and the book was possibly his translation of a popular French treatise by Matthieu Virel. The 1610 diary of Paulet’s time in <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/36947/" type="Place_BoroughParish">London</rs> describes the many sermons he heard at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/165732/" type="Place_ReligiousHouse">Paul’s Cross</rs> and elsewhere with the same detached lack of comment with which he recorded the speeches in parliament.<note type="foot">Lindquist, 'Sir Richard Paulet,' p ix.</note> His will left money for ‘a competent yearly maintenance for a minister who also should be a sufficient preacher to instruct the people in the knowledge of gods word and administer divine service and sacraments in my church or chapel of Freefolk.’<note type="foot">TNA: PROB 11/127.</note> We thus have no way of knowing whether religion was the main reason for his 1607 purchase of a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/70656/" type="Thing_BookPlayMusic">play</rs> he called ‘the widow of watlingstreet’ – that is, the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/130684/" type="Person_Commoner">Thomas Middleton</rs> play usually known as <title><rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/131038/" type="Drama_TitledWork">The Puritan</rs></title>.</p> 
          <p>Thomas Jervoise was born 11 June 1587, only son of Thomas Jervoise of Britford, Wiltshire, but was orphaned at an early age after which he lived with his stepfather, George Wrottesley. In 1601 the fourteen-year-old Thomas’ wardship was purchased by Sir Richard Paulet; Jervoise then married Paulet’s daughter Lucy and was made Paulet’s heir. Jervoise inherited the Herriard and Freefolk estates at Paulet’s death in 1614 and continued to live in Hampshire, although he often visited the estates in Wiltshire, Worcestershire, and Shropshire inherited from his father, particularly Britford in Wiltshire and Chelmersh in Shropshire.</p>
          <p>Jervoise was knighted in 1607 and first elected to parliament in 1621 from Whitchurch, the seat that had been Paulet’s. During the 1624 session he kept a journal similar to Paulet’s if somewhat narrower in scope, as it deals only with proceedings in the Commons, and of those primarily the foreign policy debates. Jervoise held the Whitchurch seat through the Civil War, in which he staunchly supported the parliamentary side, including with some £15,000 of his own money. He died on 20 October 1654 and is buried at Herriard. Thomas’ eldest son, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/116699/" type="Person_Gentry">Richard</rs>, also supported parliament as a captain of the Hampshire militia and was killed in battle in 1645. The next oldest son, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/118468/" type="Person_Gentry">Thomas</rs>, inherited the Jervoise estates and himself served in parliament in the 1680s.</p>
          <p>The Jervoise family still own and live at Herriard Park, four and a half miles south of Basingstoke and set just to the east of the village church, St Mary’s. The current house was built in the late twentieth century, replacing a house of about 1700. Nothing is known of the earlier house used by Sir Richard Paulet and Sir Thomas Jervoise.<note type="foot">'Herriard Park,' <title>Historic England</title>, https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1000861</note> Paulet appears to have preferred Freefolk, his manor some fifteen miles west of Herriard on the River Test, a little over a mile east of Whitchurch, which both men served in parliament. St Nicholas', Freefolk, still contains an impressive monument to Paulet, who is buried there. Jervoise also spent more time at Freefolk in the years covered by the records in this collection but settled the manor on his son Richard, and when Richard died in 1643 the Freefolk estate passed to his wife’s family and was eventually sold. Nothing remains of the manor house of the seventeenth century.<note type="foot"><title>VCH: Hampshire</title>, vol 4, pp 282–5, <title>British History Online</title>, https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/hants/vol4/pp282-285 [accessed 3 May 2019].</note></p>

He lost his title and lands when his father was executed in 1552. <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/43849/" type="Person_Royalty">Queen Mary</rs> restored some of his inheritance, but he did not regain a title until Elizabeth created him earl of Hertford in 1559. The following year he secretly married <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/144352/" type="Person_Nobility">Katherine Grey</rs>, who was required to notify the sovereign of any decision to marry because of her own strong blood claim to the throne. Both Katherine and Edward were imprisoned in the Tower until Katherine’s death in 1568, when Edward was released and allowed to appear at court. In 1582 he again made a clandestine marriage to Frances Howard that only became publically known a decade later. In 1591 he attempted to gain favour with the queen by entertaining her with elaborate pageantry at Elvetham, but in 1595 he angered her again by petitioning to have his marriage to Katherine Grey proclaimed valid and his sons legitimate. He was again committed to the Tower, but only for two months, and in 1602 he was appointed lord lieutenant of Somerset and Wiltshire. Under King James he served as ambassador to Brussels and continued as lord lieutenant. He was buried in the Seymour Chapel of Salisbury Cathedral.</p>
          <p>Hertford’s principal residence was Tottenham Lodge, at Great Bedwyn, Wiltshire, which Hertford had built in preference to nearby Wulfhall, which he had inherited from his father. He also held the manor of Elvetham, Hampshire, which had been in the Seymour family since the mid-fifteenth century.<note type="foot"><title>VCH: Hampshire</title>, vol 4, pp 74–6, <title>British History Online</title>, https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/hants/vol4/pp74-76 [accessed 3 May 2019].</note> In 1602 Hertford purchased the former <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/87054/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Netley Abbey</rs> from William Paulet, the fourth marquess of Winchester, and was residing there at his death.</p>

Several attempts were made to restore his legitimacy and even to have him named Elizabeth’s successor, but neither Elizabeth nor James would agree. He was usually addressed as 'Lord Beauchamp,' his father’s lesser title, though he had no legal right to it, and he predeceased his father in 1612.</p>

          <head>Wriothesley of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/107506/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Titchfield</rs></head>
          <p><rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/121946/" type="Person_Nobility">Thomas Wriothesley</rs> was born in 1505 in London, son of William, a herald. He was educated at St Paul’s School and then Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where he was a student of Stephen Gardiner. He began to serve Thomas Cromwell in 1524 and in 1530 became joint clerk of the signet to Gardiner, who had become the <rs ref="https://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/43591/" type="Person_Royalty">king</rs>’s secretary. Cromwell and the king employed Wriothesley in a variety of matters, many of them concerning the king’s divorce from <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/138362/" type="Person_Royalty">Katherine of Aragon</rs>. He was also given the job of destroying St Swithun’s shrine at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/107876/" type="Place_Feature">Winchester Cathedral</rs> and seizing all the treasure and relics. In 1539 Thomas Wriothesley was elected to parliament as a knight of the shire for Hampshire. Wriothesley managed to survive Cromwell’s fall and became increasingly important in national affairs, eventually being named lord chancellor in 1544 and, by King Henry’s will, earl of Southampton in 1547. He was generally associated with the religious conservatives who moderated the advance of the Reformation as long as Henry VIII was alive, but after Henry’s death he came into conflict with Somerset, the Lord Protector, who feared Wriothesley might lead a Catholic coup in favour of Princess <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/43849/" type="Person_Royalty">Mary</rs>. He was placed under house arrest at his London residence, Lincoln House in Holborn, became ill and died 30 July 1550.</p> 
          
          <p>At the Dissolution the king had recognized Wriothesley’s service by granting him Titchfield Abbey and Beaulieu Abbey, as well as Quarr Abbey on the Isle of Wight. Wriothesley converted the former Titchfield Abbey buildings into a grand residence, called Place House. The impressive gatehouse with four octagonal turrets still stands, though the rest of the house has been demolished. Wriothesley’s service to Cromwell and the king meant he himself stayed only infrequently at his new Hampshire house.

St Swithun’s also celebrated the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/41365/" type="CalendarDay_Liturgical">feast of the Holy Innocents</rs> with a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/21537/" type="Drama_Character">boy bishop</rs> from the early fourteenth century until the Dissolution, as did <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/106806/" type="Place_Feature">Winchester College</rs>.</p>
          <p>Winchester College also put on its own <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215119/" type="Drama_Type">plays</rs> in the late sixteenth century, attested by accounts of the expenses of constructing the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/72682/" type="Thing_SetMachinery">stage</rs> and by descriptions in Latin dictations given by one of the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/17037/" type="Collective_Occupation">masters</rs>. A manuscript play performed at the college brought the professional theatre’s fashion for Senecan revenge tragedy into the academic setting, even appearing to echo some of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/200254/" type="Person_Commoner">Marlowe</rs>’s lines, if not his skill.</p>
          <p>Hampshire is especially rich in evidence of the activities and routes of itinerant <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/8782/" type="Entertainer_Type">players</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/8709/" type="Entertainer_Type">minstrels</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1243/" type="Entertainer_Type">musicians</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/14164/" type="Entertainer_Type">jesters</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/150141/" type="Entertainer_Type">jugglers</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/18451/" type="Entertainer_Type">dancers</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/26727/" type="Entertainer_Type">tumblers</rs>, and other performers. <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/72712/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Southampton</rs>, Winchester, and Winchester College have nearly complete sets of accounts from the late fourteenth century to the early seventeenth, augmented by occasional records from monasteries and smaller towns like <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/86811/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Andover</rs> and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/87076/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Newport</rs> (on the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/2363/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Isle of Wight</rs>). Many of these records provide details usually lacking in other such records, such as the size of visiting troupes, the exact dates of their visits, and even the names of some performers, as well as unusual combinations such as <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/214969/" type="Entertainer_Type">puppeteers</rs> travelling with a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/21804/" type="Entertainer_Type">bearward</rs>.

          <head>Monastic</head>
          
          <p>The earliest known dramatic activity in Hampshire took place in the monasteries. The <title>Regularis Concordia</title>, rules for life in Benedictine houses throughout England adopted at the council of Winchester between 965 and 975, contains the <title><rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215148/" type="Drama_TitledWork">Visitatio Sepulchri</rs></title>, including the <title>Quem quaeritis</title> trope, a sung dialogue that was part of the liturgy for matins on Easter morning and is traditionally considered to mark the beginning of medieval drama in Britain. Although there are no records of specific performances of the <title>Visitatio</title> in Hampshire, the <title>Regularis Concordia</title> is thought to be largely the work of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/204950/" type="Person_Clergy">Æthelwold, bishop of Winchester</rs> from 963 to 984, and the <title>Visitatio</title> text is also found in the <title><rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/70686/" type="Thing_BookPlayMusic">Winchester Troper</rs></title>, a collection of music created at Winchester. The <title>Visitatio Sepulchri</title> was thus almost certainly performed annually from the late tenth century up until the Dissolution by the monks of St Swithun’s Priory, and probably at Hyde Abbey, Winchester’s other Benedictine house.<note type="foot">Frere, <title>Winchester Troper</title>, p 17; Symons, <title>Regularis Concordia</title>, pp 49–50. See <ptr target="# hamps-ridp224018304"/>.</note></p>
          <p>Another practice that brought dramatic elements into the liturgy was the festival of the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/21537/" type="Drama_Character">boy bishop</rs> – choosing one of the cathedral choir boys to play the role of the bishop on the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/41365/" type="CalendarDay_Liturgical">feast of the Holy Innocents</rs> (28 December). The obedientiary accounts of St Swithun’s Priory record gifts of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40997/" type="Thing_FoodDrink">wine</rs> to the boy bishop on Innocents’ Day from 1326-7 right up to the year of the priory’s dissolution, 1536–7.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp239516672"/> and <ptr target="#hamps-ridp240040448"/>.</note> The St Swithun’s accounts consistently use the term 'episcopus iuuenum' ('bishop of the youths') rather than 'episcopus puerorum' ('bishop of the boys'), the phrasing used in the Winchester College records (see <ptr target="#hamps-ridp243520480"/>, for example). It is unlikely, though, that the St Swithun’s phrasing means that its participants were older than usual; elsewhere the ceremony is known by several names, including 'episcopus innocentium' and 'episcopus elemosinarie.'<note type="foot">Salisbury Cathedral called its boy bishop 'episcopus choristarum.' The many records of boy bishops at Durham Priory refer to the 'episcopus elemosinarie,' 'episcopus puerili,' and even 'episcopus puerili elemosinarie' (see ‘County Durham’, <title>Records of Early English Drama North-East</title>, http://community.dur.ac.uk/reed.ne/?page_id=10). Chambers mentions the St Swithun’s accounts of the boy bishop but gives more space to boy bishops at Hyde Abbey and St Mary’s convent that were probably inventions of Thomas Warton (<title>Medieval Stage</title>, vol 1, p 361; see the appendix on Warton’s records. See also James Michael John Fletcher, <title>The Boy Bishop at Salisbury and Elsewhere</title> (Salisbury, 1921); and for more recent discussions of the boy bishop, Hutton, <title>Rise and Fall</title> (Oxford, 1994; rpt 2011), 10–12, 53–4; and Max Harris, <title>Sacred Folly: A New History of the Feast of Fools</title> (Ithaca and London, 2011), 172–180. Records of boy bishops can be found in many published REED collections, and records of boy bishops at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/71901/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Salisbury</rs> and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1913/" type="Place_County">Durham</rs> will appear in forthcoming collections in <title>REED Online</title>.</note> (See <ref target="#traditions-school">School Drama</ref> for Winchester College’s boy bishop ceremonies.)</p>
          <p>St Swithun’s also employed outside <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/8782/" type="Entertainer_Type">performers</rs>, mainly <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1243/" type="Entertainer_Type">musicians</rs>, to augment the ceremonies on important feast days like <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/41461/" type="CalendarDay_Liturgical">Christmas</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/41327/" type="CalendarDay_Liturgical">Easter</rs>, and the feast of the house’s patron saint, as did <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/87427/" type="Place_ReligiousHouse">St Denys' Priory</rs> and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/87054/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Netley Abbey</rs>, both near <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/72712/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Southampton</rs>, and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/87252/" type="Place_ReligiousHouse">Southwick Priory</rs> near <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/87185/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Portsmouth</rs> (see <ref target="#traditions-performers">Travelling Performers</ref>). Other Hampshire monastic houses probably enjoyed visiting performers too but no relevant records have survived from houses like the abbeys at Hyde, Mottisfont, and Beaulieu, or the Benedictine convents of Nunnaminster (Winchester), Romsey, and Wherewell.</p>
          <p>Several stories about early dramatic and musical activity in Winchester first appeared in <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/219405/" type="Person_Commoner">Thomas Warton</rs>’s 1774 <title>History of English Poetry</title> and have been repeated in Chambers’ <title>Medieval Stage</title> and other histories of English drama. The records of the boy bishop at Winchester College that Warton included come from extant manuscripts and are thus included with the main records of <title>REED Online</title>’s Hampshire collection. However, the manuscripts in which Warton claims to have found several of his most interesting stories have not survived – or never existed – and there is reason to think that the stories may be Warton’s inventions. These stories thus appear here in an appendix with an explanation of why they are problematic (see <ref target="https://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/collections/hamps/appendix-4/">Appendix 4</ref>).</p>

          <head>Seasonal Festivity</head>
          <p><rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/3576/" type="Collective_ClergyAndChurchwardens">Churchwardens</rs>’ accounts have provided most of the evidence we have of drama at the local, parish level, although like most English counties Hampshire possesses surviving churchwardens’ accounts earlier than 1642 from only a small fraction of its parishes. Among that small fraction some accounts lack details, giving only total receipts and expenses, and others survive only from 1600 or later and thus are very unlikely to contain relevant records. If we restrict our analysis to parishes with pre-1600 accounts we find that six of the eight such parishes yield relevant records.<note type="foot">Hutton’s list of churchwardens’ accounts shows that Hampshire is about average in its number of parishes for pre-1600 churchwardens’ accounts. Hutton lists thirty-one for Devon, but only six for Gloucestershire, three for Bedfordshire, and one for Herefordshire (<title>Rise and Fall</title>, pp 263–93).</note> The implication is that dramatic activity was quite widespread in the county before the Reformation took hold. Most of the evidence of drama comes from parishes in the northern half of the county, north of Winchester, with only <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/86966/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Fordingbridge</rs> and Southampton <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/162331/" type="Place_Feature">St Lawrence's</rs> the exceptions, but we cannot infer much from that pattern as only one other parish in the southern half, Ellingham, has extant accounts, most of them summary. (These figures do not include the Isle of Wight, which is quite literally a place apart when discussing local dramatic activity.)</p>
          <p><rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/35779/ http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40561/" type="Entertainment_SeasonalCustom">King ales</rs> were the most common form of seasonal festivity in Hampshire, turning up in the records of almost every parish with surviving churchwardens’ accounts earlier than 1600. Andover, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/86922/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Bramley</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/86944/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Crondall</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/87274/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Stoke Charity</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/87296/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Weyhill</rs>, Winchester <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/107385/" type="Place_BoroughParish">St John’s</rs>, and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/87318/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Wootton St Lawrence</rs> all held king ales.

A single instance of a similar entertainment occurred at Southampton in 1554–5, when the mayor sent two men to <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/122835/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Wilton</rs> to get ‘<rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/70784/" type="Thing_TheatricalCostume">disgysinge apparrell</rs> ... in the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/35779/" type="Entertainment_SeasonalCustom">Maye</rs>’ and paid for <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/41121/" type="Thing_ClothingMaterials">green satin</rs> ‘for the Mayes <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/71388/" type="Thing_TheatricalCostume">gowne</rs>.'<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp227436912"/>.</note></p>
          <p>Several parishes (<rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/123663/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Hartley Wespall</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/123597/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Pamber</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/123619/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Stratfield Saye</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/123641/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Silchester</rs>, and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/47323/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Yately</rs>) contributed money to, and presumably took part in, king ales in nearby parishes in Hampshire and across the county border in <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1751/" type="Place_County">Berkshire</rs> (see the king ales at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/46722/" type="Place_Feature">St Laurence's</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/46700/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Reading</rs>). The term ‘king ale’ appears to be a regional one: though many counties held ales involving a king or lord figure, the event was called a ‘king ale’ most frequently in Hampshire and the surrounding counties. In addition to Reading, Sherborne (Dorset) called its festivity a ‘king ale,' as did Steyning (Sussex), but the phrase does not turn up in records from Kent, Devon, or Somerset.<note type="foot">Rosalind Conklin Hays et al (eds), <title>Dorset / Cornwall</title>, REED (Toronto and Buffalo, 1999), 32–3, 250–5; Cameron Lewis (ed), <title>Sussex</title>, REED (Toronto and Buffalo, 2000), 167–8.</note></p>
          <p>The Hampshire records never explain exactly what a king ale involved, though we can infer that the custom involved at the least choosing a mock king or lord to preside over ale drinking, feasting, and other revelry. A 1580 consistory court case concerning a matrimonial dispute at Newton Valence identified <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/120272/" type="Person_Commoner">John Smith</rs> as ‘<rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/59852/" type="Drama_Character">somer lord</rs>’ and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/120337/" type="Person_Commoner">Clarice Baker</rs> as ‘sumer lady of newton.'<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp223047280"/>.</note> The churchwardens of Wootton St Lawrence paid for the ‘<rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/42274/" type="Thing_TheatricalCostume">Ladyes Lyueries</rs>’ and the ‘Lordes Lyueries’ for an elaborate king ale in 1600.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp248828864"/>.</note> Payments to minstrels for contributing to the festivities are common, there are occasional references to <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/79074/" type="Entertainment_SeasonalCustom">morris</rs> <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/42342/" type="Thing_MusicalInstrument">bells</rs> and dancing, and in the 1550s St John’s Winchester accounts, 11d was paid for ‘<quote source="#hamps-ridp248553248">payntynge of the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215895/" type="Thing_SetMachinery">clothe</rs> vpon<ex>n</ex> the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/214346/" type="Thing_SetMachinery">somerloge</rs></quote>.' Hampshire king ales must have resembled the summer game at Wistow, Yorkshire West Riding, where a 1469 court case tells us, 'Iuuuenes ville de Wistow adinuice<ex>m</ex> h<ex>ab</ex>ebant prout mos p<ex>at</ex>rie ib<ex>ide</ex>m vnu<ex>m</ex> ludu<ex>m</ex> estiualem vulgarit<ex>er</ex> vocatu<ex>m</ex> Som<ex>er</ex>game' ('The young people of the town of Wistow, according to a custom of the land, would together hold a summer game, commonly called "Somergame"'). The youth of the parish chose a king and queen who, led by a minstrel, processed to the barn called the ‘Som<ex>er</ex>house’ where they engaged in plays or games for the rest of the day.<note type="foot">Borthwick Institute: CP.F.246, sheet 1; record forthcoming in REED's <title>Yorkshire West Riding</title> collection, edited by C.E. McGee and Sylvia Thomas.</note></p>
          <p>The earliest records of king ales in the county come from <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/86811/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Andover</rs>, where a coroner’s report of 1381 describes how a man was killed by falling on another’s knife during a ‘<quote source="#hamps-ridp219992864"><rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/35779/" type="Entertainment_SeasonalCustom">Kyngespleye</rs></quote>.' Andover accounts for a king ale in 1471 reveal that pairs of men and women (‘<quote source="#hamps-ridp220059024">Richard Curtes &amp; Philypp Mora<ex>n</ex>tt<ex>es</ex> wiff</quote>’) collected donations to support the parish finances.<note type="foot">A similar pattern of men and women collecting in pairs for the king play occur in the records of St Edmund’s, Salisbury, for the 1460s.<note type="foot">Records forthcoming in REED's <title>Wiltshire including Salisbury</title> collection, edited by C.E. McGee, Rosalind Hays, and Audrey Douglas.</note> It is uncertain whether that pattern was common in the region, or perhaps shows up in these two parishes because they were connected by the main road from London that led through Andover to Salisbury and on to Exeter.</note> The king ale records from other parishes come mostly from the sixteenth century, decreasing in number as the Reformation spread across the county. <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/108540/" type="Person_Clergy">Thomas Cooper, bishop of Winchester</rs>, issued a diocesan letter in 1585 that called for an end to ‘<quote source="#hamps-ridp222116096">Church Ales, maygames, morish daunces, and other vaine pastimes ... which they have pretended to be for the relief of their Churches....</quote>’ The strongly Protestant Cooper was distressed by the number of those in his diocese who clung to such traditional popish practices, complaining that it ‘is a straunge perswasion among Christians, that they can not by any other meane of contribution repaire their Churches, and set forth the service of God, but that they must first do sacrifice to the Devill, with <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/45503/" type="CrimesMisdemeanors">Dronkennes</rs> and dauncing, and other ungodly wantonnes.' Parishes that held king ales were among the most resistant to change: Wootton St Lawrence saw its incumbent removed, Stoke Charity was one of the last churches to obey the 1559 directive to remove side altars, and Bramley did not exchange its Catholic chalice for a Protestant communion cup until 1571.<note type="foot">Haigh, <title>English Reformations</title>, p 245.</note> Some parishes may have continued their king ales, hiding what they were up to by recording the receipts only as ‘<quote source="#hamps-ridp221118496">clere gaines at whytsontide</quote>.' Bramley’s churchwardens did not call their ale a king ale after 1532–3, but records of Banbury, Oxfordshire, tell us that Bramley’s players travelled there in 1555–6.<note type="foot">Alexandra F.

          <p>Certainly Cooper was right that many parishes relied on king ales as their main source of income. Wootton St Lawrence’s churchwardens spent the considerable sum of £7 13s 10d on their king ale in 1600, including 23s 10d for minstrels and 8s 6d for the lords’ and ladies’ ‘Lyueries,' but they collected enough money from the participants that the event made a profit of £3 17s 1 1/2d, roughly four times as much as the 19s 4d the parish received in income from all other sources. Ronald Hutton notes that ‘as church ales became rarer, they also tended to be more spectacular when they were held’ and Wootton St Lawrence’s is his primary example.<note type="foot"><title>The Stations of the Sun: A History of the Ritual Year in Britain</title> (Oxford, 1996), 255. However, in <title>Rise and Fall</title>, p 158, he incorrectly asserts of Wootton St Lawrence that ‘after 1605 it ceased to hold any’ king ales.</note> Many parishes had no other means of meeting their expenses, especially for poor relief and repairs to the church fabric, until they began to impose rates on all the parishioners, typically in the second or third decades of the seventeenth century.</p>
          <p>The Isle of Wight had its own form of May game, described both in Newport’s 'Ligger Book'   and in Sir John Oglander's commonplace book. On the first Sunday in May, the young people of Newport went in <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40619/" type="Entertainment_Type">procession</rs> into nearby <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/126758/" type="Place_Feature">Parkhurst Forest</rs>, accompanied by a minstrel and morris dancers and led by a man called the ‘<rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/68135/" type="Drama_Character">Vice</rs>’ and by a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/59852/" type="Drama_Character">lord</rs> appointed by the town bailiffs.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp222900944"/>.</note> This custom, connected with the people’s right to gather wood in the royal forest, lasted as late as 1621.<note type="foot">See Cowling, ‘Wood Eaves,' pp 20–8.</note> The island also had the more usual kind of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/35779/" type="Entertainment_SeasonalCustom">May celebration</rs>, as Oglander tells of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/122058/" type="Person_Gentry">Sir John Leigh</rs> and his future wife, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/122384/" type="Person_Commoner">Elizabeth Dingley</rs>, first meeting when they were <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/59852/" type="Drama_Character">lord and lady of the <rs ref="https://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/41249/ http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/35779/" type="Thing_SetMachinery">maypole</rs></rs>.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp223174880"/>.</note>  Oglander’s description does not indicate whether these members of the gentry were joining in a festivity of the local folk or engaging in some kind of aristocratic imitation, much as one cannot tell exactly what was happening when the parish churchwardens of Crondall rewarded a minstrel for playing with some morris dancers ‘before my lady <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/97542/" type="Person_Nobility">marques of Exeter</rs>’ in 1554–5.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp221504208"/>.</note></p>
          
          
          <p>The <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/41461/" type="CalendarDay_Liturgical">Christmas season</rs> also occasioned festive customs, though Hampshire offers less evidence for that time of year. A 1563 coroner’s report tells us that one <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/114553/" type="Person_Commoner">John Hypper</rs> of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/87032/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Houghton</rs> died after being struck in the testicles while ‘<quote source="#hamps-ridp222162128">playnge <ex>Christ</ex>enmas games</quote>’ in his house. <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/14146/" type="Drama_Character">Lords of misrule</rs> commonly appeared at Christmas, such as the one fined by the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1140/" type="Collective_Office">mayor</rs> of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/72712/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Southampton</rs> in 1521 for taking geese and a boar in the street and the one rewarded by Sir Richard Paulet in 1600.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp227069824"/> and <ptr target="#hamps-ridp223546224"/>. Neither of these records of lords of misrule is definitely datable to the Christmas season, and it is possible that they were connected to summer games instead.</note> Paulet was also visited by <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/134052/" type="Entertainer_Type">wassailers</rs> from villages near his houses at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/87010/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Herriard</rs> and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/106707/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Freefolk</rs> at Christmas time.</p>
          <p><rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40815/" type="Entertainment_SeasonalCustom">Hocking</rs> was another custom common in the county. Records of money collected at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/72132/" type="CalendarDay_Liturgical">Hocktide</rs> come from rural parishes like Herriard and South Warnborough and from urban ones like St Lawrence’s Southampton and St John’s Winchester. Most of the records date to the middle of the sixteenth century, but at South Warnborough and Alton as late as the 1620s. Hocktide festivities were held on the Monday and Tuesday of the week following <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/41327/" type="CalendarDay_Liturgical">Easter week</rs>. The most common form of the festivity involved groups of men or women taking ‘prisoner’ individuals of the opposite sex and forcing them to pay a fine to be released. Regional variations appear to have been common, however, as Sir Francis Taverner describes the festivity in his parish of Hexton, Hertfordshire, as involving a contest between the men and women of the parish to pull a pole from the top of a hill to the bottom. The women were always the victors and in fact the women usually end up dominating the men at Hocktide and gathering the largest sum for the parish. The funds thus gathered were given to the parish especially for poor relief but also to pay for repairs to the church fabric and other parish expenses. The Bramley accounts for 1561–2 are notable in specifying that the hocking money was used to purchase two table cloths and a ‘treue vessell.'<note type="foot"> See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp220873504"/>. Taverner says that at Hexton part of the money gathered was 'then given to the poore, the remaining money the Hockers delivered unto the Churchwardins, who layd out the same in reparation of the church, and Bells and the like’ (BL: Add. MS 6223, f 12v). If Taverner is correct, then in some years all the gatherings from hocking may have been given to the poor directly so that no amount from hocking shows up in the churchwardens’ accounts. See also Sally-Beth MacLean, ‘Hocktide: A Reassessment of a Popular Pre-Reformation Festival,' <title>Festive Drama: Papers from the Sixth Triennial Colloquium of the International Society for the Study of Medieval Theatre, Lancaster, 13–19 July, 1989</title>,  Meg Twycross (ed) (Cambridge, MA, 1996), 233–41.</note> Taverner resembles Sir John Oglander of the Isle of Wight in writing regretfully in the 1630s or 40s of practices that have disappeared. Taverner sums up his description of Hexton’s hocking: ‘I think these nicer tymes of ours, would not only despise these sports, but also account them ymmodest, if not prophane, But those playne and well meaning people did Solace them selves in this manner, and that without offence or Scandall.'<note type="foot"> BL: Add.

          <head>Civic Entertainment: Musicians</head>
          <p>Homegrown dramatic activity in Hampshire appears to have been sponsored almost exclusively by parishes; the towns instead relied on the performances of itinerant troupes. The towns did however employ musicians for a range of entertainment and ceremonial functions. Southampton’s records provide a great deal of detail about the town's musicians and their relations with the civic government. The first mention of the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/154950/" type="Collective_Office">town musicians, or waits</rs>, in Southampton’s own records comes in the steward’s accounts for 1433–4, but the town had employed musicians at least forty years earlier, as Winchester’s chamberlains gave 18d to three ‘<rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/13000/" type="Collective_Office">ministrall<ex>is</ex> de Hampton</rs>’ in 1394–5 and Salisbury rewarded Southampton’s musicians in 1398–9.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp224739600"/> and <ptr target="#hamps-ridp245330048"/>. Greenfield, 'Using Dramatic Records,' p 81, suggests that the musicians Southampton took on in 1433–4 were its first town musicians; the 1394–5 record from Winchester has since come to light. The 1398–9 record from Salisbury comes from a transcription of the mayor’s account by Audrey Douglas, forthcoming in REED's <title>Wiltshire including Salisbury</title> collection, edited by C.E. McGee, Rosalind Hays, and Audrey Douglas: ‘It<ex>e</ex>m iij ministrall<ex>is</ex> Ville Suth<ex>am</ex>t<ex>onie</ex> ij s.’ (Salisbury Corporation Ledger Book A, WSA: G/23/1/1, f 13 (rendered 26 September 1399)).</note> The group mentioned in 1433–4 may have been adopted by Southampton in that very year. The 1428–9 accounts do not mention any musicians of the town so the group of the 1390s must have died or moved on. In 1433–4, though, a rough set of steward’s accounts includes among expenses for a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40561/" type="Entertainment_Type">feast</rs> in the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/155639/" type="Place_Feature">guildhall</rs> on 13 January a reward of 20d the mayor gave to ‘<quote source="#hamps-ridp224942528">minstrell<ex>is</ex> de Wynchest<ex>er</ex> q<ex>u</ex>i m<ex>od</ex>o sunt ap<ex>u</ex>d suthampton</quote>.' The fair copy of the accounts indicates that on 16 January ‘p<ex>re</ex>d<ex>ic</ex>tis minstrell<ex>is</ex>’ received 6s 8d as their wages for a quarter of the year and Robert Pyle of Salisbury was paid ‘p<ex>ro</ex> vestitu Mynstrell<ex>orum</ex> de Suth<ex>amptonie</ex>.' In addition, the steward claimed expenses for going to Winchester on 11 May to go bail for three minstrels named <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/135334/" type="Person_Commoner">Richard March</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/135853/" type="Person_Commoner">John Goddislond</rs>, and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/135590/" type="Person_Commoner">William Goldfynch</rs>. The mayor of Winchester, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/135655/" type="Person_Commoner">Walter Hore</rs>, had requested that the minstrels be arrested and both they and the steward were questioned by justices at the assizes. A year later Southampton’s minstrels received both wages and new <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/43439/" type="Thing_LiveryRegalia">liveries</rs> and the wages were paid to Richard ‘Wayte,' John ‘Wayte,’ and William ‘Wayte.'<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp225421648"/>.</note> It appears that this group of three musicians played for the mayor and council at the feast in January and were then adopted as the civic waits by Southampton. The fact that they were 'de’ Winchester before they were ‘apud’ Southampton may only mean they came ‘from’ Winchester, but their arrest by the mayor of Winchester shortly afterward suggests they were ‘of’ Winchester; that is, they had previously been employed as <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/156198/" type="Collective_Office">Winchester’s waits</rs> and that city was not ready to part with them. Southampton went to considerable expense to employ these musicians, paying for liveries as well as wages and protecting them at the assizes, but after a four-year gap in the accounts there is no trace of them in the town’s records for 1438–9.</p>
          <p>Town musicians then appear infrequently in Southampton’s records until the early seventeenth century. In 1493 the town paid for liveries for three waits, probably the same ‘ministral' ville Southampton<ex>ie</ex>’ who played at St Denys' Priory, just north of the town, on the saint’s feast day in that year.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp226266080"/> and <ptr target="#hamps-ridp224376608"/>.</note> Almost a century later there appears to have been only a single musician, as ‘<quote source="#hamps-ridp227692928"><rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/142061/" type="Person_Commoner">henrie the Minstrell</rs></quote>’ was paid £4 in 1579 for ‘his ffredome of the keping of the waightes’ and he received his livery for several years. In 1587 the town gave him a poor boy as an <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/55239/" type="Collective_Occupation">apprentice</rs>.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp227988960"/>.</note> By 1594 there were multiple musicians, as the town gave liveries to ‘<quote source="#hamps-ridp227923648">weightes</quote>.'</p>
          <p>In 1607 Southampton increased the size of the town consort, providing liveries for five musicians and also having two ‘<rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/42646/" type="Thing_LiveryRegalia">Scuttchins</rs>’ of silver made for the waits to wear, ‘<quote source="#hamps-ridp228684272">impressed w<ex>i</ex>th the Townes Armes; Namelye, three Ross [Roses] the l<ex>ett</ex>re H; and the forme of a Tonne</quote>.' From that time on the town musicians appear frequently in the records, up to and through the Interregnum. In the 1620s and 1630s, when the town sent players away without allowing them to perform, it regularly gave the musicians new liveries and in 1629 gave them three more silver scutcheons so that all five musicians had such badges.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp228872048"/>.</note> The musicians kept the ‘benevolences’ and other payments they received for performing in a box, from which one of their number stole in 1633.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp239390272"/>.</note> The town also placed poor children with them as apprentices and did what it could to help the musicians make a living beyond the official wages it paid, licensing them to keep <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/21077/" type="Collective_Occupation">alehouses</rs> and engage in ‘huckstering’ – buying up wares at the market before it opened and reselling them at higher prices.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp228759040"/>.</note> All these records give the musicians’ names, allowing us to keep track of the make-up of the consort.</p>
          <p>At Winchester unidentified minstrels had been rewarded for playing at the annual dinners of the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/154325/" type="Collective_GuildReligious">fraternity</rs> of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/106751/" type="Place_Feature">St John</rs> as early as 1389–90,<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp245757152"/>.</note> but the first definite evidence that the city employed  musicians appears in the 1397–8 chamberlains’ accounts, which include payments for <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/41702/" type="Thing_ClothingMaterials">cloth</rs> for liveries for ‘<quote source="#hamps-ridp245360592">ministrall<ex>is</ex> Ciuitat<ex>is</ex></quote>.' The same year they were paid for getting the ‘Tron,' the city’s weighing machine that was taken up <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/111361/" type="Place_Feature">St Giles’ Hill</rs> each year at the time of the annual <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/43457/" type="Entertainment_Type">fair</rs>. The city again paid for cloth for its minstrels in 1406–7, but we only know that they continued for another sixty years from the occasional rewards to entertainers of the city in the records of Winchester College, where they first appear in 1398–9.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp245417136"/> and <ptr target="#hamps-ridp241445440"/>.</note> The college bursars refer to them variously as ‘ministralli,' ‘mimi,' ‘lusores,' and in the 1470–1 bursars’ accounts, as ‘<quote source="#hamps-ridp242432624">le Waytys Ciuitat<ex>is</ex> Winton<ex>ie</ex></quote>.' It seems probable that the minstrels who performed at the annual dinners of Winchester’s fraternity of St John were the city’s own musicians but the fraternity’s accounts never provide a specific identification. From 1470–1 to the early seventeenth century no entertainers identified as the city’s own appear in any of the extant records. Then in 1611–12 Winchester College rewarded ‘<quote source="#hamps-ridp244223904">musicis de Civit<ex>ate</ex> Winton<ex>ie</ex></quote>,' and similar payments occur in the college accounts every year or two right up to 1642. These musicians first appear in the city’s own coffer accounts in 1614 and they appear frequently in the records thereafter, including in 1638 when they received new coats. Their leader in 1620 was <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/199358/" type="Person_Commoner">James Beale</rs>, later replaced by someone named <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/202970/" type="Person_Commoner">Combes</rs> by 1633.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp248290256"/>, <ptr target="#hamps-ridp248491552"/>, <ptr target="#hamps-ridp248298976"/>, and <ptr target="#hamps-ridp248432256"/>.</note></p>
          <p>The other Hampshire town with many records of musicians is <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/86811/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Andover</rs>, which has the earliest record of an entertainer in Hampshire. The Domesday Book states that ‘<rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/221943/" type="Person_Commoner">Adelina</rs> joculatrix’ held one virgate of land in Upper Clatford in Andover hundred that was given to her by <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/221989/" type="Person_Nobility">Earl Roger of Hereford</rs>.<note type="foot">Domesday indicates that the king was lord of the manor of Upper Clatford, ‘de feudo comitis Rogerij’; Munby’s note explains that <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/221989/" type="Person_Nobility">Earl Roger</rs>, son of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/222133/" type="Person_Nobility">William Fitz Osbern</rs>, had ‘forfeited his lands after the rebellion of 1075' (Julian Munby (ed),  <title>Domesday Book</title>, vol 4, <title>Hampshire</title> (Chichester, 1982), section 1, 25).</note> The record is an especially intriguing one since it refers to a female performer. (Another of the rare examples of female performers is the ‘<quote source="#hamps-ridp223849344"><rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/195926/" type="Person_Commoner">minstrell mayde</rs></quote>' who visited <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/113645/" type="Person_Gentry">Sir Richard Paulet</rs> in 1613.) She perhaps had been a performer in Earl Roger’s household. Munby’s edition translates ‘joculatrix’ as ‘Jester’ but the Latin word can mean ‘juggler’ and perhaps just <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1261/" type="Entertainer_Type">entertainer</rs> in a generic sense – thus not distinguishing between juggler, jester, musician, minstrel, actor, or other more specific kind of performer.<note type="foot">See the REED <title>Anglo-Latin Wordbook</title>, https://reed.utoronto.ca/wordbook/#I [accessed 12 May 2019].</note></p>
          <p>Most of the evidence of musicians living at Andover comes from wills and inventories of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth century. The 1558 will of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/83476/" type="Person_Gentry">William Calley</rs> does not specifically identify him as a musician but he had few possessions to leave other than a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/71682/" type="Thing_MusicalInstrument">lute</rs> and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/71848/" type="Thing_MusicalInstrument">gittern</rs>.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp220229760"/>.</note> <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/84500/" type="Person_Commoner">William Glover</rs>, on the other hand, is called a musician and a 1638 inventory shows that he owned books of music as well as instruments.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp219993568"/>.</note> This Glover may well have been from a family of musicians, as a musician called ‘<rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/84567/" type="Person_Commoner">William Glover the elder</rs>’ leased two tenements in Charlton, near Andover, from Winchester College in 1593, so the William Glover who died in 1638 may have been his son, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/84640/" type="Person_Commoner">William Glover the younger</rs>.<note type="foot">Himsworth, <title>Winchester College Muniments</title>, vol 2, p 89.</note> <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/222215/" type="Person_Male">Nicholas Fishborne</rs> is also identified as a musician of Andover in a 1646 will and inventory.<note type="foot">HRO: 1646A/25.</note> Perhaps Fishborne and the Glovers were among the musicians from Andover rewarded by Winchester College in 1629–30.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp244733792"/>.</note>  Nothing in the extant records shows whether they served as town musicians like those of Winchester and Southampton. Given Andover’s location on the main road that led from London to Salisbury and Exeter, musicians there might have found their main occupation in playing for visitors at the town’s inns, much as the local musicians did at Ware where the town’s lord high steward protected the livelihoods of resident musicians by restricting ‘foren’ musicians from performing ‘in any Inn or vsuall resortinge place’ for more than a single night.<note type="foot">BL: Add.

          <p>Most of the dramatic and musical activity mentioned in the records of Winchester College was provided by visiting entertainers but the boys themselves also performed.<note type="foot">For a detailed discussion of the evidence from Winchester College, see Cowling, ‘Performance at Winchester College,' pp 101–15.</note> The records discussed here add a good deal to our understanding of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215119/" type="Drama_Type">school drama</rs>, which has not been studied as extensively as drama at the universities.<note type="foot">Motter’s <title>School Drama in England</title> is still the only book-length study devoted to school drama and it is a general survey that ranges up to the early twentieth century. More recent books that include some treatment of school drama include Lynn Enterline, <title>Shakespeare’s Schoolroom: Rhetoric, Discipline, Emotion</title> (Philadelphia, 2011), and Elisabeth Dutton and James McBain (eds), <title>Drama and Pedagogy in Medieval and Early Modern England</title>, Swiss Papers in English Language and Literature 31 (Tübingen, 2015).</note> Blewitt’s 1984 survey of the dramatic records of Winchester and Eton uses primary research but ends in 1576; it does not include the records of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1243/" type="Entertainer_Type">musicians</rs> (who may have ‘played’ in a variety of ways) nor the most interesting of the records examined here, those of the scholars’ own performances.<note type="foot">‘Drama at Winchester and Eton,' pp 88–95, 135–43.</note></p>
          <p>The earliest form of dramatic activity performed by the scholars themselves appears to have been the celebration of the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/21537/" type="Drama_Character">boy bishop</rs>. That celebration was common before the Reformation at cathedrals, including Winchester’s, at religious houses, and at educational institutions, including <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/219573/" type="Place_Feature">New College</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/39267/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Oxford</rs>, with which Winchester College was linked by the founder of both, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/87704/" type="Person_Clergy">William of Wykeham</rs>.<note type="foot">At least four other Oxford colleges had boy bishops (John R. Elliot et al (eds), <title>Oxford</title>, vol 2, REED (Toronto and Buffalo, 2004), 612).</note> Winchester College followed St Swithun’s in staging its boy bishop celebration on the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/41365/" type="CalendarDay_Liturgical">feast of the Holy Innocents</rs>, 28 December, unlike Eton, which used <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/41406/" type="CalendarDay_Liturgical">St Nicholas’ Day</rs>, 6 December. The boy bishop was possibly chosen from among the junior scholars and held office for a single day. Rubric 29 of the Founder’s Statutes allows for scholars to say or sing vespers, matins, and other divine offices on that day.<note type="foot">Kirby, <title>Annals of Winchester College</title>, p 503.</note> An inventory of 1521–2 includes the cloth-of-gold <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/72012/" type="Thing_TheatricalCostume">mitre</rs> that William of Wykeham had donated for the use of the boy bishop.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp243520480"/>.</note> Other donations for the office were a pastoral <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/71437/" type="Thing_property">staff</rs> and the crozier of copper-gilt which was carried before him in procession. The statutes do not describe the exact form of the ceremony but it is likely that Winchester College followed the practice at Salisbury, which William of Wykeham specified in his statutes for New College.<note type="foot">John R. Elliot et al (eds), <title>Oxford</title>, vol 1, REED (Toronto and Buffalo, 2004), 12.</note> The <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/156198/" type="Collective_Office">Winchester waits</rs>, the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/154663/" type="Collective_Office">bishop</rs>’s <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1243/" type="Entertainer_Type">musicians</rs>, and other performers visited the college to join in the ceremonies. In 1405 the boy bishop paid the waits 8d for their performance and in 1412–13 men of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/106872/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Ropley</rs> were paid for <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/18451/" type="Entertainer_Type">dancing</rs> and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/10906/" type="Entertainer_Type">singing</rs> in the hall before the scholars' bishop, so it is possible that the boy bishop took up a collection from which he could make such disbursements.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp241492592"/> and <ptr target="#hamps-ridp241640688"/>.</note></p>
          <p>The Reformation brought an end to the boy bishop, but the greatest period of dramatic activity at Winchester College began in 1561 with the arrival of a new schoolmaster, Dr <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/218259/" type="Person_Commoner">Christopher Johnson</rs>. The details of Johnson’s influence emerge from his dictated lessons, as written down by a scholar named <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/219137/" type="Person_Commoner">William Badger</rs> between 1563 and 1567. These <ref target="https://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/collections/hamps/appendix-1/">‘Dictates’</ref> are contained in a small booklet titled <title>Themes at Winchester School</title> (BL: Add. Ms 4379). Of the 422 dictates in Badger’s notebook, eight have particular significance for drama historians and give us a clear picture of how often and under what conditions <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215119/" type="Drama_Type">plays</rs> were acted by the scholars. The plays were mostly in Latin and staged twice a year, at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/41461/" type="CalendarDay_Liturgical">Christmastime</rs> and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/200104/" type="CalendarDay_Liturgical">Shrovetide</rs>.</p>
          <p>In a dictate concerning plays (‘spectacula’) at Christmas 1563–4 Johnson refers to characters who appear in <title><rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/218325/" type="Drama_TitledWork">Acolastus</rs></title>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40362/" type="Drama_Type">a prodigal son play</rs> by Dutchman <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/218044/" type="Person_Commoner">William Fullonius</rs>, written in Latin in 1529 (f 20v). During Shrovetide in 1564 the boys acted in a Greek play which – according to the wording of the dictate – was a rare occurrence (f 27v). The following Christmas (1564–5) the bursars’ accounts, under ‘Expenses for buildings and repairs,' record a sum of 11s 6d paid out for expenses regarding the plays in the Christmas holidays.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp243815712"/>.</note> In the corresponding dictate, Johnson comments favourably on the boys’ acting styles but his good temper seems not to have lasted, for in the dictate referring to the second of the plays performed at this time he comments somewhat irascibly on the nature of comedies and the difficulties of staging them: ‘Quid enim aliud est com<ex>o</ex>edia quam negotiosum nihil?’ ('For what else is comedy than a laborious nothing?') (f 89).</p> 
          <p>A manuscript tragedy called <title><rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215175/" type="Drama_TitledWork">Pelopidarum Secunda</rs></title> has an epilogue indicating it was performed at Winchester College, probably for the annual Founder’s Day celebration.<note type="foot">See <ref target="https://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/collections/hamps/appendix-3/">Appendix 3</ref>; the editors are grateful to Martin Wiggins for calling their attention to this play. It is number 840 in his <title>British Drama</title>, vol 3, pp 1–4. Wiggins dates the play to 1590, linking it to the mention of a 'teatro' in the bursar’s accounts for that year, but there are several other such records in the accounts and Johnson’s dictates mention plays in years when no stage or theatre was constructed, so any such date must remain conjectural.</note> The play, which is written in English despite the Latin title, tells the well-known story of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215369/" type="Drama_Character">Agamemnon</rs>’s death and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215523/" type="Drama_Character">Orestes</rs>’ revenge on <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215281/" type="Drama_Character">Clytemnestra</rs> and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215347/" type="Drama_Character">Aegisthus</rs>. The play is very long, written in several hands, and has thirty-six speaking parts, making it eminently suitable for school production.</p>
          <p>Between 1615 and 1637 a Winchester scholar called <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/195031/" type="Person_Commoner">Christopher Longland</rs> was killed by a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/222316/" type="Thing_Property">sword</rs> wound while acting in another tragedy. A poem written by one of his friends and titled 'On ye Death of Longland slaine in acting a Tragedy' hints at the circumstances:</p>

          <p><rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/123004/" type="Place_Feature">Southampton’s Free Grammar School</rs> also staged drama though the records are much less extensive than those of Winchester College. The mayor and council served as the school’s governors and in 1565–6 the mayor gave 6s 8d to ‘<quote source="#hamps-ridp227479184"><rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/139946/" type="Person_Commoner">Mr Leythe</rs> <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/17037/" type="Collective_Occupation">Scholemaster</rs> for his play</quote>.' A decade later the mayor gave 20s to ‘<quote source="#hamps-ridp227609696">Mr Adrian for his charges and pains in his tragedie</quote>,' <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/141956/" type="Person_Clergy">Adrian (or Hadrian) Saravia</rs> having been the school’s headmaster from 1571 to 1578. The word ‘tragedie’ suggests that the Southampton boys were performing classical works, perhaps in Latin, like their Winchester counterparts. ‘<quote source="#hamps-ridp227704528">Mr Caliu<ex>er</ex>s playe</quote>,' for which the town contributed 16d for <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/73500/" type="Thing_SetMachinery">paper</rs> and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/142191/" type="Thing_SetMachinery">candles</rs> in 1581–2, must also have been a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215119/" type="Drama_Type">school play</rs> as ‘<rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/142220/" type="Person_Clergy">Mr Caliuer</rs>’ was John Calvert, vicar of St Michael’s and Saravia’s successor as schoolmaster.<note type="foot">Butler, <title>Book of Fines</title>, vol 2, p xxi; Russell, <title>King Edward VI School</title>, p 350.</note> The records do not indicate whether the mayor actually saw the play performed; if he did, the boys may have performed in the council chamber on the upper floor of the Bargate where itinerant performers entertained the mayor and council, or the mayor may have gone to see the boys at the school itself in Winkle Street near the Watergate.</p>

          <head>Household Entertainment</head>
          
          <p>The most elaborate entertainments enjoyed by Hampshire’s aristocratic households occurred when <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40648/" type="Entertainment_Type">royalty visited</rs> the county. <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/205235/" type="Person_Royalty">Edward I</rs> and his son <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/44180/" type="Person_Royalty">Edward</rs>, Prince of Wales, spent the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/41461/" type="CalendarDay_Liturgical">Christmas</rs> season of 1302–3 in Hampshire, the king at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/155591/" type="Place_Feature">Odiham Castle</rs> in the northeastern corner of the county and the prince some three miles south at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/218970/" type="Person_Gentry">Sir Roger Pedwardyn</rs>’s manor of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/87230/" type="Place_BoroughParish">South Warnborough</rs>. The royal wardrobe accounts paid for three clerks from <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/38787/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Windsor</rs> to come to the court at South Warnborough to perform in an <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40453/" type="Drama_Type">interlude</rs> before the future Edward II and for <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/41121/" type="Thing_ClothingMaterials">fabric</rs> and wire to make <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/42274/" type="Thing_TheatricalCostume">costumes</rs> to be brought from London (see <ref target="https://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/collections/hamps/appendix-2/">Appendix 2</ref>).</p>
          <p>Three centuries later <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/11772/" type="Person_Royalty">Queen Elizabeth</rs> came to the same part of the county on progress in 1591, staying at Odiham before witnessing three days of pageantry at the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/144234/" type="Person_Nobility">earl of Hertford</rs>’s nearby residence at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/155529/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Elvetham</rs>. The earl had been imprisoned for treason thirty years earlier for secretly marrying Lady <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/144352/" type="Person_Nobility">Katherine Grey</rs> and was still trying to regain the queen’s favour. His principal residence was Tottenham Hall near Marlborough in Wiltshire but Elizabeth’s 1591 progress never ventured that far west, so Hertford was forced into extraordinary efforts to make the much smaller manor at Elvetham sufficiently impressive to ‘<quote source="#hamps-ridp224398640">shew his vnfained loue, and loyal duetie to her most gracious Highnesse</quote>.'<note type="foot">Davies, ‘Looking Again at Elvetham,' p 212; records of entertainments in Seymour’s Wiltshire residences will appear in REED's forthcoming <title>Wiltshire including Salisbury</title> collection, edited by C.

          <p><rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/17496/" type="Person_Royalty">King James</rs> too found entertainment in Hampshire when the court removed to Winchester in 1603 to escape plague in London. A Christmas entertainment for the court – variously called an ‘<rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40398/" type="Drama_Type">enterlude</rs>,' a ‘<rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40416/" type="Drama_Type">mask</rs>,' and ‘un <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/18451/" type="Entertainer_Type">ballet</rs>’ by witnesses from <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/222415/" type="Person_Nobility">Lady Arbella Stuart</rs> to the French Ambassador – seems not to have been a success. Arbella Stuart wrote that it was ‘ridiculous’ and that ‘the mistress of the revelles ... compelled [her] ... to play the childe agine.’<note type="foot">Longleat House: MS 112, vol 2, f 209v. The letter of the French ambassador, M de Villeroy, is BL: Add MS 30639, f 283v. These royal entertainments are also mentioned by Lady Anne Clifford in her diary, Centre for Kentish Studies: U269/F48/1, f 15, and by Sir Thomas Edmondes in a letter to the earl of Shrewsbury, Lambeth Palace Library: MS 3201, f 143. These records of royal entertainments do not appear in the Hampshire collection, but will appear in the collections associated with their authors; royal expense records are not included in REED collections.

          <p>A number of Hampshire aristocrats are known to have had connections to the drama but few have left records of performances at their residences in the county. Perhaps the best known is <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/83830/" type="Person_Nobility">Henry Wriothesley</rs>, fourth earl of Southampton, dedicatee of at least two of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/199852/" type="Person_Commoner">Shakespeare</rs>’s poems (<title>The Rape of Lucrece</title> and <title>Venus and Adonis</title>). Unfortunately no records of Southampton’s household have survived to tell us whether Shakespeare’s company – or any other players, for that matter – visited the earl at his Hampshire residences at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/107506/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Titchfield</rs> or <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/107568/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Beaulieu</rs>. Both manors were monastic houses given to Henry Wriothesley’s grandfather, Sir <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/121946/" type="Person_Nobility">Thomas Wriothesley</rs>, by Henry VIII at the Dissolution. In fact the only evidence of dramatic activity by the Wriothesley household in Hampshire comes from the very first year of Sir Thomas’ residence at Titchfield, when <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/140094/" type="Person_Nobility">Lady Wriothesley</rs> introduced herself to the local notables with ‘Cristmas pleys and mask<ex>es</ex>’ during the holiday season 1537–8.</p>
          <p>The Sandys family of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/157238/" type="Place_BoroughParish">The Vyne</rs>, near <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/123118/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Basingstoke</rs>, is another Hampshire family that has left no records of household entertainment, although the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/222585/" type="Collective_Troupe">players of William, Lord Sandys</rs> appeared at Bridgwater in 1593 and 1602 and at Exeter in 1600.<note type="foot">REED, <title>Patrons and Performances</title>, https://reed.library.utoronto.ca/node/316318.</note></p>
          <p>The <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/221085/" type="Person_Family">Paulet family</rs> of Basingstoke came to prominence when <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/172771/" type="Person_Nobility">William Paulet</rs> became lord treasurer under Henry VIII and retained that position through the reigns of Edward, Mary, and Elizabeth, until his death in 1572. Though no doubt he attended numerous court entertainments, the marquess of Winchester left no relevant household records nor have the other Paulets of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/123360/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Basing House</rs>. Sir Richard Paulet of Herriard and Freefolk has, however, provided us with a rich cache of records of dramatic and musical entertainment that he enjoyed at his Hampshire residences, in London, and at the households of others. Sir Richard, a grandson of the lord treasurer’s younger brother, became sheriff of the county and MP for Whitchurch from 1604 until his death in 1614. Paulet welcomed a variety of entertainers to his household, including <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/127860/" type="Entertainer_Type">maskers</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/134052/" type="Entertainer_Type">wassailers</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1243/" type="Entertainer_Type">musicians</rs>, a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/14146/" type="Drama_Character">lord of misrule</rs>, and even on <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/41680/" type="CalenderDay_Secular">New Year’s Day</rs> 1613 a ‘<quote source="#hamps-ridp223849344">minstrell mayde</quote>.' He also gave rewards to musicians on visits to other Hampshire gentry, while acting as a justice of the peace at both Winchester and Salisbury, and at Southampton when he was made a burgess. A diary that Paulet wrote in London for the parliament of 1610 mentions a number of court entertainments – a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40677/" type="Entertainment_Type">tilt</rs>, a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40416/" type="Drama_Type">masque</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/18451/" type="Entertainer_Type">dancing</rs>, and a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40453/" type="Drama_Type">play</rs> – which Paulet himself does not appear to have attended. He does describe in detail the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/42274/" type="Thing_TheatricalCostume">costumes</rs> of those involved in the tilt.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp223716960"/>.</note> Later he purchased the printed description of the creation of Prince Henry as Prince of Wales, which included the text of the masque, <title>Tethys Festival</title>, by Samuel Daniel. He also bought <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/70656/" type="Thing_BookPlayMusic">play texts</rs>, including <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/130684/" type="Person_Commoner">Middleton</rs>’s <title><rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/131038/" type="Drama_TitledWork">The Puritan, or the Widow of Watling Street</rs></title>.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp223636080"/>.</note> Paulet’s papers even include what appears to be part of an outline for a masque or <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/129826/" type="Drama_Type">morality play</rs> called ‘The Triumph of Love,’ in which a young prince named <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/168841/" type="Drama_Character">Philo</rs> is counselled by allegorical characters such as <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/169446/" type="Drama_Character">Reason</rs> and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/169417/" type="Drama_Character">Nature</rs>.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp223931760"/>.</note> Richard Paulet’s adopted son and heir, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/115534/" type="Person_Gentry">Sir Thomas Jervoise</rs>, seems to have preferred a narrower range of entertainment: he continued only the rewards to musicians, mainly when he was away from home.</p>
          <p>We also know a fair amount about household entertainments on the Isle of Wight in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, thanks to the detailed notebooks of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/98105/" type="Person_Gentry">Sir John Oglander</rs>. We do have to distinguish carefully between Oglander’s accounts of events at which he himself was present and the stories he relates of entertainments that actually occurred before he was born. The former include a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/214969/" type="Entertainer_Type">puppet play</rs> his family saw at Newport in 1630 and a gathering of the Isle’s gentry for <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1243/" type="Entertainer_Type">music</rs> and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/18451/" type="Entertainer_Type">dancing</rs> at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/97865/" type="Person_Commoner">Thomas Urry</rs>’s <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/167109/" type="Place_Feature">house</rs> at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/124384/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Thorley</rs> in 1631.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp223223648"/> and <ptr target="#hamps-ridp223242496"/>.</note> On the other hand, Oglander’s story of elaborate pageantry that went comically wrong is almost certainly hearsay. The story claims to describe the celebration of the appointment of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/116753/" type="Person_Nobility">Sir George Carey</rs>, long the captain of the Isle of Wight, to be lord chamberlain of the queen’s household in 1596, when Oglander himself was only eleven.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp223286224"/>.</note></p>

          <p>Hampshire is particularly rich in records of the visits of travelling entertainers, partly due to the county’s relative proximity to London and the well-travelled road between London and the port of Southampton, but also due to the fortunate survival of manuscript records. Winchester, Winchester College, and Southampton all have financial accounting records that stretch back as far as the mid-fourteenth century and visiting minstrels appear in many of the earliest. The first recorded payment to travelling performers by the city of Winchester was made in 1377–8, by Winchester College in 1410–11, and by Southampton in 1428–9.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp245298176"/>, <ptr target="#hamps-ridp241575872"/>, and <ptr target="#hamps-ridp225012208"/>.</note> Each place paid at least one travelling troupe in most years from the early fifteenth century until the early seventeenth. Even earlier records come from monastic institutions. The two surviving receiver’s accounts of St Swithun’s Priory record payments to unidentified minstrels in 1334–5 and 1337.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp240125136"/> and <ptr target="#hamps-ridp240145920"/>.</note> Southwick Priory rewarded the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/32482/" type="Collective_Troupe">minstrels of King Richard II</rs> and those of the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/90390/" type="Collective_Title">earls of Kent</rs> and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/24172/" type="Collective_Title">Arundel</rs> between 1391 and 1394.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp225450400"/>, <ptr target="#hamps-ridp225223136"/>, and <ptr target="#hamps-ridp224925424"/>.</note> <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/106916/" type="Place_Feature">St Cross Hospital</rs> outside Winchester saw four different groups of minstrels and players in 1409–10.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp240158464"/>.</note></p>
          <p>The terms used in the records make it difficult to know exactly what sort of performances occurred in most cases. Occasionally a performer will be identified specifically as a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1162/" type="Entertainer_Type">piper</rs>, a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/26727/" type="Entertainer_Type">tumbler</rs>, or a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/21804/" type="Entertainer_Type">bearward</rs> (or their Latin equivalents), but before the Reformation most of the performers were called <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/8709/" type="Entertainer_Type">minstrels</rs>. Southampton’s accounts, in English from 1440, use ‘minstrels’ and the chamberlains of Winchester and bursars of Winchester College ‘ministralli,’ while the college hall books use ‘mimi’ for what appear to be the same performers. Occasionally, one of the college bursars uses both ‘ministralli’ and ‘mimi’ for different troupes in the same year, giving the impression he is differentiating between kinds of performers (see <ptr target="#hamps-ridp242350688"/>, for example), but he may just be using the terms interchangeably, like the 1459–60 bursar’s accounts that identify the earl of Arundel’s performers as ‘<quote source="#hamps-ridp242214432">mimis s<ex>i</ex>u<ex>e</ex> ministrall<ex>is</ex></quote>.' Only at the end of the fifteenth century and beginning of the sixteenth do more definite distinctions appear to be made between minstrels and musicians on the one hand and actors on the other. The latter are called ‘stage players’ or simply ‘players’ in English, while the Latin accounts seem to be searching for the right term for this new phenomenon, trying ‘interludentes’ and ‘lusores’ as well as the classical ‘histriones.’</p>
          <p>Players became the dominant type of travelling performer in the second half of the sixteenth century, only to decline in numbers in the seventeenth, all but disappearing by the late 1630s. Most of the itinerant entertainers are identified in the records by their royal and aristocratic patrons. As in most parts of the country, the royal minstrels and players showed up the most often; performers of every monarch from <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/32403/" type="Person_Royalty">Richard II</rs> to <rs ref="https://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/24537/" type="Person_Royalty">Charles I</rs> came to Hampshire. The performers of the successive <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/24172/" type="Collective_Title">earls of Arundel</rs> came nearly as frequently, in fact outnumbering visits by royal performers to Winchester College and Southampton from the mid-fifteenth century through the first quarter of the sixteenth. The earls owned lands in Hampshire and held many offices there, including justice of the peace for Southampton and warden of the New Forest. The <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/125079/" type="Collective_Troupe">minstrels of Henry, Cardinal Beaufort</rs>, were rewarded frequently during his tenure as <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/154663/" type="Collective_Office">bishop of Winchester</rs> (1404–47) – four times by Winchester, five by Southampton, and seventeen times by Winchester College.</p>
          <p>One puzzling early record may represent a visiting performer enlisting some locals to perform with him. A dispute in Winchester city court in 1409 concerned four men who claimed they had been recruited to play a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/158317/" type="Drama_Character">steward</rs>, a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/158358/" type="Drama_Character">torturer</rs>, and two <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/128431/" type="Drama_Character">knights</rs> in a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40380/" type="Drama_Type">play</rs> of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/158693/" type="Drama_TitledWork">St Agnes</rs> (‘<quote source="#hamps-ridp245582192">ludo vocat<ex>o</ex> pleye of synt agnes</quote>’) by a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/158073/" type="Person_Commoner">Richard Syngere</rs>. Syngere had promised to provide the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/42274/" type="Thing_TheatricalCostume">costumes</rs> and props and the four expected to profit from taking part in the performance. When Syngere failed to keep his side of the bargain, the four broke into his lodgings and stole the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/70656/" type="Thing_BookPlayMusic">text of the play</rs> and a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/159180/" type="Thing_SetMachinery">playing cloth</rs> – perhaps a backdrop or ground cloth (‘vnu<ex>m</ex> originale s<ex>an</ex>c<ex>t</ex>e Agnet<ex>is</ex> &amp; vnu<ex>m</ex> pannu<ex>m</ex> vocat<ex>um</ex> pleyngcloþ’). The court records do not tell how the case was decided and much about it is unclear, but several points stand out. The four men all appear elsewhere in the Winchester records but Syngere does not, so he may have been a visitor to the town. The play was to be performed on 16 July, not at all connected to St Agnes’ feast day, 21 January, but likely timed to catch the crowds who visited Winchester for the feast of the cathedral’s patron saint, St Swithun, a day earlier on the fifteenth. Moreover, the list of roles to be played by the four men do not include several of the most important characters in the story of St Agnes. So Syngere may have been a visiting player who came to Winchester to make some money at St Swithun’s Day, perhaps accompanied by other players who would have taken the more important roles, recruiting locals for the minor parts.<note type="foot">For a fuller discussion of this play, see Cowling, ‘Fifteenth-Century Saint Play,' pp 19–33.</note></p>
          <p>Of particular interest in the Southampton records are four licences to playing companies that were copied into the town’s ‘Books of Instruments.' In 1591 two licences were copied – one for <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/175683/" type="Collective_Troupe">Lord Beauchamp’s players</rs> and the other for <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/180666/" type="Person_Commoner">John</rs> and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/180596/" type="Person_Commoner">Laurence Dutton</rs>, who were <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/17169/" type="Collective_Troupe">players of the queen</rs> leading a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/213222/" type="Collective_Troupe">group of boys</rs>.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp228186944"/>.</note> The motive for copying these licences is uncertain, as players had been required to carry such licences – or risk arrest as vagabonds – at least since the  <title>Acte for the punishement of Vacabondes and for Relief of the Poore &amp; Impotent</title> was issued in 1572. The licences were granted by <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/131827/" type="Person_Gentry">Edmund Tilney</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/61914/" type="Collective_Office">master of the revels</rs>, rather than by the players’ own patrons and Tilney asserted that many troupes of actors were touring the country pretending to have noble patrons to the great detriment of the country. That may have been the usual rhetoric of such documents, but if there was indeed an epidemic of players on the road without licences, the authorities at Southampton might have wished to record Tilney’s language that gave them authority to refuse permission to play to any company that could not show such a licence.</p>
          <p>The licence from the privy council to <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/153197/" type="Collective_Troupe">Lord Strange’s men</rs> in 1593 has long been known to scholars and its interest to the town was no doubt in its reference to the plague at London that prevented Strange’s company from playing within seven miles of the capital.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp228261600"/>.</note> An additional motive for copying licences and this one in particular would be so the mayor could prove he was obligated to allow these actors to perform, in case anything went wrong (such as plague breaking out in Southampton) and the mayor’s judgment was challenged. The 1606 licence to <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/17474/" type="Collective_Troupe">Queen Anne’s players</rs> may have been copied because the mayor doubted its legitimacy – as have modern scholars.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp228556560"/>.</note>  Of the three actors named, only <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/187340/" type="Person_Commoner">Robert Lee</rs> was named in the patent that created Queen Anne’s company in 1603, and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/24813/" type="Person_Commoner">Martin Slater</rs> was a rather doubtful character who was caught travelling with a fake or duplicate licence in 1616. (In 1616 Martin Slater appeared before the mayor of Norwich with a licence for Queen Anne’s players that named – among others – <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/222656/" type="Person_Commoner">Thomas Greene</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/23345/" type="Person_Commoner">Thomas Swynnerton</rs>, and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/222762/" type="Person_Commoner">Christopher Beeston</rs>, but not Slater. The Norwich authorities noted that they had already seen this licence (or its twin) in the hands of Swynnerton and since Slater was not named, they denied him permission to play in the city. <note type="foot">David Galloway (ed), <title>Norwich 1540–1642</title>, REED (Toronto, Buffalo, and London), 148.</note> Slater appears to have been a marginal figure who moved from company to company, having been a member of the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/25827/" type="Collective_Troupe">admiral’s men</rs> in 1597 and of Hertford’s in 1603, while in 1608 he was leading the boys of the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/25046/" type="Collective_Troupe">king’s revels company</rs>.<note type="foot">Mark Eccles, ‘Elizabethan Actors IV: S to End,’ <title>Notes and Queries</title> 40.2 (June 1993), 169–72).</note></p>
          <p>A major attraction of these licences is that they name the principal actors in each of the companies. None of the actors in Lord Beauchamp’s company achieved prominence, but the Dutton brothers were active in important companies for several decades and Lord Strange’s troupe brought together some of the best-known actors of the time. <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/153045/" type="Person_Commoner">Edward Alleyn</rs> had been and would shortly again become the star of the lord admiral’s men, while <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/132129/" type="Person_Commoner">Kempe</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/186736/" type="Person_Commoner">Pope</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/187097/" type="Person_Commoner">Hemminges</rs>, and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/213996/" type="Person_Commoner">Phillips</rs> would join <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/199852/" type="Person_Commoner">Shakespeare</rs> and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/199997/" type="Person_Commoner">Richard Burbage</rs> in the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/223085/" type="Collective_Troupe">lord chamberlain’s men</rs>.</p>
          <p>Beauchamp’s players did have a Hampshire connection, as their patron was <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/130875/" type="Person_Nobility">Edward Seymour</rs>, son of the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/144234/" type="Person_Nobility">Edward Seymour</rs> who was <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/30047/" type="Collective_Title">earl of Hertford</rs> and who entertained <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/11772/" type="Person_Royalty">Queen Elizabeth</rs> with lavish pageantry at his house at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/155529/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Elvetham</rs> in the northeast corner of the county in the same year that the son’s players had their licence copied at Southampton.<note type="foot"> See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp224398640"/>.</note> Beauchamp’s principal residence was at Tottenham Hall in Wiltshire, but if we were to consider him a Hampshire man, he would have the most frequently attested performers of any Hampshire patron. Lord Beauchamp’s players are recorded at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/73838/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Norwich</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/37840/" type="Place_BoroughParish">York</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/123250/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Gloucester</rs>, and the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/2039/" type="Place_County">Kent</rs> ports, as well as at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/72712/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Southampton</rs>, in the early 1590s. Performers with patrons whose principal residence was in Hampshire appear to have been relatively rare despite the prominence of some county nobility in the nation’s affairs in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/223131/" type="Collective_Troupe">Minstrels of Thomas Wriothesley</rs>, the second earl of Southampton, turn up in the records of Dover and Chichester in 1543–4, but the patronage of Shakespeare by the fourth earl, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/83830/" type="Person_Nobility">Henry Wriothesley</rs>, does not appear to have extended to travelling performers; there is only a single record of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/223158/" type="Collective_Troupe">his trumpeters</rs> in 1599–1600 at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/111759/" type="Place_Feature">Magdalen College</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/39267/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Oxford</rs>. <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/172771/" type="Person_Nobility">William Paulet</rs>, first marquess of Winchester, was lord treasurer to three monarchs but only a single payment to his players at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/73473/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Cambridge</rs> in 1551–2 indicates he was a patron of drama. The three recorded appearances of the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/222585/" type="Collective_Troupe">players of Baron Sandys of the Vyne</rs> – at Bridgwater in 1593 and 1602 and at Exeter in 1599–1600 – are the most yet known for any Hampshire patron.<note type="foot">See REED, <title>Patrons and Performances</title>, https://reed.library.utoronto.ca/node/316318.</note></p>
          <p>Bearwards visited Hampshire, though less often than minstrels or players. The earliest record of a bearward was a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/159852/" type="Collective_Troupe">bearward of George, duke of Clarence</rs>, who appeared in Southampton in 1469–70<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp225891376"/>.</note> and multiple times at Winchester and Winchester College in the early 1470s – as did the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/178769/" type="Collective_Troupe">earl of Warwick’s bearward.</rs> Visits to Winchester were rare in the sixteenth century but Southampton saw bearwards every year or two, with the royal bearwards the most frequent visitors: <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/166270/" type="Collective_Troupe">Henry VIII’s bearward</rs> came to Southampton almost annually from 1512 to 1530 and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/12915/" type="Collective_Troupe">Queen Elizabeth’s</rs> came four times in the 1580s. The <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/167529/" type="Collective_Troupe">bearward of Charles Brandon, duke of Suffolk</rs>, entertained the town five times in the 1520s. The latest record of a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/175656/" type="Collective_Troupe">bearward was one whose patron was Lord Chandos</rs>, who visited Southampton in 1586–7.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp227820528"/>.</note></p>
          <p>A much earlier but perhaps related kind of entertainment is suggested by an entry in the Winchester pipe roll for 1265–6: ‘<quote source="#hamps-ridp220289616">Et xii .d. p<ex>ro</ex> urso passand<ex>o</ex> ad Comitissa<ex>m</ex></quote>.' It seems a bear was being taken to a countess, or perhaps ferried to her, since the payment is in the accounts for the manor of Bitterne, on the River Itchen just east of Southampton, and the countess was probably <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/85068/" type="Person_Nobility">Isabella de Fortibus</rs>, dowager countess of Devon and Albemarle (July 1237–10 November 1293), who lived at Carisbrooke Castle and styled herself ‘Lady of the Isle of Wight.' Bearwards with performing bears are not known to have appeared as itinerant performers this early, but the bear might have been <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40835/" type="Entertainment_AnimalSport">displayed</rs> as a rarity, like the polar bear that was part of the royal menagerie in the Tower.<note type="foot">Phillip Drennon Thomas, ‘The Tower of London’s Royal Menagerie,' <title>History Today</title> 46.8 (August 1996), 29–35; Nicholas Vincent, ‘Politics of Church and State,’ pp 157–87.</note></p>
          <p>One intriguing record shows that many itinerant performers needed to offer a variety of entertainments in order to survive. In 1578–9 Southampton rewarded a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/113765/" type="Collective_Troupe">troupe</rs> under the patronage of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/113649/" type="Person_Gentry">Sir Matthew Arundel</rs> ‘<quote source="#hamps-ridp227659280">for shewing pastime w<ex>i</ex>th their beares &amp; plaing that nighte w<ex>i</ex>th their poppett<ex>es</ex></quote>.' Other <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/214969/" type="Entertainer_Type">puppet players</rs> toured through the county, notably the troupe led by <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/119792/" type="Person_Commoner">William Sands</rs> in the 1620s, which had twelve puppeteers and performed an elaborate <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40362/" type="Drama_Type">biblical play</rs> called '<rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/119545/" type="Drama_TitledWork">the Chaos</rs>.' Despite the fact that they had been licensed by the master of the revels in 1623, the Sands puppet players were turned away from Newport in 1628–9 due to fear of smallpox.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp222887952"/>.

The accounts for 1518–19, 1521–2, 1523–4, 1524–5, and 1528–9 speak only of the king’s juggler, but we know from records of a number of other towns that the king’s juggler in those years was indeed Thomas Brandon.<note type="foot">See <ref target="https://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/entities/166322/">Thomas Brandon</ref>.</note> His travels led him along the south coast from Kent and Sussex, through Hampshire and west all the way to Devon and Cornwall, and also included Worcester, Shrewsbury, Oxford, Cambridge, and East Anglia – once even Thetford Priory.<note type="foot">See REED, <title>Patrons and Performances</title>, https://reed.library.utoronto.ca/; David Galloway and John Wasson (eds) <title>Collections</title> 11 (Oxford, 1980), 110–14, 182.</note> It is perhaps surprising then that Brandon does not appear in the Winchester city records, given Winchester’s close ties to royalty, and he shows up only once – as ‘ioculatori reg<ex>is</ex>’ in 1520–1 – in the bursars’ accounts of Winchester College. One of Brandon’s ‘tricks,' making a pigeon die on cue, is described at length in Reginald Scot’s 1584 <title>Discouerie of Witchcraft</title> and Philip Butterworth argues convincingly that Brandon’s performances involved much more conjuring than what we think of as juggling.<note type="foot"><title>Magic on the Early English Stage</title> (Cambridge, 2005), 9–14.

The 1563–4 visit of the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/174549/" type="Collective_Troupe">queen’s juggler</rs> to Southampton was a successor of Brandon’s called ‘Stanney’ or, as he is identified in the Gloucester records of the same year, ‘<rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/223198/" type="Person_Commoner">Stanweye</rs> the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/174549/" type="Collective_Troupe">Quenes Iugler</rs>.'<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp226732560"/>, and Audrey Douglas and Peter Greenfield (eds), <title>Cumberland / Westmorland / Gloucestershire</title>, REED (Toronto, Buffalo, and London, 1986), 299.</note></p>
          <p><rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/14164/" type="Entertainer_Type">Jesters</rs> also included Hampshire in their itineraries. The <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/173024/" type="Collective_Troupe">king’s jester</rs> rewarded by Southampton in 1550–1 was identified elsewhere as one <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/223254/" type="Person_Commoner">James Lockwood</rs>.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp227425952"/>.</note> He continued in the position of royal jester under Queen Mary and into the reign of Queen Elizabeth.<note type="foot">John Southworth, <title>Fools and Jesters at the English Court</title> (Stroud, Glos, 1998), 98–9.</note> However, the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/173175/" type="Collective_Troupe">Queen’s jester</rs> rewarded by Southampton in 1554–5 is identified in the accounts as ‘<quote source="#hamps-ridp227436912"><rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/173198/" type="Person_Commoner">Mr Ren<ex>er</ex>d</rs></quote>.' ‘Renerd’ suggests the character Reynard the Fox of Continental fables, a trickster figure and thus an appropriate name for a jester, or a persona that Lockwood (or someone else) took on for his performance rather than the jester’s own name. Another possibility is that ‘Mr Ren<ex>er</ex>d’ was in fact <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/223358/" type="Collective_Troupe">King Philip’s jester</rs> rather than Queen Mary’s, as Mary's marriage to Philip of Spain took place on 25 July 1554 at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/107876/" type="Place_Feature">Winchester Cathedral</rs> and her jester appeared with Philip’s jester at Canterbury and Faversham in 1554–5.<note type="foot">Gibson (ed), <title>Kent</title>,  vol 1, p 174; vol 2, p 545.</note> In 1623 when <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/24537/" type="Person_Royalty">Prince Charles</rs> waited at Portsmouth for favourable winds to sail to Spain, his considerable entourage included the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/161898/" type="Collective_Troupe">king’s fool</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/126416/" type="Person_Commoner">Archibald Armstrong</rs>.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp223309136"/>.</note></p>
          <p>We can guess that itinerant performers also visited the houses of Hampshire aristocrats, although the surviving evidence is skimpy. Performing in a household, especially of a major noble like one of the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/83892/" type="Collective_Title">earls of Southampton</rs> at Titchfield, or the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/118434/" type="Collective_Title">marquess of Winchester</rs> at Basing, or the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/174597/" type="Collective_Title">Lords Sandys of The Vyne</rs>, was usually a better deal than performing in a town like Winchester or Southampton. Not only did nobles often give larger rewards than towns, but the players would have been fed and lodged in the household, greatly reducing their expenses. People have often assumed that Shakespeare and his fellow players in the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/223085/ http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/127834/" type="Collective_Troupe">lord chamberlain’s men</rs>, later the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/17717/" type="Collective_Troupe">king’s men</rs>, would have travelled to Titchfield to perform for Shakespeare’s patron, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/83830/" type="Person_Nobility">Henry Wriothesley</rs>, fourth earl of Southampton, but no records of Wriothesley’s household have survived to support the assumption.</p>
          <p>The one household for which we do have extensive records is that of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/113645/" type="Person_Gentry">Sir Richard Paulet</rs> (cousin of the marquess of Winchester) and his adopted son, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/115534/" type="Person_Gentry">Sir Thomas Jervoise</rs>, at Freefolk and Herriard. Both Paulet and later Jervoise tended to reward entertainers more often when they themselves were travelling rather than when they were at home, for reasons that may have been mainly monetary. Neither man was lavish with rewards. The 5s Paulet gave to <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/131100/" type="Collective_Troupe">Lord Beauchamp’s musicians</rs> in 1609 was much the largest payment either gave to visiting entertainers; many received less than a shilling.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp223669376"/>.</note> Detouring four miles to Herriard from the main road at Basingstoke may not have seemed worth the trouble. Freefolk, on the other hand, was the residence both men seem to have preferred, and it lay just off the road that led from London through Basingstoke, Whitchurch, and Andover to Salisbury and further west – making it a logical stop for <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/134520/" type="Collective_Troupe">Sir Thomas Thynne’s musicians</rs> on their way from Longleat House to London in 1615.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp222471696"/>.</note> The most intriguing record of performers visiting Paulet and Jervoise is the earliest, a poem sent to Paulet in 1586 by six men with French names who offer to visit Paulet, labelled (perhaps by Paulet himself) ‘The Maskers l<ex>et</ex>tre.'<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp223495616"/>.</note> Paulet gave rewards to visiting musicians several times between 1586 and his death in 1614. He attended <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40453/" type="Drama_Type">plays</rs> in London and bought <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/70656/" type="Thing_BookPlayMusic">play books</rs> but the extant records yield no evidence of players visiting Paulet in Hampshire. Jervoise received Sir Thomas Thynne’s musicians at Freefolk in 1615 shortly after he inherited the estate, but after that he rewarded entertainers only when serving as a justice at Salisbury or when visiting his estates in Shropshire.</p>
          <p>Entertainers travelling through Hampshire used a few likely routes. An obvious one led from London southwest to Winchester, then south to Southampton before turning either east or west. Records of southeastern ports like Dover and Rye link up well with Southampton’s to show that many travellers followed a loop out from London to Southampton and then turned east along the south coastal road that led to Chichester, Arundel, Rye, and the Kent ports.<note type="foot">Stenton, <title>'Road System'</title>, pp 7–11; Greenfield, 'Touring,' pp 301–2.</note> Some travelled further west, to Salisbury, Poole, Dorchester, Lyme, Exeter, Plymouth, and Barnstaple before bending northwards toward Bristol, Coventry, and in rare cases as far north as Carlisle.<note type="foot">See REED, <title>Patrons and Performances</title>, https://reed.library.utoronto.ca/.</note> The Sands family of puppet players travelled all the way from their base in Preston, Lancashire, to perform their play of biblical episodes called 'the Chaos' on the Isle of Wight in 1628 and 1630.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp222887952"/>. David George, ‘Anti-Catholic Plays, Puppet Shows, and Horse-Racing in Reformation Lancashire,’ <title>REED Newsletter</title> 19.1 (1994), 16–19; David George (ed), <title>Lancashire</title>, REED (Toronto, Buffalo, and London, 1991), 87.</note> In 1487–8, a rare year when the accountants of both Winchester College and Southampton provided precise dates for performers’ visits, the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/163866/" type="Collective_Troupe">minstrels of King Henry VII</rs>, the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/163892/" type="Collective_Troupe">queen</rs>, and the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/159878/" type="Collective_Troupe">earl of Arundel</rs> were all paid at the college and then a few days later at Southampton.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp226255984"/> and <ptr target="#hamps-ridp242870592"/>.</note> The <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/163457/" type="Collective_Troupe">earl of Derby’s minstrels</rs>, however, received a reward from the college on 18 January, but must have travelled elsewhere before they reached Southampton six months later on 16 July. Not every travelling troupe visited both towns and the college on the same trip. Southampton rewarded many more entertainers than either of the Winchester venues, no doubt due to the port’s better access. After 1400 the main road linking London to Southampton passed a few miles east of Winchester and the cathedral city’s declining financial fortunes must have meant that travellers did not anticipate making enough in the city to balance the extra effort to get there.</p>
          <p>Hampshire’s receptiveness to visiting performers in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries had waned by the early years of the seventeenth. Winchester College’s records show that plays performed by the scholars themselves became more popular than those of itinerant actors, who were last rewarded in 1570–1.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp243874064"/>.</note> Southampton still gave occasional rewards to travelling companies at the beginning of the seventeenth century, though the number had decreased to only one or two a year. Then a prohibition against allowing ‘<quote source="#hamps-ridp229158000">Stage players to acte their enterludes</quote>’ in the town hall was issued in 1620 (reiterated in 1624) and the only payments to visitors recorded during the 1620s and 1630s were to leave town without playing. Even royalist Winchester rewarded no players after 1623–4 and a 1617 Star Chamber case over players performing in a church on a Sunday afternoon reveals the growing tension between traditionalists and zealous reformers in the civic leadership.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp244572080"/> and <ptr target="#hamps-ridp248262848"/>.</note> On the Isle of Wight visiting entertainers were welcomed somewhat longer, despite Sir John Oglander’s complaints about the disappearance of traditional seasonal festivities. The <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/25345/" type="Collective_Troupe">prince’s players</rs> were allowed to play in Newport in 1624 and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/214969/" type="Entertainer_Type">puppet players</rs> in 1630, though the latter had been turned away in 1628 due to fear of the pox.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp222853200"/>, <ptr target="#hamps-ridp223223648"/>, and <ptr target="#hamps-ridp222887952"/>.</note></p>

          <head>Playing Places</head>
          <p>The surviving records tell us little about many of the places where dramatic and musical activity took place in the county but we are fortunate that two playing places still exist in much the form they had in the late medieval and early modern period: the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/106630/" type="Place_Feature">hall</rs> above the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/106652/" type="Place_Feature">Bargate</rs> in Southampton and the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/106850/" type="Place_Feature">hall</rs> of Winchester College. A third may perhaps be the choir of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/107876/" type="Place_Feature">Winchester Cathedral</rs>, for the <title>Visitatio Sepulchri</title> performed by the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/27258/" type="Collective_ClergyAndChurchwardens">monks</rs> of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/107330/" type="Place_ReligiousHouse">St Swithun’s Priory</rs> on <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/41327/" type="CalendarDay_Liturgical">Easter</rs> morning would have happened there. The priory’s <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/21537/" type="Drama_Character">boy bishop</rs> would also have gone in procession into the cathedral to deliver his sermon, though any <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40561/" type="Entertainment_Type">feasting</rs> or other revelry attached to the boy bishop celebration would have occurred elsewhere, in monastic buildings that disappeared at the Dissolution.</p>
          <p>Traditional seasonal festivities happened in a variety of spaces. The death at a 1381 <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/35779/ http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40561/" type="Entertainment_SeasonalCustom">king ale</rs> at Andover occurred in the ‘<quote source="#hamps-ridp219992864">alto vico</quote>’ (high street). Some parishes had structures designated by their use in such seasonal festivities, though we know nothing more about them: <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/107385/" type="Place_BoroughParish">St John’s</rs> Winchester had a ‘<rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/167086/" type="Place_Feature">somerloge</rs>’ in the 1550s and a 1614 Star Chamber case from <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/79210/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Alton</rs> describes men dancing at a place called the ‘<rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/126997/" type="Place_Feature">somer howse</rs>.'<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp248553248"/> and <ptr target="#hamps-ridp219637536"/>.</note> <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/98105/" type="Person_Gentry">Sir John Oglander</rs> describes places in <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/126758/" type="Place_Feature">Parkhurst Forest</rs> on the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/2363/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Isle of Wight</rs> where the youth of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/87076/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Newport</rs> celebrated <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/41230/" type="CalenderDay_Secular">May Day</rs>, as well as where an elaborate entertainment celebrated Sir George Carey’s 1596 departure from the island to succeed his father as lord chamberlain of the queen’s household.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp223286224"/>.</note> Oglander does not tell us anything about performances in his own household at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/124340/" type="Place_Feature">Nunwell House</rs> but does describe the island gentry dancing at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/167109/" type="Place_Feature">Thorley House</rs> near <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/124362/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Yarmouth</rs> and ‘<quote source="#hamps-ridp223242496">to ye foote of ye hill</quote>’ from <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/124296/" type="Place_Feature">Haseley House</rs>, which still exists just south of Newport and claims to be the oldest house on the Isle of Wight.</p>
          <p>Private performances could of course happen anywhere, as in the case of the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1243/" type="Entertainer_Type">musicians</rs> rewarded by <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/113645/" type="Person_Gentry">Sir Richard Paulet</rs> in the Southampton houses of his cousin <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/130307/" type="Person_Gentry">Thomas Lambert</rs>, the town recorder <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/121789/" type="Person_Gentry">Thomas Fleming</rs>, and former mayor <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/130388/" type="Person_Commoner">Richard Beiston</rs>, and a few payments in Southampton’s mayor's accounts are for entertainments in the mayor’s own house or those of other local dignitaries. However, nearly all the performances recorded in civic accounts – whether by visiting performers or by groups like the musicians or waits that both Southampton and Winchester employed – took place in the town halls. Newport’s <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/124241/" type="Place_Feature">town hall</rs>, for instance, was the venue for players like Gilbert Reason and his fellows in 1624. Already called the ‘<quote source="#hamps-ridp222853200">old towne hall</quote>’ then, it is long gone but stood where the later guildhall stands, at the junction of High Street and Quay Street.<note type="foot"><title>VCH: Hampshire</title>, vol 5, pp 253–265, <title>British History Online</title>, http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/hants/vol5/pp253-265 [accessed 11 May 2019].</note></p>
          <p>In Southampton’s records the town hall or guildhall is identified as the hall over the Bargate, where the town council met, and it still stands today in the middle of the High Street.<note type="foot">See, for example, SCA: SC5/1/6, and also <title>VCH: Hampshire</title>, vol 2, p 497</note>. The Bargate is a sturdy stone structure that originally spanned the main entrance through the town walls from the north. John Leland described the Bargate around 1540 as ‘large and well embatelid. In the upper parte of this gate is domus civica [town-hall]: and undernethe is the toun prison.’<note type="foot">Douch, <title>Visitors’ Descriptions</title>, p 6.</note> The hall on the upper floor of the Bargate is 51 feet long (east to west) and 50 feet wide (north to south) at its widest point, but narrowing to 32 feet at either end. The entrance to the hall is at the east end, roughly in the middle of the east wall. The light comes mainly from four windows in the south wall.<note type="foot">P.A, Faulkner, ‘The Surviving Medieval Buildings,' <title>Excavations in Medieval Southampton 1953–1969</title>, Colin Platt and Richard Coleman-Smith (eds) (Leicester, 1975), 59, fig 8.</note> In 1620 the court leet ordered that the hall be cleaned and its tables and benches repaired, the damage having been ‘<quote source="#hamps-ridp229158000">Cheifelie occasioned by the sufferinge of Stage <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/8782/" type="Entertainer_Type">players</rs> to acte their <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40453/" type="Drama_Type">enterludes</rs> ther, w<ex>hi</ex>ch draweth greate Concourse of disordered people bothe by daie and nighte</quote>.' That the town hall was the site of public performances and not just performances exclusively for the mayor and council is confirmed by an order in the assembly book, which holds that allowing players to ‘<quote source="#hamps-ridp228845712">Act and repr<ex>e</ex>sent theire Interludes playes and shewes in the townehall</quote>’ is still causing problems, chiefly that <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/45558/" type="CrimesMisdemeanors">tables and benches were being broken</rs>, preventing the mayor and council from comfortably conducting the business of the daily piepowder court.</p>
          <p>Players may also have performed in some of the inns in the town. The 1620 court leet order provides that ‘<quote source="#hamps-ridp229158000">yf anie suche stage Or <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/214969/" type="Entertainer_Type">poppett plaiers</rs> must be admitted in this towne That they p<ex>ro</ex>vide their places for their representacions in their Innes or el<damage><gap unit="chars" extent="2"/></damage> where they can best p<ex>ro</ex>vide</quote>’ – rather than in the town hall. The only record placing players at an inn dates from almost a century earlier, however. In 1539 the steward paid 6s 8d ‘<quote source="#hamps-ridp226638448">to the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/69534/" type="Collective_Troupe">kynges pleyers</rs> at the dolffyne which pleyd nott</quote>.' The <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/122780/" type="Place_Feature">Dolphin Inn</rs> stood just north of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/122643/" type="Place_Feature">Holy Rood Church</rs> in the High Street, where a more recent structure with the same name stands today. However, since the record indicates that the king’s players ‘pleyd nott,' they may only have been staying at the Dolphin and not performing there.</p>
          <p>The city of Winchester had several halls and it is not clear from the records which one was being used in many cases. The great hall of Winchester Castle was reserved for the use of royalty and their visitors and never used for civic functions. Those instead took place in the hall of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/111737/" type="Place_Feature">St John’s Hospital</rs>. <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/8709/" type="Entertainer_Type">Minstrels</rs> performed there on <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/41497/" type="CalendarDay_Liturgical">Corpus Christi</rs> and the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/41188/" type="CalendarDay_Liturgical">Nativity of St John the Baptist</rs> for <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40561/" type="Entertainment_Type">feasts</rs> held by the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/154325/" type="Collective_GuildReligious">fraternity of St John</rs>, an organization made up of the city’s ruling elite. The burghmote, Winchester’s assembly of freemen, met three times a year in the hall of St John’s, rather than in the smaller guildhall, and in the fifteenth century the city’s deeds and other records were kept in a chest there. Some the medieval buildings of St John’s Hospital survive, on the north side of the High Street, just inside the East Gate. The main building held two infirmaries on the ground floor with the hall on the floor above; at the east end were two chapels, only one of which remains.<note type="foot">Keene and Rumble, <title>Medieval Winchester</title>, vol 2, pts 2–3, pp 819–20.</note></p>
                <p>The mayor and bailiffs met in several different spaces before 1361, when city administration moved to a building on the south side of the High Street where Calpe Street (now St Thomas Street) runs into the High Street, with Calpe Street on its west side and the White Hart Inn the major tenement on the east. The ground floor along the High Street comprised six shops, with a tavern in the cellar below. In 1361 the mayor paid £16 6s 8d for work to convert the upper floor into the new ‘hall of pleas’ ('nova aula plasitorum'). The hall was later also known as the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/107363/" type="Place_Feature">common hall</rs> ('aula communis') and in the fifteenth century as 'le Motehall,' 'le Tounehall,’ and the guildhall. The new hall offered a larger space for performances than earlier guildhalls but since the building as a whole was no more than 55 feet in length, the guildhall remained smaller than the hall of St John’s Hospital.<note type="foot">Keene and Rumble, <title>Medieval Winchester</title>, vol 1, pt 1, pp 82–3; vol 2, pts 2–3, pp 603–4.</note></p>
                  <p>At <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/106806/" type="Place_Feature">Winchester College</rs> performances took place in the college hall that still stands today. The building was part of the earliest construction at the college, with the instructional space (‘School’) on the ground floor and the hall on the upper floor, with dimensions of 63 feet by 30 feet.<note type="foot">Kirby, <title>Annals of Winchester College</title>, p 42.</note> The many performances by visiting minstrels probably occurred with the hall set as usual for meals, but in the late sixteenth century the bursars spent considerable funds for the construction of what they termed 'theatrum' and 'scena' for the plays acted by the scholars. In 1589–90 the bursars paid for <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/73078/" type="Thing_SetMachinery">wood</rs> and 1,200 <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/73151/" type="Thing_SetMachinery">nails</rs> and for two carpenters to construct a theatre ('<quote source="#hamps-ridp244017520">p<ex>ro</ex> theatro</quote>'). In 1573–4 '<quote source="#hamps-ridp243891888">scaffolda<ex>m</ex></quote>' were built for three nights of comedies and tragedies, which may refer to a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/72682/" type="Thing_SetMachinery">stage</rs> or scenery or to bleacher-style seating for the audience. Given Winchester College’s connection with New College, Oxford, the stages and seating for performances at Winchester may have resembled those constructed at Oxford and Cambridge in the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries.<note type="foot">See, for example, John R. Elliot et al (eds), <title>Oxford</title>, vol 2, REED (Toronto and Buffalo, 2004), 608–9; and Alan H. Nelson (ed), <title>Cambridge</title>, vol 2 (Toronto, Buffalo, and London, 1989), 715–17.

                concerning the death of John Hounte, servant of John Pæker atte Mersshe by the oath

                Spede, Thomas Abraam, Peter Peuesy, Henry Perpond, Thomas Wilton, and John Puryman

                say upon their oath that in the town of Andover there is a custom used in the summer
                from the feast of (the Invention of) the Holy Cross until the feast of St Peter ad
                Vincula of a play called the king's play and the aforesaid John Hounte in the said

                    ><del>Satisfaction: 4d</del></note> Andover toward the same cross and
                encountered Gilbert Webbe of Andover, who had in his hand a knife called a
                  'baselard'<note type="marginal" place="margin_left">Misfortune</note> and by
                misfortune the aforesaid John Hounte slipped and fell upon the point of the said
                knife and he wounded himself on the right side of his neck and soon died; and
                nothing else can be ascertained. The first finder (is) Adam Foghel<damage><gap
                    unit="chars" extent="2"/></damage> by the pledges of John Stene and John atte
                Welle. The next neighbours (are) Ralph Tournepayn by the pledges of John Pikare and
                Robert Picarde; Thomas atte More by the pledges of William Aleyn and Adam Aleyn;
                Richard Sprot by the pledges of William Picard and Thomas Phippe; Richard atte
                Strete by the pledges of John Wylemyn and Robert Haylyn. Forfeiture of chattels: one
                knife valued at 4d. And he responds in the town of Andover.</ab>

              <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/103192/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Enham</rs>, a bit further north, was once known as King's Enham but now as Enham Alamein,
              Alamein having been added at the end of World War II. Since all the places are called

              'baselard' ('Basyllard') is a 'type of long dagger or short sword with a hilt shaped
              like a capital H on its side <gap reason="omitted"/> usually worn at the girdle by
              civilians' (<title>OED</title>). Woolgar suggests that 'Pl<ex>egius</ex>
                inventor<ex>is</ex>' may be an error for 'primus inventor,' 'the first finder,'
              which would be the expected phrase, especially as the pledges follow after (C.M.

              sheriff of the county in 1513–14 and frequently acted as a Hampshire justice of the

              player(s)</rs> represented only one part of a larger reward to Lisle himself, but the town
              accounts include no other rewards or gifts to Lisle. The phrase more likely indicates
              that the 8d was only a part of a larger reward given to Lisle's player(s), just as the

            <p>On sig Cii, Bale remarks that the priest’s behavior reminds him of ‘wylle Somer.’ Will Somer (d. 1559) was perhaps the most famous court fool of the period. He served Henry VIII and Edward VI and his fame lasted into the seventeenth century, as Robert Armin described Somer and his tricks in his study of ‘natural’ fools, <title>Foole upon Foole</title> (1600). Somer appears as a character in Thomas Nashe’s 1592 <title>Summer’s Last will and Testament</title> and Samuel Rowley’s 1605 <title>When You See Me, You Know Me</title>, and may well have inspired Shakespeare’s Touchstone, Feste, and Lear’s Fool (‘Somer [Sommers], William (d. 1559),’ J.R. Mulryne, <title>ODNB</title>, 30 May 2013. https://doi-org.ezproxy.uhd.edu/10.1093/ref:odnb/26029.)</p>
            <p>The play named on sig Ciii is Bale’s own, usually known as <title>Three Laws</title>, an intensely anti-Catholic morality play of 1538. As the description in this work indicates, the play accuses the pope and his followers of a wide range of vices, and exhorts Christians to turn instead to the guidance of the three sets of laws: of nature, of Moses, and of Christ. See <title>Three Laws</title> in Peter Happé (ed), <title>The Complete Plays of John Bale</title>, (Cambridge, 1985), vol 2, 65–124.</p>

            <p> The dating of the accounts on pp 15–16 is a bit confusing, as 22 Henry VIII did not
              begin until 22 April 1530, whereas Palm Sunday fell on 10 April in 1530, so that Palm
              Sunday 22 Henry VIII was actually in 1531. The date 1530 is obviously the error, for
              the payments which follow these receipts are dated Palm Sunday 22 Henry VIII to Palm
              Sunday 23 Henry VIII. Furthermore, the set of accounts which follow these on p 17 are
              identified as being for 22–23 Henry VIII and are in fact another set of accounts for
              the same year as those on pp 15–16. The <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/3576/" type="Collective_ClergyAndChurchwardens">churchwardens</rs> are the same, as are all the
              amounts which occur in both accounts, such as those for <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/41327/" type="CalendarDay_Liturgical">paschal</rs> money, for <!--<rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/90177/" type="Person_Commoner">-->Edmond<!--</rs>-->'s
              rent, and for the amount of the profits from the church <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40561/" type="Entertainment_Type">ale</rs>. In fact it appears that
              the account begun on p 15 may originally have begun as the regular account for the
              year, but instead became an account detailing the receipts and expenses of the church
              ale, while the final account for the year is that given on p 17, which lists only the
              profits of the ale without details, as do most of the other years' accounts in this
              book. </p>

              October 1615, another memorandum records that the vicar and churchwardens called a
              meeting of the entire congregation with the purpose of instituting a church rate
              assessed on land, at a halfpenny an acre for arable and pasture land (pp 140–1). With
              the exception of the single entry in 1625–6, the records never again mention gains at
              Whitsun. </p>

              and as the latter was a churchwarden in the previous year (his name then spelled

              (As in many parishes, the churchwardens of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/86944/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Crondall</rs> served two-year terms,
              staggered so that a new churchwarden always served with one who had had a year's
              experience.) Neither Sone nor Wolbrig/Wolveridge is named as a churchwarden in the
              following set of accounts, so the years for which accounts are missing must have come
              after this set of accounts, and not before it. </p>

              <ab>Indented inquiry taken at Houghton in the county of Hampshire on 29 December in
                the sixth year of the reign of the lady Elizabeth, by the grace of God, queen of
                England, France, and Ireland, defender of the faith, etc, before Gilbert Mather,
                coroner of the said lady queen in the aforesaid county, over the sight of the body
                of John Hypper, lying dead, formerly sometime husbandman of the aforesaid Houghton
                in the aforesaid county, by the oath of John Stert, Robert Snowe, Thomas Mylles,
                William Williams, Robert Austen, Richard Burkley, William Karcas, Richard Barfoote,
                Michael Symmons, Thomas Purdew, John Goddard, John Barfoote, John Evans, and John
                Colson, jurors, who say on their oath that on 26 December in the aforesaid year (of
                the reign) of the said lady queen around the hour of six after midday of the same
                day, it so happened that the aforesaid John Hypper, with various other parishioners
                of the aforesaid Houghton, was playing certain games called 'Christmas games' in the
                house of one Thomas Purdew of the aforesaid Houghton, husbandman, and that the
                aforesaid John Hypper, while playing and sporting, by misfortune and against his
                will, squeezed himself and injured his testicle against his will, so that, by that
                occurrence and by reason of an old sickness suffered previously in his body, with
                great pain he was immediately ill, and thus became weak and grew more ill, from the
                said 26 December of the aforesaid year to twenty-eighth day of the same month of
                December thereafter next following. And on the same 28 December of the aforesaid
                year at the aforesaid Houghton in the aforesaid county in his own house, the
                aforesaid (Hypper) died from that occurrence and illness around the third hour
                before midday of the same day. And so the jurors say on their oath that the
                aforesaid John Hypper came to his death in the aforesaid way and manner and not
                otherwise. In witness of this, I the aforesaid coroner as well as the aforesaid
                jurors have placed our seals in turn on this indented inquiry on the day and year
                first aforesaid.</ab>

            <p> The main record of this case in the consistory court instance act book (HRO:

              <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/120337/" type="Person_Commoner">Clarice Baker</rs> as being from <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/87098/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Newton Valence</rs>, while <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/120272/" type="Person_Commoner">John Smyth</rs> was from <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/126893/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Droxford</rs>. The
              date is given on p 124 as 'xij Martii 1579,' but the year numbers change at Lady Day
              in these documents, so the year is actually 1580. The 'Crowne of golde' is more likely
              a coin than a crown that might have been part of their costumes as <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/59852/" type="Drama_Character">summer lord and
              lady</rs>. In many of the matrimonial cases before the consistory court a gold crown or

            <p> This biography of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/122058/" type="Person_Gentry">Sir John Leigh</rs> is the longest of a number of similar biographies
              of prominent members of the local aristocracy on the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/2363/" type="Place_County">Isle of Wight</rs>. <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/122275/" type="Person_Commoner">John Dingley</rs> was
              deputy lieutenant of the island to <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/116753/" type="Person_Nobility">Sir George Carey</rs> (1547–1603), later 2nd Baron
              Hunsdon, but Dingley's son- in-law John Leigh lived with his father-in-law and was
              more active and so did most of the work, leading Carey to appoint Leigh his deputy
              when Dingley died. Leigh continued as deputy under the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/83892/" type="Collective_Title">earl of Southampton</rs> after
              Carey's death in 1603. Thus the Sir John Leigh that Oglander has in mind here was some
              thirty-five years Oglander's senior. Oglander reports that Leigh died on 19 January
              1629/30, when Oglander's reckoning would have put his age at about eighty, for 'Sir
              John wase taken with a ded palsy <gap reason="omitted"/> when he wase abowt 30 yeres
              of adge <gap reason="omitted"/> and he lived with that palsy <gap reason="omitted"/>
              50 yeres' (Oglander, <title>Oglander Memoirs</title>, pp 142–7). Thus <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/98105/" type="Person_Gentry">Oglander</rs>'s story
              about <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/122058/" type="Person_Gentry">John</rs> and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/122384/" type="Person_Commoner">Elizabeth</rs> serving as the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/59852/" type="Drama_Character">lord and lady </rs>of the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/35779/" type="Entertainment_SeasonalCustom">summer</rs> <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/41249/" type="Thing_Set">pole</rs> before they
              were married refers to an event that probably occurred some years before Oglander's
              own birth rather than an event he had himself witnessed. In calling the maypole or
              summer pole an '<rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/35779/" type="Entertainment_SeasonalCustom">honest recreation</rs>' he suggests the nostalgia of a royalist and
              traditionalist for the seasonal festivities of earlier generations, as he does in his
              account of the custom of the wood eves in <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/126758/" type="Place_Feature">Parkhurst Forest</rs> or in his account of the

              1628 when Buckingham was assassinated, but it would have been in poor taste to tell a

            <p> All the men mentioned here, except <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/97911/" type="Person_Commoner">Fowes</rs>, are in a list of gentlemen of the Isle of

                Memoirs</title>, pp 23–4. The lord treasurer in 1631 was <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/97972/" type="Person_Nobility">Richard Weston</rs> (bap. 1577,
              d. 1635), later 1st earl of Portland, but in that year Baron Weston of Neyland.
              Oglander mentions that lord treasurer Weston was 'in ye Island' in August 1631 and
              July 1632; presumably the two had met earlier (<title>Oglander Memoirs</title>, p 62).
              The 'Worseley' here is not likely <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/121865/" type="Person_Gentry">Sir Henry Worsley</rs> of Appuldurcombe (1613–66), since
              Oglander is scrupulous about titles, but instead one of Sir Henry's sons – <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/127544/" type="Person_Commoner">Robert</rs> or

              a baronet in 1628 (John Burke and John Bernard Burke, <title>A Genealogical and
                Heraldic History of the Extinct and Dormant Baronetcies</title>, 2nd ed (London,
              1844), 161, 581). <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/128461/" type="Person_Gentry">Sir John Leigh</rs> of Northcourt (or North Shorwell) (1598–1666) was the

            <p>The characters are grouped with brackets to the right. In the left column the first

              are not bracketed, nor is (after a space) ‘morte atropos’; the next bracket begins
              with ‘marte’ and includes five names, ending with ‘age.’ The next bracket joins
              ‘impatience,’ ‘dolor,’ and ‘maladie’; the last bracket the remaining two names. In the
              second column, the first seven names are bracketed. Then there is a space and eleven
              names that are not bracketed, followed by another space. After the space the first

            <p>The editors have not been able to identify this description as a known morality play or allegorical pageant,
              and Martin Wiggins, author of <title>British Drama</title>, has privately indicated to
              them that this play does not appear to correspond with any extant play or any known
              post-Reformation lost play (Wiggins suggests the play may be mid-sixteenth century and
              has assigned the play a provisional catalogue number of 276.5). Almost half of the allegorical figures named in the list on f [13] correspond to characters in the <hi rend="italic">Roman de la Rose</hi>, the French thirteenth-century allegorical poem by Guilliaume de Lorris and Jean de Meun. Some are spelled as in the <hi rend="italic">Roman</hi>, while others have been rendered in an attempt at Italian. The scenes described on f [12] do not, however, resemble the narrative of the poem, so it is difficult to ascertain the extent to which the <hi rend="italic">Roman de la Rose</hi> influenced the writer(s) of the description and list.</p>
            <p>The list of characters
              does not appear to be in <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/113645/" type="Person_Gentry">Sir Richard Paulet</rs>'s hand, though the description may be; it
              has signs of being written rapidly, perhaps during a performance, much as Paulet's
              Parliamentary Diary does. Paulet certainly showed an interest in plays, as he
              purchased a number of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/70656/" type="Thing_BookPlayMusic">play texts</rs>, as well as attending <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40453/" type="Drama_Type">plays</rs>. He may have been
              recording the argument of a play he had seen, or this document may be some kind of
              plan for a performance of a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/129826/" type="Drama_Type">morality play</rs> that he somehow acquired. The use of French
              in the list of characters is reminiscent of the French (or perhaps Frenchified) names
              of the signatories to the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/127860/" type="Entertainer_Type">Maskers</rs>' Letter of 1586, but the possibility that this
              document is a description of the performance of those maskers is highly
              conjectural (see <ptr target="#hamps-ridp223495616"/>). The two different hands of the character list
              and the description do not resemble the hand of the Maskers' Letter. </p>

            <p> The French salutation and apparently French names of the signatories might mean this
              group of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/127860/" type="Entertainer_Type">performers</rs> was genuinely French, but it seems at least as likely that the
              performers were English and the French names were part of their <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40416/" type="Drama_Type">masking performance</rs>.
              Unfortunately, none of these individuals can be identified, either as professional
              performers or as local <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1967/" type="Place_County">Hampshire</rs> men who might be friends or tenants of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/113645/" type="Person_Gentry">Paulet</rs>'s. None
              of the names appear in Kathman's <title>Biographical Index</title>
              (http://shakespeareauthorship.com/bd/), or in the personal names index at the
              Hampshire Record Office. The one hint the letter gives as to what the performers
              intended to do for Paulet comes when they announce that they wish 'to trye
              o<ex>u</ex>r treasure that is leafte, and prove howe beste we maye/ increase the same,
              or else w<ex>i</ex>th losse goe emptye quyte awaye.' The 'treasure' may refer to some
              tangible objects, whose value could be increased or lost in some form of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40677/" type="Entertainment_Type">gambling</rs> or
              gift-exchange with Paulet. If so, they had in mind a very old form of masking like the

              side of the the hall, while the king and his entourage danced on the other (Chambers,

              the accounts thirteen entries above, and labelled July 1600, which probably indicates
              the ending date of the entries above the line, many of which are specifically dated as
              May or June 1600. Entries between that line and the lord of misrule entry carry dates
              ranging from 23 July through August, September, October, and November, to 29 December
              for the entry four above the one for the lord of misrule. On the other hand, the entry
              three after the one transcribed is for 14 October. Still, it seems likely that the
              lord of misrule would have been rewarded at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/41461/" type="CalendarDay_Liturgical">Christmastide</rs>. Also no place is indicated,
              though Paulet's main residence at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/106707/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Freefolk</rs> seems most likely (or possibly his other
              house at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/87010/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Herriard</rs>). </p>

            <p> When Paulet mentions 'the birth of the prince' on p 3, he is referring to the
              birthday of Prince Henry, who was born 19 February 1594 and thus sixteen on his
              birthday in 1609/10. His investiture as prince of Wales followed on 4 June of that
              year.</p>

            <p> The <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40416/" type="Drama_Type">masque</rs> on 5 June (p 28) was <title>Tethys' Festival</title>, for which see John

              346–58. Nichols also describes the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40677/" type="Entertainment_Type">tilt</rs> (p 361): 'Uppon Wednesday in the afternoone,
              in the Tilt-yeard, there were divers Earles, Barons, and others, being in rich and
              glorious armoure, and having costly caparisons, wondrous curiously imbroydered with
              pearls, gould, and silver, the like rich habiliaments for horses were never seene
              before. They presented their severall ingenious devices and trophies before the King
              and Prince, and then ran at Tilt, where there was a world of people to behould them.'

            <p> In the entry concerning payments on 7 January at ffarleye (<rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/123775/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Farleigh Wallop</rs>), the
              final item reads '&amp; S. to the horsman 2d. – iiij s. ij d.' (f [11v]). The capital
              'S' may simply be the abbreviation for shillings, mistakenly written here and not
              deleted. It may, however, be an abbreviation for 'Samborne,' that is, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/115469/" type="Person_Commoner">James Samborne</rs>,
              who is frequently paid elsewhere in these accounts for acting on <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/113645/" type="Person_Gentry">Paulet</rs>'s behalf. At
              the top of f [3] Paulet uses 'S' for 'Son' in 'my S Iervois' – his adopted son, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/115534/" type="Person_Gentry">Thomas
              Jervois</rs> – but Samborne seems more likely to have been making this payment to the
              horseman.</p>

            <p> The entry for the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1243/" type="Entertainer_Type">musicians</rs> on f [14v] seems to be squeezed into the bottom of the
              bracket that surrounds the other entries, with a horizontal line running through the
              middle of the entry that goes to the 'xij d.' at the right margin, but also connects
              to the bottom of the bracket. It seems more likely to be a late addition than a cross-
              out. The amounts for gifts add up to the 7s 2d in the right margin without the 12d to
              the musicians, so the payment to musicians should be treated as a separate entry
              rather than part of the bracketed gifts. Richard Samborne may be a son or brother of
              James Samborne, who was Thomas Jervoise's tutor and steward to Richard Paulet. 'poules Sermon' refers to a sermon given at St Paul’s Cathedral in London, likely at Paul’s Cross in the cathedral churchyard, which was a regular site for sermons. In his ‘Parliamentary Diary’ Paulet often mentions going to hear sermons at Paul’s Cross.</p>

            <p> The draft accounts for this year have survived and the
              entry corresponding to the one concerning the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/108222/" type="Person_Clergy">cardinal</rs> on f 2 is complete in the draft
              accounts: 'Solui minstrell' Cardinalis p<ex>er</ex> p<ex>re</ex>ceptu<ex>m</ex>
              Ioh<ex>ann</ex>is Em<ex>er</ex>y iij s. iiij d.' (f [5v], <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/135755/" type="Person_Commoner">John Emery</rs> was <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1140/" type="Collective_Office">mayor</rs> this
              year.)</p>

            <p> On f 2v, the Cutthorn was the boundary marker of the north-east corner of the city's
              liberties and was located at the northern end of the modern Southampton Common. The
              Court Leet traditionally met at that spot (Thick, <title>Southampton Steward's
                Book</title>, p 91, n 73).</p>

            <p> Entries in the draft accounts (SC5/1/3, f 6) suggest that the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/8709/" type="Entertainer_Type">minstrels</rs> who were
              given 20d on the 13 January 1433/4 (f 2v) were then given wages for part of the year
              as <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/13000/" type="Collective_Office">minstrels of Southampton</rs>, and they continued as the port town's musicians for some
              years thereafter.</p>

            <p> The entry concerning the minstrel's wages on f 4v does not occur in the list of
              similar wages paid to all the civic officials, though the next entry is for 20d to
              Nicholas Clerk of St Michael's for ringing the curfew bell. The latter, however, is a
              payment for the full year. Seven entries separate the two groups of entries here. The
              payment of wages on f 7v does occur with other wages paid for that quarter, perhaps
              suggesting that the payment for the quarter ending at midsummer was unusual in some
              way.</p>

            <p> The payments to minstrels on f 8 occur in a large group of expenses of the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1140/" type="Collective_Office">mayor</rs> for
              travel to <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/107462/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Waltham</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/79157/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Winchester</rs>, and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/36947/" type="Place_BoroughParish">London</rs>. However, the rewards to minstrels occur
              immediately after expenses for the craneman's livery, so these payments were probably
              given at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/72712/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Southampton</rs> by the mayor at various times of the year. </p>

            <p> The entry on f 6 of these draft accounts reveals what SC5/1/2 (<ptr target="#hamps-ridp224739600"/>)
             does not, that the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/8709/" type="Entertainer_Type">minstrels</rs> given partial wages on 16
              January and thereafter paid as <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/13000/" type="Collective_Office">Southampton's</rs> minstrels were given a reward on 13
              January as <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/79157/" type="Place_BoroughParish">minstrels 'de Wynchester.'</rs> Whether 'de' means 'of' or 'from,' it seems that
              these entries record the hiring of at least these two men, who were not residents of
              <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/72712/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Southampton</rs>, to become the civic minstrels. Perhaps the performance on 13 January was a kind of audition. The entries on this page are not written
              all the way to the bottom of the page as they are elsewhere in this manuscript.
              Instead only five entries follow the heading: 'It<ex>e</ex>m <del>conss</del>
              concessum est die <del>die</del> d<ex>om</ex>inica vz. xvij<hi rend="superscript"

              appears then that the recording of these payments indicates the adoption by the mayor
              and burgesses of this new set of minstrels. </p>

            <p> The steward for this year sets 'It' well to the left of the rest of each entry on f
              10, and there is no clear mark of abbreviation; abbreviation has been assumed and the
              abbreviation appropriately expanded. The 'u' in 'waytus' and 'Gownus' is peculiar, but
              obvious in the former, though it could be an 'i' in 'Gownus.' No punctuation follows
              'Gownus,' so it seems likely that this <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/136918/" type="Person_Commoner">John Lane</rs> is a member of the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/13000/" type="Collective_Office">waits</rs>. On f 10v

              Jay</rs> the entry specifically identifies him as a wait.</p>

              received gifts, some annually, some quarterly. In this year, for instance, gifts of

              added after the rest of the section, then cancelled for the reason given in the
              marginal note – that is, that payment was requested on the last day of the accounting
              year and the actual payment not given until the beginning of the following year. We
              would presumably have found the payment entered in the 1501–2 steward's accounts if
              they had survived.

              John Payne, so why Montagew should have been the one to pay the minstrels, four years
              before he became a burgess, is not clear (Butler, <title>Book of Fines</title>, vol 1,
              pp 54, 173). </p>

            <p> Butler transcribes 'mynstr<ex>elles</ex>' as 'mynistr' (<title>Book of
              Fines</title>, vol 1, p 55; Butler expands abbreviations silently). There may be an
              abbreviation mark after the 'n,' as well as the very clear abbreviation mark after the
              'r.' The word comes at the end of the line and appears to be squeezed in before the
              bracket that links both lines of the entry; in fact, it appears that the clerk first
              wrote 'min' with an abbreviation mark after the 'n' and then realized he had room to
              add 'str' with an abbreviation mark to make the meaning clearer. Thus, '<rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/8709/" type="Entertainer_Type">minstrels</rs>'
              seems the more likely reading, especially since the previous year a payment was given

              spent a good deal of time in Southampton between 1512 and 1514, involved in

              he lumped his accounts for the two years together. All three pages of accounts for
              this year are crossed through. The first folio (66) has an unfinished sum at the
              bottom, while the second folio of receipts and the folio of payments are never summed.
              The accounts are followed by a blank folio (67v), which is unusual in these accounts,
              suggesting that they are incomplete and perhaps draft accounts.</p>

            <p> For 'fett' in the second and third entries (that is, 'fetch' and 'fetched'
              respectively), Burch reads 'sett' (p 30), but the ligature from 's' to 'e' in this
              hand usually comes from the top right hand end (the right end of the curving top of
              the stroke), whereas this ligature comes from the middle of the vertical stroke, as if
              the crossing of the 'f'; 'f' and 's' are otherwise indistinguishable in this hand.

              gentry in <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1967/" type="Place_County">Hampshire</rs>; his estate was at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/123775/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Farleigh Wallop</rs> near <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/123118/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Basingstoke</rs>.</p>

            <p> Although 'Item' is written out in full, an otise abbreviation mark of a horizontal
              line consistently appears over it in the hand of this year's accounts. The heading
              gives the regnal years of these accounts as 12–13 Elizabeth, but the following year's
              accounts are also so headed, and internal dates in the next set of accounts suggest
              that this one is in fact for 11–12 Elizabeth, 1569–70.</p>

            <p> Butler (<title>Book of Fines</title>, vol 2, p 84) transcribes the second entry on
              this folio thus: 'Item the xth of maye payed unto mr Shuxborowe fare Lace vjd. for
              nayles iijd. to sette uppe the Revills of the Kinge in the <term ref="gloss:audicthowse-1">Audict howsse</term> ixd.' Such a
              record would certainly merit inclusion in this edition. However, the word Butler has
              transcribed as 'Revills' seems clearly to instead be 'Roulls,' which would also make
              more sense in the context of the Audit House. </p>

              Anglican Church, and worked to reconcile Anglican episcopal hierarchy with Calvinism.
              He played a role in Anglo-Dutch relations throughout his life (Willem Nijenhuis,

            <p> The accounts for this year are both very extensive and very detailed. Although
              individual entries are clearly dated to 1576–7, the heading gives regnal years of
              19–20 Elizabeth, which would translate to 1577–8. (The dating by regnal years again gets a year out of step with the heading of the 1573–4 accounts as 16–17 Elizabeth (f 147), following the accounts for 14–15 Elizabeth – there is no set of accounts headed 15–16 Elizabeth. The error becomes clear with the accounts for 1576–7, which are headed 19–20 Elizabeth (which would be 1577–8) but are twice dated internally to 1577 before Michaelmas.)

            <p> As the entry concerning Essex's players (f 197v) indicates, the regnal years given
              in the headings of the accounts are still one year out, as 28–9 Elizabeth would be
              1586–7. The '23<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of March 85' is of course 23 March 1586
              by modern reckoning, as the new year number was not used until <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/72087/" type="CalendarDay_Liturgical">Lady Day</rs> (25 March).
              The entry for the queen's bearward (f 197) appears two entries above one for 4
              December and four above one for 3 January, so it probably belongs to the autumn of
              1585. </p>

              W.R. Streitberger, <title>Masters of the Revels and Elizabeth I's Court
                Theatre</title> (Oxford, 2016). Lord Beauchamp was <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/130875/" type="Person_Nobility">Edward Seymour </rs>(1561–1612), son
              of the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/144234/" type="Person_Nobility">Edward Seymour</rs> who was <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/30047/" type="Collective_Title">earl of Hertford</rs> and who had angered the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/11772/" type="Person_Royalty">queen</rs> by
              marrying <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/144352/" type="Person_Nobility">Katherine Grey</rs>, younger sister of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/144455/" type="Person_Royalty">Lady Jane Grey</rs>, without Elizabeth's consent in
              1560. Hertford was imprisoned until his wife's death in 1568 and spent a long time
              regaining his standing with the queen. In September of 1591 Hertford hosted Elizabeth
              on <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40648/" type="Entertainment_Type">progress</rs> at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/155529/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Elvetham</rs>, in north-eastern <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1967/" type="Place_County">Hampshire</rs>, providing elaborate <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/62012/" type="Entertainment_Type">shows</rs> for her
              entertainment. Beauchamp's right to the title was in dispute for most of his life,
              since his parents' marriage had been declared void and Beauchamp himself illegitimate

            <p> There is no way of knowing why the civic authorities in <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/72712/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Southampton</rs> decided to start
              copying the players' licences in 1591. One possibility is that the town wanted to be
              able to refuse permission to play to some visiting companies, and the language of both
              this licence and the following one makes clear the town's right to deny permission to
              any companies that could not produce such a licence.<rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/175683/" type="Collective_Troupe"> Beauchamp's men</rs> had only recently
              gotten into trouble in <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/73838/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Norwich</rs>, where in June 1590 they were refused permission to
              play and given 20s to leave town without performing, but according to the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1140/" type="Collective_Office">mayor</rs>'s

              'Mufford,'</rs> as the Norwich record calls him, was jailed for a time for his temerity,
              which likely means he was the leader of the group. <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/180413/" type="Person_Commoner">Thomas Blackwood</rs> is the only other
              actor in the group who is mentioned elsewhere, as a member of Worcester's men in 1602

                Stage</title>, vol 2 (Oxford, 1923), 226, 303). Beauchamp's players were never a
              particularly successful company, but 1590–1 was one of their busiest years, as they
              were recorded at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/123162/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Faversham</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/123184/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Lydd</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/123206/" type="Place_BoroughParish">New Romney</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/73838/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Norwich</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/37840/" type="Place_BoroughParish">York</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/123228/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Shrewsbury</rs>, and

            <p> The licence copied on f 23v concerns the Dutton brothers, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/180666/" type="Person_Commoner">John</rs> and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/180596/" type="Person_Commoner">Laurence</rs>, who
              began their acting careers in the early 1570s, joining the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/12706/" type="Collective_Troupe">earl of Warwick's company</rs>
              in the late 1570s and then shifting to the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/50533/" type="Collective_Troupe">earl of Oxford's men</rs> in 1580 (Kathman,
                <title>Biographical Index</title>, ). John became a member of the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/17169/" type="Collective_Troupe">queen's men</rs> when
              the master of the revels assembled that 'all–star' company in 1583. By 1591 the
              queen's men were no longer the pre-eminent company in the land or even at court;
              <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/181689/" type="Person_Commoner">Tarlton</rs> had died and some of their earlier members had left. Records from around the
              country suggest that two different companies were travelling in the queen's name in
              1591, one led by John Lanham, the other by the Duttons (Scott McMillin and Sally-Beth
              MacLean, <title> The Queen's Men and their Plays</title> (Cambridge and New York,
              1998; rpt 2006), 11–12, 52–3, 62). One can easily imagine the mayor at Southampton
              asking the Duttons to produce their licence and having it copied into the town
              records, when only a short time before (on <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/41869/" type="CalendarDay_Liturgical">Shrove Sunday</rs>, 14 February) the town had
              paid a different group calling themselves the queen's
              players (see <ptr target="#hamps-ridp227867600"/>, ff 225, 226v). The
              earlier visitors were likely Lanham's group, as the Duttons were paid for performing
              at court in January, February, and March of 1590/1 (W.R. Streitberger, <title> The
                Masters of the Revels and Elizabeth I's Court Theatre</title> (Oxford, 2016), 278).

            <p> While the warrant was originally written on 7 March 1605/6, the copying of the
              warrant cannot be dated very exactly: it is preceded by copies of petitions to both
              <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/11772/" type="Person_Royalty">Elizabeth</rs> and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/17496/" type="Person_Royalty">James</rs> about how <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/72712/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Southampton</rs> was suffering from encroachment on its
              monopoly of the sweet <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40997/" type="Thing_FoodDrink">wine</rs> trade. None of these, including the last and longest to
              James, is dated. The item following this warrant, on f 203, is dated 12 November 1606.
              The dated item closest but before the warrant (f 192v) is dated November 1606 and the
              one before that (f 191v) 26 October 1606, so it seems likely that the queen's men
              visited Southampton in the fall, possibly early November, and their warrant was copied
              at that time.</p>

              troupe (see the record of 11 December 1607, in which Greene and Tompson are given two
              silver <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/42646/" type="Thing_LiveryRegalia">scutcheons</rs>).</p>

            <p> Connor writes of the 'scutchins' on f 39: 'The three roses are of course part of the
              blazon of the town arms; the H and tun are a reference to Hamtun, a form of the name
              by which the town was still known at this time' (<title>Southampton Mayor's
                Book</title>, p 110, n 392). The scutcheons still exist among the corporation plate
              and a photograph of one appears on the cover of Burch, <title>Minstrels and
                Players</title>.</p>

            <p> The entire entry concerning <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/146198/" type="Person_Commoner">John Sopp</rs> on f 39v has been struck though. According to
              Connor, the plague referred to must have occurred in 1604 (<title>Southampton Mayor's
                Book</title>, p 111, n 404).</p>

            <p> The first entry on f 41 appears to be in error. It seems likely that Greene was
              never intended to take <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/147094/" type="Person_Commoner">Fryce</rs> as an <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/55239/" type="Collective_Occupation">apprentice</rs> but that the scribe mistook the Fryce
              case for Sopp's, which follows immediately after, and cancelled the erroneous
              reference to Greene. Of course it is possible that the council did intend to
              apprentice Fryce to Greene as well and then changed their minds, so that the reference
              to Greene was cancelled and the note about finding Fryce a master was added before
              turning to Sopp's case. The marginal note that assigns the boy to <!--<rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/147155/" type="Person_Commoner">-->Heravill<!--</rs>--> was almost
              certainly added at a later date. </p>

            <p>Connor writes of the 'scutchins' on f 56: 'The three roses are of course part of the
              blazon of the town arms; the H and tun are a reference to Hamtun, a form of the name
              by which the town was still known at this time' (<title>Southampton Mayor's
                Book</title>, p 110, n 392). The scutcheons still exist among the corporation plate
              and a photograph of one appears on the cover of Burch, <title>Minstrels and
                Players</title>.</p>
            <p>The hand here uses the standard 's' when the mark for 'es' seems called for, as in
              'Burgesss' and 'Ross,' where the final 's' is the standard final short 's' and the
              preceding 's' is the long 's.' The 'es' abbreviation mark is used when not strictly
              necessary, as in 'Bayliff<ex>es</ex>.' </p>

            <p> A 'hughster' or huckster was someone licensed by the council to buy goods, primarily
              food and wood, at the market before the market was officially open. The hucksters
              would then re-sell those goods at a higher price. Court leet juries frequently tried
              to limit the activities of the hucksters, since they sometimes bought up the entire
              supplies of certain goods in order to force people to buy at their inflated prices.
              However, as this record shows, the council continued to permit some people to support
              themselves by huckstering. In the case of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/146133/" type="Person_Commoner">Greene</rs>, it appears that what he made as a
              <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1243/" type="Entertainer_Type">musician</rs> was insufficient, so the council allowed him to seek additional income as a
              huckster (Hearnshaw and Hearnshaw, <title>Court Leet Records</title>, 379–80;

              exclusively in the provincial records, sometimes in doubtful circumstances that

              <ab><gap reason="omitted"/>Likewise, because, by incautious and unregulated games
                carried out in the chapel, cloister, or hall of our said college, near Winchester,
                from the insolence perhaps of some in the same, the said chapel and hall could
                frequently be damaged or even deformed in the walls, stables, pictures, and glass
                windows, and elsewhere, we, desiring to make provision for the security of these
                things, strictly prohibit the throwing of stones and balls and anything else in the
                aforesaid chapel, cloister, stables, and hall, and, in addition, dances, wrestling
                matches, and any other incautious and unregulated games done at any time ever, by
                which, or by any one of which, damage or loss in material or form could be inflicted
                in any way to the sumptuous buildings, in the aforesaid chapel, cloister, and hall.
                Likewise, because the grammar schools, in which the scholars of our said college
                will be obliged to learn and study, are situated below the aforesaid hall, which in
                the manner of a solarium stands raised up and built above the ground, they (<hi
                  rend="italic">ie,</hi> the scholars), by wrestling matches, dances, revelry,
                leaping, singing, clamours, tumult and excessive noise, spillings of water, beer,
                and other liquids, and tulmultuous games, perhaps occurring in that very hall, could
                easily and plausibly be hindered in their study and learning and otherwise sustain
                serious damage to books (and) clothes. We, therefore, strictly prohibit that any
                wrestling matches, dances, revelry, leaping, singing, clamours, tumult and excessive
                noise, spillings of water, beer, and other liquids, and tumultuous games of this
                sort and any other irregularities of any kind take place in the aforesaid hall at
                any time ever, by which, or by any one of which, the aforesaid scholars could be
                hindered in any way from their study or learning or otherwise sustain damage or
                grievance to their books, clothing, or other things, or by which the hall itself, in
                its ornamentation or fabric, below or above, inside or outside, in any part of it,
                could be disfigured or suffer injury or damage. And if anyone should be found guilty
                in the premises or in any one of the premises, he shall make thorough satisfaction
                for the damage inflicted by him. And nevertheless, in order that the punishment of
                one may be the fear of many, let him be punished harshly by the withholding of his
                commons, or otherwise, according to the discretion and arrangement of the warden and
                vice-warden, the bursars, and the sacrist of the said college, according to the
                magnitude of the offence without any partiality whatsoever. <gap reason="omitted"/>

              <ab>John Yerd complains against Richard Syngere on a plea of trespass. And whereupon
                he also complains that, although it was thus agreed between the aforesaid Richard
                and John on 4 July in the tenth year of the reign of the now lord, King Henry, at
                Winchester that the said John would play the steward in a play called 'play of St
                Agnes' with the said Richard on the sixteenth day then next following and (that) the
                same Richard would find for the same John the clothing and all other gear suitable
                for such a steward together with his costs and expenses in the meantime, yet this
                Richard did not find for the said John either his clothing or victuals or costs and
                expenses as was agreed among them. Wherefore he (<hi rend="italic">ie,</hi> John)
                claims that he is injured and incurs a loss to the value of 40s and thereupon he
                brings (suit). And the aforesaid Richard, present in court, denies the force (<hi
                  rend="italic">ie,</hi> of the accusation) and the injury; wherefore, etc. And he
                claims that there was never such a bargain between them just as, etc, and on this
                matter he demands to be tried by the country (<hi rend="italic">ie,</hi> he demands
                a jury trial) and the aforesaid John (does) likewise. Therefore provision was made
                for an officer of the court to cause a jury, etc, to come, by whom, etc, for the
                next Wednesday, etc. The same day, etc.</ab>

              <ab>William Selver, knight in the aforesaid play, complains against the aforesaid

              <ab>Richard Syngere complains against John Fromond, weaver, Richard Trobwyk, William
                Selver, and John Yerd on a plea of trespass. And whereupon he complains that the
                aforesaid John, Richard Trowbyk, William, and John came with force and arms,
                assaults, staves, and knives at Winchester on the Sunday next after the feast of the
                Translation of St Thomas the Martyr in the tenth year of our now lord King Henry, 
                and there they broke into and entered the home of that very Richard against his will
                and made an attack upon him (and) so beat, wounded, and maltreated him that
                his life was despaired of. And they inflicted other crimes on him, namely, they took
                one original of St Agnes and one cloth called 'playing cloth' total price 10s, from
                the goods and chattels of that very Richard Syngere and carried them away unjustly
                and contrary to the peace of our lord king, &amp;c, and to a loss to that very
                Richard Syngere of 100s and thereupon he brings suit, &amp;c. And the aforesaid John
                Fromond, weaver, Richard Trowbyk, William Selver, and John Yerd, present in court,
                deny the force (<hi rend="italic"> ie,</hi> of the accusation) and the injury,
                wherefore, etc, and the damages, etc. And they claim that they are not guilty
                thereof and on this matter they demand (that they be tried) by the country
                (requested to be tried by jury), etc, and the aforesaid Richard Syngere likewise,
                etc. Therefore provision was made for an officer of the court to cause a jury, etc,
                to come before the eighth day, etc, by whom, etc. The same day, etc.</ab>

            <p> Dating these records to 1409 is dependent on matching the names of civic officials

              could mean either 16 July or the sixteenth day after 4 July (20 July). The earlier

              became lord chancellor in 1532/3. However, Thomas Audley was not knighted until 1532
              and did not become Baron Audley of Walden until 1538. In 1526–7 the only Lord Audley
              was <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/148043/" type="Person_Nobility">John Tuchet</rs> (1483–1557/8), 8th Baron Audley, who had lands in <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/2255/" type="Place_County">Somerset</rs> and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/2291/" type="Place_County">Surrey</rs>.
              John Tuchet was son to <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/188519/" type="Person_Nobility">James Tuchet</rs> (<hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1463–97), 7th Baron

              that he suffered from debt the rest of his life. Employing <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/8709/" type="Entertainer_Type">minstrels</rs> would have been
              an extravagance for one in his financial position but he may have thought that

              Winchester College,' pp 110–11. As pointed out there, the ship was almost certainly
              used as a prop in a performance of Plautus' <title>Rudens</title> and was evidently
              used on more than one occasion, hence the need for repairs to it. </p>

              (1505–50), 1st earl of Southampton, was <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/37031/" type="Collective_Office">lord
              chamberlain</rs> at this time (mb [2]) but he was ill, and from 24 April 1574 <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/25845/" type="Person_Nobility">Charles
              Howard</rs>, 2nd Baron Howard of Effingham (1536–1624), was acting lord chamberlain.

            <p> There is evidence here of two separate <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40648/" type="Entertainment_Type">visits</rs> by <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/11772/" type="Person_Royalty">the queen</rs> during this accounting
              year (mb [5d]). The queen was in <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/79157/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Winchester</rs> for three nights from 10–13 September
              1574, according to <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/121275/" type="Person_Gentry">Walsingham</rs>'s journal ('Journal of Sir Francis Walsingham from
              December 1570 to April 1583,' <title>The Camden Miscellany</title>, Charles Trice
              Martin (ed), vol 6 (np, 1871), 21). Her council sat at Winchester on Sunday the 12th.
              There is no record as to where she stayed. If she visited a second time, the dates are
              unknown. Falconer's Corner was between St Swithun Street and Symonds Street (then
              called Minster Street) against the Close Wall. The queen must therefore have been
              visiting the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/107876/" type="Place_Feature">cathedral</rs>, not one of the city churches.</p>

            <p> Tertiary entries include mending of the highways, the buttes (twice), and East Gate,
              and painting of the High Cross. </p>

            <p> There were two churches dedicated to St Peter in <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/79157/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Winchester</rs> at this time (once there
              had been five): <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/107590/" type="Place_BoroughParish">St Peter's Colebrook</rs> and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/111652/">St Peter's Chesil</rs> (Keene and Rumble,
                <title>Medieval Winchester</title>, vol 1, pt 1, p 135). It seems likely that the
              church involved was St Peter's Colebrook. The two parishes were contiguous, on the
              eastern side of the city, separated only by the River Itchen and the town wall, for St
              Peter's Chesil lay in the suburbs outside the East Gate in the area known as <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/111630/" type="Place_BoroughParish">the Soke</rs>,
              a separate jurisdiction from the city since 1231. The <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/154663/" type="Collective_Office">bishop of Winchester</rs> was the
              principal landlord in the Soke and the bishop appointed a steward or bailiff to
              administer this area, an official at times called the 'mayor of the Soke' in the
              records. The <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1140/" type="Collective_Office">mayor</rs> of the city of Winchester had no authority in the Soke, and thus
              would not have been concerned with <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/8782/" type="Entertainer_Type">players</rs> performing at St Peter's Chesil (Keene and
              Rumble, <title>Medieval Winchester</title>, vol 1, p 72). St Peter's Colebrook was
              originally in the precinct of St Mary's Abbey and the abbey may have been responsible
              for the survival of this rather poor parish, as the abbey was patron of church and
              provided annual support for the rector, support replaced in 1542 by an annual pension
              from the Crown. By 1652 the parish had declined so badly that the corporation ordered
              it united with that of St Maurice (Keene and Rumble, <title>Medieval
                Winchester</title>, vol 2, pts 2–3, pp 847–8). </p>

              <ab>Francis Hamlin has been attached to answer to Henry Fissher concerning a plea of
                offence on the case, and in respect whereof the same Henry Fissher through John
                Morne his attorney complains that, whereas the same Francis Hamlin, by his craft
                which he employs, was employed in the making and adjusting of stringed instruments,
                in English, fiddles or viols, and whereas the same <del>Francis</del> Henry was and
                is a pedotribe, in English, one who teaches children how to dance or exercise their
                bodies, and whereas on the twentieth day of August in the fifth year of the reign of
                our lord, King Charles, now of England, etc, here at the city of Winchester within
                the jurisdiction of this court, in consideration of 20d of legal English money paid
                by the same Henry to the same Francis in advance, and 7s to be paid by the same
                Henry to the same Francis after the making of two stringed instruments, in English,
                of two fiddles or viols, to be made for the same Henry by the same Francis, he
                undertook, and to the same Henry then and in the same place promised faithfully,
                that he himself, the same Francis, would make and adjust the two stringed
                instruments, in English, two fiddles or viols, for the same Henry within the fifteen
                days, in English, within the fortnight then next following. However, the aforesaid
                Francis, caring little for his aforesaid promise and undertaking, but contriving and
                intending deceitfully to cheat and defraud cunningly and wickedly the same Henry
                Fissher in this matter, did not make and adjust the two stringed instruments
                according to his aforesaid promise and undertaking. By which cause the same Henry
                Fissher has been deprived of and lost no small amount of profit and benefit in the
                profession of pedotribe, in which he was then employed and is still employed.
                Wherefore the same Henry says that he is damaged and has loss to the value of forty
                shillings, and in respect thereof he presents his suit, etc.</ab>

              <ab>On the holy day of Easter the seven canonical hours should be celebrated by monks
                in the Church of God after the custom of the canons, on account of the authority of
                St Gregory, pope of the apostolic see, as he himself set forth in his antiphonary.
                At a suitable time on the same night before the bells of matins are rung, the
                sacristans shall take up the cross and place it in its proper place. First, at
                nocturns, when the praise of God is begun by the abbot or any priest, he shall say
                once only 'O Lord, open my lips' in the church; then 'God, come to my aid' with the
                Gloria. Moreover, since the psalm 'Lord, how they are multiplied (who persecute me)'
                is omitted, the cantor shall begin the invitatory. Then (follow) three antiphons
                with three psalms, (and) when these are finished, the proper verse shall be said,
                (and) then as many lessons, with the responsories, properly belonging here. While
                the third lesson is being read, four brothers shall vest themselves, one of whom,
                wearing an alb and as if to do something else, shall enter and go unobtrusively to
                the location of the sepulchre and shall sit there quietly holding a palm in his
                hand. And while the third responsory is being said in full, the three remaining
                shall follow, all indeed vested in copes and carrying in their hands thuribles with
                incense, and step by step, in the likeness of those seeking something, shall come
                before the location of the sepulchre. For these things are done in imitation of the
                angel sitting in the tomb and of the women coming with spices to anoint the body of
                Jesus. When, therefore, the one sitting shall see the three come near him as if
                wandering and searching for something, he shall begin to sing sweetly in a moderate
                voice, 'Whom do you seek?' When this (antiphon) has been sung to the end, the three
                shall respond with one voice, 'Jesus of Nazareth.' He (shall reply) to them, 'He is
                not here. He has risen just as he had foretold. Go, announce that he has risen from
                the dead.' At the sound of this command, those three shall turn themselves to the
                choir, saying, 'Alleluia! The Lord is risen.' When this has been said, the one sitting, as if calling them
                back again, shall say the antiphon, 'Come and see the place.' Truly as he says this,
                he shall rise and lift the veil and show to them the place bare of the cross but
                only the linen cloths, in which the cross had been wrapped, placed (there). Seeing
                this, they shall lay down the thuribles which they had carried in the same
                sepulchre, and they shall take the linen and hold it out facing the clergy, and, as
                if showing that the Lord has risen and was no longer wrapped in it, they shall sing
                this antiphon: 'The Lord has risen from the sepulchre.' Then they shall lay the
                linen on the altar. When the antiphon is finished, the prior, rejoicing for triumph
                of our king because he rose after death had been overcome, shall begin the hymn 'We
                praise you, O God.' When this has begun, all the bells shall be struck in unison<gap

            <p> The edition of the <title>Regularis Concordia</title> that appears here, including
              the translation, was prepared by James M. Gibson (with assistance from Abigail Young
              and Patrick Gregory) for <title>Kent: Diocese of Canterbury</title>, vol 1, REED
              (Toronto and Buffalo, 2002), 23–7. Gibson describes the editorial approach in an
              endnote (<title>Kent</title>, vol 3, 263):</p>

            <p> 'The <title>Regularis Concordia</title> survives in two Latin manuscripts, one of
              which has an Anglo-Saxon gloss. Unlike most REED editions of texts surviving in
              multiple manuscripts, this edition does not adopt a base text to which the other text
              is collated, since neither of the Latin texts could be preferred for the excerpt
              included here. The Latin text printed here is therefore based upon a full collation
              and recension of the two manuscripts. Readings have been chosen for sense rather than
              according to the manuscript in which they are found; the text presented contains the
              best readings from both manuscripts. In keeping with REED practice, however, there is
              no textual emendation. Thus every word of the text can be found in one or both of the
              manuscripts, although the whole text cannot be found in either one of them. The
              critical apparatus reports all significant variants, using the orthography and
              capitalization of the MS in which they occur, but excludes minor variations in
              orthography, capitalization, and distinction between "et" and "&amp;." The text also
              departs from the standard REED practice of indicating with italics the expansion of
              abbreviations. The Anglo-Saxon text is given in full from BL: Cotton Tiberius
              A.III.'</p>

            <p> These entries occur between the itemized receipts for 1578–9 and the payments.
              Presumably the nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first years are regnal years of Queen
              Elizabeth, as this account was rendered in her twenty-first. The accounts for 1576–7
              and 1577–8 do not mention <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/35779/ http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40561/" type="Entertainment_SeasonalCustom">king ales</rs>, so it is difficult to ascertain the meaning of
              these entries. Perhaps the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/3576/" type="Collective_ClergyAndChurchwardens">churchwardens</rs> had retained bills against the king ale
              receipts until an ale was held in 1579, allowing the wardens to pay all the creditors.

            <p> The payment 'to the LL back againe'(p 49) may refer to the 'Ladyes' and 'Lordes'
              whose liveries are recorded further down that page, but it is uncertain whether that
              is the correct reading of the abbreviation or what it meant for 'LL' to be 'back
              againe.'</p>
            
            <p>
              It is not certain what the churchwardens meant by their payment 'to Whitburne for his play' (p 49). The other 'play' mentioned in the accounts is the 'play at Pewter' that appears to be some kind of gambling game, and perhaps Whitburne had organized or led the gambling. King ales did not normally have written play texts, so it is very unlikely the payment was for writing such a text. However, it could mean that Whitburne was being rewarded for playing in the sense of playing an instrument, as parishes often paid minstrels to contribute to the festivities. Or it might even mean that Whitburne had played the 'king' of the king ale, and was being rewarded for taking on that central role in the celebration.
            </p>
            
            <p>The name of 'Whitburne,' who was paid 'for his play,' does not occur
              elsewhere in the churchwardens' accounts, nor in the parish registers, nor in the
              indexes of wills from Hampshire at the Hampshire Record Office. Families named
              Whitchurch and Wither (or Wyther) do appear in the register (75M72/PR1) but since
              Richard Wither was one of the churchwardens in this year, it is unlikely the accounts
              would misspell Wither as 'Whitburne.' A Robert 'Whithorne' was buried in the parish on
              10 June 1621, but the person paid for his play in this year very clearly has a 'b'
              following the 't.'</p>

            <p> The notation 'p<ex>ai</ex>d' next to most of the rent items on p 50 was obviously
              added later – the 'Items' line up under 'ffirst' as the original left margin. The
                'p<ex>ai</ex>d' in the line about John Ale's sheep rent and the note
                'forge<ex>ue</ex>n' in the margin of the following entry are in a fainter ink and
              possibly a different hand than above. The John Primmer line was inserted between
              original lines.</p>

              margin, separates the entry for the musicians from the next (for bell ropes).
              Presumably this line separates the expenses on the king ale above it from the general

        <div>
          <p>These dictates are copies of dictated lessons contained in a small booklet written by a scholar called <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/219137/" type="Person_Commoner">William Badger</rs> between 1563 and 1567. They were mostly dictated by the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/17037/" type="Collective_Occupation">schoolmaster</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/218259/" type="Person_Commoner">Christopher Johnson</rs>, but occasionally by the usher, when Johnson was absent preparing senior boys for entry to New College, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/73905/" type="Place_Feature">Oxford</rs>. Eight of the 422 dictates in Badger’s notebook concern dramatic performance, some speaking of the drama generally, but others referring specifically to performances at Winchester College. By combining Johnson’s frequent mentions of holidays and other annual events with Badger’s recording when he enters a new form and the beginning of each week of the term, Baldwin was able to determine fairly accurately when each dictate was given (<title>Shakspere’s Small Latine</title>, vol 2, pp 706–16). For more on these records, see ‘<rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215119/" type="Drama_Type">School Drama</rs>’ in the introduction to <ref target="https://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/collections/hamps/traditions/">Performance Traditions</ref>,’and Cowling, ‘Performance at Winchester College,’ pp 101–15. Dr Abigail Ann Young of Records of Early English Drama and Dr Stephen P. Anderson, Head of Classics at Winchester College, provided translations and suggested notes for the transcriptions below.

<ab>When I was annoyed because of those who called a multitude together to
the shows and decided one ought to refrain from corporal punishment
since they had worked not at all reluctantly, I began to use abuse,
full of acrimony and vexation, as is my custom: rather rashly, perhaps,
especially among stricken spirits, but I gave full rein to my grief.
And so when I had driven them all off with my savage words, I forced
them wholly to assume those parts which they had in the comedy, not
just on the stage but in life itself and deed, as a way of placating my
spirit. Eubulus formed no less sound a plan about his affairs than he
gave the day before to Pelargus, his neighbour and friend. Acolastus
again goes into exile, who, I fear, may fall among the Pamphagi and
Pantalabes. Surely Pelargus, just as unhappy now as previously, finds
it hard, I think, to be separated from his son.</ab>

<ab>Your business was carried out in such a way under yesterday's light, as
much with regard to the unusual pronunciation as to the action itself
that now and hereafter, as sunny old men, you can remember your
performances. You may say 'I remember, when I was a boy, having
performed (plays) which were in Greek. He was an actor, and so was he;
and I myself played some part.' And this will be a glory which never
adorned your forefathers.</ab>

Fifteenth dictate, probably in the fifth week of the term. Baldwin

<ab>From those stage plays which we have lately exhibited publicly to the
view, I think you have derived this benefit besides others, that you
have learned yourselves and are also able to teach others – if there
were need – with what expression, with what gestures something should
be pronounced. For there should be in the voice a certain amount of
elevation, depression, and modulation, in the body decorous movement
without prancing around, sometimes more quiet, at others more vehement,
with stamping of the feet accommodated to the subject. These I remember
I taught, all of which you expressed dexterously enough. It remains
that you so remember that if anything hereafter be undertaken in a
similar matter neither I shall seem to have lost my labour nor you the
fruit of labour.</ab>

<ab>The interpreters of Terence and Plautus say a great deal about the
origin of comedies and of their nature, disputing not a little so that
it may be clear what comedy is. Some wish it to be an imitation of
civil life, others wish it to be a representation of the manners which
are found in old men, youths, courtesans, pimps, parasites, and others
of that kind. From these if it were permitted for me to dissent, I
think I could give both a truer and shorter definition of comedy. For
what else is comedy than a laborious nothing? Invention difficult,
disposition laborious, the description of parts difficult, the training
of those who act, if they are a little inept,  exasperating, the
providing of the curtains well-nigh impossible, the construction of the
theatre expensive, the exclusion from the doors not without the offence
of many, and the comedy itself nothing. For what is so completely
nothing as that which in one moment of the hour, point of time, winking
of the eye, both begins to be and ceases?</ab>

<ab>When the commander Iphicrates had seen the poultry cocks of Midas'
barber attacking those who were Callias' with wings and beak, he turned
his mind to military glory. They say that the same thing happened to
Themistocles, who when he was leading the army out against the
barbarians, saw cocks fighting and, stopping the whole army, he said to
them: 'Can it be that these (cocks) are fighting not for their homeland
nor for their household gods, nor for liberty, or for children, but
only lest one be overcome by the other or one give place to another?'
With these words he strengthened the spirits of the Athenians and put
the Persians to flight. Thereafter the Athenians made a law that
poultry cocks should fight every year in the theatre. Understand that
this same practice is only allowed you so that, as no half-hearted
onlookers of that fight, you may, each one, earnestly take from it an
incentive to courage, along with Iphicrates and the other Athenians.</ab>

<ab rend="center">On Monday</ab>
<ab>The three parts of comedies are reckoned as prothesis, epitasis, and
catastrophe. Comedies, moreover, are said to be imitators of people who
exist in real life, so let no one doubt that these same divisions occur
in real life. You should note also the three time periods in diseases:
growth, stasis, and decline. This same thing occurred in the recent
holidays, for they had a beginning, a middle, and an end, that you may
understand that what Cicero said is true, that nothing ought to seem
lasting that will have an end.</ab>

<ab>What shall I say! That it happens that every night!</ab>

<ab>Our plays continually pass before my eyes.</ab>

<ab>But Mitio does not disturb me with empty forms,</ab>

<ab>Nor Nero – Cambyses alone does all.</ab>

<ab>He and his satraps and his wife and everyone,</ab>

<ab>Whether priests or savage monsters, flow by me.</ab>

you, my wife, weep so often from your heart and renew your griefs? Do
you doubt my faithfulness, whose marriage-bed you now occupy as a
bride?</cell></row>
<row><cell>Poppaea:</cell><cell>Augustus, greatest glory of the world, I,
late (but a) handmaiden, acknowledge that it is your gift that I seem
worthy of your marriage-bed and am called your wife. I have never
sought this nor was it my so arrogant desire – I call sacred marriage
and you yourself, a divinity, especially to be worshipped by me, to
witness. Although what good is that gift, to be the wife of Nero and a
partner in such great power if yet I remain lowly as I was before when
I was married to Crispinus, spurned, despised by all, fearful of ruin,
because the servants of evil who gravely threaten my head no longer
speak secretly and insult me even now that you are my husband.</cell></row>
<row><cell>Nero:</cell><cell>Does anyone do this against the wife of Nero?</cell></row>
<row><cell>Poppaea:</cell><cell>I am not called a wife! That one calls me
courtesan and whore.</cell></row>
<row><cell>Nero:</cell><cell>You, joined to me by holy bonds, who bear a part of
me?</cell></row>

harshly.</cell></row>
<row><cell>Nero:</cell><cell>Do they deny that it is mine?</cell></row>

dared.</cell></row>

<row><cell>Nero:</cell><cell>Let another learn (how) to be leader from the death
of Plautus.</cell></row>
<row><cell>Poppaea:</cell><cell>It has many Plauti in one woman.</cell></row>
<row><cell>Nero:</cell><cell>What woman is so powerful that she would dare such a
thing?</cell></row>
<row><cell>Poppaea:</cell><cell>The one who bears such great titles, whose father
was Claudius.</cell></row>
<row><cell>Nero:</cell><cell>Who barren and despised has given place to
you?</cell></row>
<row><cell>Poppaea:</cell><cell>Who lives and still nurtures a powerful
spirit.</cell></row>
<row><cell>Nero:</cell><cell>Slight things (or exiles) are soon broken.</cell></row>
<row><cell>Poppaea:</cell><cell>If in fact, Nero, she were wholly sent into
exile! But now she has retinues in our city, her father's slaves, old
friends, and – what is finally revealed – lovers. Encaerus confesses
the shameful act: a vile slave of Canopus, mighty with the sistrum and
his art, has made an ambush in your marriage-bed. These, though quiet,
are always your enemies and they are stirring up the mob with the sound
of a double-edged word, that they are armed to replace the offspring of
the Claudian house among paternal laurels, and they restore to her
husband one who, great with child, swells with dread hopes of
rule.</cell></row>
<row><cell>Nero:</cell><cell>Is she pregnant, who as the companion of our bed bore
nothing, did not even conceive in these ten years?</cell></row>
<row><cell>Poppaea:</cell><cell>So (says) the doubtful rumour of the mob, nor does
that seem wonderful to me. She would have borne a child before now had
she chastely kept to your bed alone. As it is, her practice of fickle
desire and her lascivious passion of lost debauchery towards all men
produced a miscarriage. Lust has made whatever vice there is in her. If
you doubt, Nero, the thing itself shows what is happening: she
conceives, after she sees what crime is charged against her without
offspring. If you ask where the child comes from, alas for the sacred
laws of marriage<lb/> On this side a slave, on the other a sailor struggle
in turn for the place of its father and, what is the lasting disgrace,
Encaerus wants to be his own and Anicetus his own, the base fosterling
whom soon, at his mother's will, an armed band will summon unto the
august house of the Caesars, having cast out your own child and true
offspring. Who can bear such a great crime? They will give over the
reins of power to be held by that same (base child).</cell></row>
<row><cell>Nero:</cell><cell>Stop crying, my wife: your sorrow is justified and my
wrath ever weak. But it will be corrected: surely she will not get away
with this, by whose unspeakable coition our entire house is polluted,
who foists off her bastards on me and intends my empire for her by-
blow? Now I see that the child has gained understanding of a depraved
mother and learned to renew an ancient shameful act from the
illustrious example of her mother: the mother married Silius, she
rushes into the mutual embrace of Anicetus. The crime of each is equal
and deserves an equal punishment. Will Nero yield in vengeance to her
father Claudius? Will he spare the incestuous exile who did not spare
his own mother? After so many noble youths and old men, a brother, and
a mother had been given over to various deaths, will he so far desist
from rage, unmindful of his character and theirs? She will feel my
blow. An emperor has not only islands: he has also axes, prisons,
hooks, and crosses. This inciter of the mob against my head,
adulteress, exile, and barren woman – will she nourish my fears
besides? Go first of all, I command, and free your emperor from this
fear! As long as she breathes and draws breath, the people will not
find rest: they wish her dead.</cell></row>
<row><cell>Messenger:</cell><cell>Let anyone who praises human affairs or being
powerful rejoices in proud things behold the last progeny and fall of
the Claudian house. Scarcely ever has fortune provided greater
lessons.</cell></row>

Rufrius Crispinus was pretorian prefect under Claudius and Poppaea's
first husband. According to Tacitus, Octavia, Nero's first wife, was so
popular that, when a rumour circulated that Nero was going to bring her
back from exile as his wife, the city mob tore down Poppaea's statues.
Rubellius Plautus was a cousin of Nero who was descended in the same
degree from Augustus whom he had put to death on a charge of treason.
Silius was a lover of Octavia's mother, Messalina, with whom she
underwent a form of marriage while Claudius was elsewhere.

        <div>
          <p>The <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40453/" type="Drama_Type">play’s</rs> connection with <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/106806/" type="Place_Feature">Winchester College</rs> is based on the epilogue’s reference to the college’s founder, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/87704/" type="Person_Clergy">William Wykeham</rs> (<hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1324–1404). William also founded <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/219573/" type="Place_Feature">New College</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/73905/" type="Place_Feature">Oxford</rs>, but it is more likely that the play was performed at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/79157/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Winchester</rs>, where the records attest to unnamed performances by the scholars from the 1560s to the 1590s. Plays appear to have been comparatively rare at New College, and no records of performance there exist for the period 1553 to 1603, when <title><rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215175/" type="Drama_TitledWork">Pelopidarum secunda</rs></title> must have been performed, as the epilogue also mentions <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/11772/" type="Person_Royalty">the queen</rs> (for the records of New College, see John R. Elliott, Jr, <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>, <title>Oxford</title>, vol 1, REED (Toronto and Buffalo, 2004). The play is also linked to Winchester by the fact that other compositions in verse in Harley MS 5110 have been attributed to <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/218259/" type="Person_Commoner">Christopher Johnson</rs>, who was <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/17037/" type="Collective_Occupation">headmaster</rs> of Winchester College from 1560 to 1571. We know from his ‘<ref target=" https://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/collections/hamps/appendix-1/">Dictates</ref>,’ recorded by student <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/219137/" type="Person_Commoner">William Badger</rs>, that Johnson promoted play performances by the scholars during his tenure.</p>
          <p>The epilogue suggests that the play was not originally written to be performed: it was ‘Somwhat thought on for private exercise/ But never thought for your eares fitt enough.’ That the play was performed at least once is clear, though, from the beginning of the epilogue, which addresses ‘noble sirs &amp; most kind audience,’ and the ending that asks for their approbation. The closing lines mention William Wykeham and twice refer to the audience as ‘founders’ — ‘founders of o<ex>u</ex>r credit’ and ‘founders of a colledge praise’ — suggesting that the play was performed as part of the college’s annual Founder’s Day celebration on 21 December (for the date of Founder’s Day, see Kirby, <title>Annals of Winchester College</title>, pp 155, 310).</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <head>Date and Authorship</head>
          <p>Neither the performance mentioned in the epilogue nor the play text itself can be dated very precisely. At top of the first leaf of the MS (f 1) and the first leaf of the play (f 27) is the date ‘16 October, 1725’ in a hand much later than those of the texts in the MS. This is the date the MS was acquired for the Harley library. The two speeches by the queen contained in the MS were delivered in 1592 and 1597, and the copies are in secretary hand and made in the 1590s or early 17th century. Of the performances mentioned in the college bursars’ accounts, only those for the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/41461/" type="CalendarDay_Liturgical">Christmas season</rs> of 1573/4 mention tragedy —‘<ref target=" https://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/records/hamps-ridp243891888/">ludis comediar<ex>um</ex> et tragediaru<ex>m</ex></ref>’ — while comedy is mentioned several times, but performances that do not appear in the accounts were given in other years. (If the killing of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215259/" type="Drama_Character">Aerope</rs> is a veiled reference to the killing of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/44850/" type="Person_Royalty">Mary, queen of Scots</rs>, the play as we now have it must date after February 1587, but the first two scenes could have been added after that date to a play written earlier.) The mention of the queen in the play’s epilogue appears to limit the date of the performance to 1553—1603. The several hands of the play text (including that of the epilogue) are also mainly secretary, though with some italic forms, and thus also suggest a date of the late-sixteenth to early-seventeenth century.</p>
          <p>Although the manuscript does not carry the name of an author, the epilogue gives the impression that it was written by someone connected with the college. The several hands of the manuscript may have been those of Winchester scholars, but the text itself does not vary so much in style and quality as to suggest that the play was a collaborative composition by the boys. It is tempting to attribute the play to Christopher Johnson (<hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1536—97), given his promotion of drama during his tenure as headmaster at Winchester College from 1560 to 1571, and the fact that the MS (Harley 5110) contains other works attributed to him. Johnson was a gifted Latinist, who wrote poetry about the school and its founder. His rendering of the pseudo-Homeric <title>Batrachomyomachia</title> ('Battle of the Frogs and Mice') into Latin verse was much admired on its publication in 1580. The Latin dialogue between Nero and Poppea that appears in his ‘<ref target=" https://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/collections/hamps/appendix-1/">Dictates</ref>' may also be Johnson’s own work. On the other hand, the only playwrights mentioned in Johnson’s ‘Dictates’ are the Roman comic playwrights <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/218462/" type="Person_Male">Terence</rs> and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/218515/" type="Person_Male">Plautus</rs>, and nothing resembling the <title>Pelopidarum</title> is mentioned there, nor is there evidence of Johnson producing original works in English.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <head>The Play</head>
          <p><title>Pelopidarum secunda</title> is a verse tragedy in English that tells the familiar story of Agamemnon’s murder by his wife, Clytemnestra, and her lover Aegisthus, who are in turn killed in revenge by Orestes and his sister Electra. The Latin title is ambiguous. Martin Wiggins suggests the name might mean that there was a <title>Pelopidarum prima</title>, ‘presumably centring on Thyestes and perhaps taking the story as far as Iphigenia? The Atreus/Aeropa sequence in the early scenes certainly appears extraneous to this play’s main focus, and could be a hangover from a lost first part. However, “secunda” might alternatively refer to the second generation of Pelopidae’ (<title>British Drama</title>, vol 3: <title>1590–1597</title>, p 1).</p>
          <p>The play has a total of 3,465 lines, including the fifty-line epilogue (but excluding stage directions). The dialogue scenes are in iambic pentameter, mostly blank verse, while the choruses use lines varying from as few as two stresses to as many as six, some of which rhyme in couplets. The choruses occasionally use unison speaking, but more often are composed of a series of individual speeches by four or five characters who play no other part in the action.</p>
          <p>The play has the large cast typical of academic drama: thirty-six speaking parts, as well as a number of non-speaking attendants. The two main women have the longest parts in the play: Clytemnestra has 476 lines, Electra 436. Orestes has the longest part of the men at 354 lines, followed distantly by Eurysthenes with 225 lines and Aegisthus with 190. (The idea that the title, <title>Pelopidarum secunda</title>, refers to the second generation of Pelops’ descendants is undercut by the fact that the second generation is represented by Aegisthus (Thyestes’ son) and Agamemnon (Atreus’ son), and Aegisthus’ part is only the fifth largest and Agamemon’s the tenth largest, at only ninety lines.)</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <head>Sources</head>
          <p><title>Pelopidarum</title> is based on two classical sources, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/219199/" type="Person_Male">Seneca</rs>’s <title><rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/219258/" type="Drama_TitledWork">Agamemnon</rs></title> and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/219285/" type="Person_Male">Sophocles</rs>’ <title><rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/219320/" type="Drama_TitledWork">Electra</rs></title>, but it adapts rather than merely translating those works. Some scenes follow the sources closely, while others are much expanded or condensed. Atreus’ trick to get Clytemnestra and Agathia to strangle Aerope in the second scene appears to be invented by the author and if partly in the spirit of Seneca is closer to the horrific violence of <title>The Spanish Tragedy</title> or <title>The Revenger’s Tragedy</title>.</p>
          <p>Another brief section that does not occur in either source does appear in other classical sources and has been considerably displaced chronologically from its ancient place in the story. The <title>Pelopidarum</title> places the killing of Atreus by Aegisthus between Agamemnon’s return from Troy and his murder by Aegisthus and Clytemnestra. The ancient sources say that Aegisthus killed Atreus much earlier, before Aegisthus and his father Thyestes expelled Agamemnon and Menelaus from Mycenae and ruled there as joint kings. Only later did Agamemnon recover the throne of Mycenae, lead the Greek expedition to Troy, and return after ten more years to be murdered. The killing of Atreus is dramatically ineffective when placed where it is, since it intrudes on the audience’s anticipation of the killing of Agamemnon. Perhaps the author meant to emphasize the theme of the inevitable punishment of evil actions, by having Aegisthus take revenge on both father (Atreus) and son (Agamemnon) in successive scenes.</p>

          <head>Synopsis</head>
          
          <p>The play’s first two scenes have no counterpart in Seneca’s <title>Agamemnon</title>. 1.1 is a soliloquy by <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215193/" type="Drama_Character">Hipparchus</rs>, who explains that <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215215/" type="Drama_Character">Atreus</rs> is haunted by the ghost of his brother <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215237/" type="Drama_Character">Thyestes</rs>, and furious over the unfaithfulness of his wife, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215259/" type="Drama_Character">Aerope</rs>, with his brother. Atreus aims to get revenge on Aerope by means of the trick that forms the following scene. In 1.2 Atreus tells <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215281/" type="Drama_Character">Clytemnestra</rs> and her maid <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215303/" type="Drama_Character">Agathia</rs> that a witch named <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215325/" type="Drama_Character">Dipsas</rs> is keeping Thyestes’ ghost from rest, and asks their help in interrogating her. When he brings the witch in it is actually Aerope with her face covered. Atreus ties a cord around Aerope’s forehead and gives the two ends to Clytemnestra and Agathia to pull on, in order to torture the witch into confessing. Before they pull, however, Atreus suggests the women avert their eyes. He then pulls the cord down to Aerope’s neck, and when the two women pull, they strangle Aerope. Atreus exults, the women wail, and Agathia suicides.  Clytemnestra grabs the knife to kill herself, but drops it when the ghost of Thyestes appears. (Classicist David Lupher, University of Puget Sound, has confirmed to the editors in an email that there is no classical source for this episode. In fact, no ancient source tells how Aerope died.)</p>
          
          <p>1.3 involves Thyestes’ ghost giving what is the prologue of Seneca’s <title>Agamemnon</title>, and his speech sticks fairly closely to Seneca, though it explicitly names figures (Ixion, Sisyphus, etc) that in Seneca are identified only by their well-known punishments. Seneca’s chorus at this point is left out, but the next scene (1.4) follows the source, as Clytemnestra tells her women of her love of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215347/" type="Drama_Character">Aegisthus</rs> and hatred of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215369/" type="Drama_Character">Agamemnon</rs>, and Aegisthus enters to argue with her over the plot to murder Agamemnon. The chorus that closes Act 1 has no counterpart in Seneca. The <title>Pelopidarum</title> chorus recalls the murder of Aerope, linking it to Clytemnestra’s intent to kill Agamemnon.</p>
          
          <p>The first part of Act 2 is based on Seneca’s Act 3, and begins with Clytemnestra solo, before <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215391/" type="Drama_Character">Eurybates</rs> arrives to announce Agamemnon’s imminent arrival and relate the travails the returning Greeks have suffered on the seas. Eurybates is followed by captive Trojan women, who tell of their suffering. Agamemnon arrives home in a scene misnumbered as Act 4 (probably because the play has reached Act 4 of its source). He exults, gives brief thanks to the gods at altar, is warned by <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215413/" type="Drama_Character">Cassandra</rs>, and goes into the palace. Then comes a short scene with no analogue in Seneca, in which Atreus enters to pray at the altar, but is killed by Aegisthus, who has sneaked in behind him. Cassandra has a long solo speech describing Agamemnon’s going to bed, and the scene then shifts to his bedroom, with a brief dialogue about putting on a shirt given him by Clytemnestra. Clytemnestra and Aegisthus enter and kill Agamemnon with a single stab by Aegisthus. The murder is handled very differently from Seneca, where Aegisthus is portrayed as weak, and Clytemnestra has to take the axe from him to hew off Agamemnon’s head. The chorus that ends Act 2 retells the action, including the killing of Atreus, but adds no particular commentary on the events.</p>
          
          <p>The story of spiriting Orestes away, from the end of the Seneca, is left out, and Act 3 begins with the first episode of Sophocles’ <title>Electra</title>, as <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215435/" type="Drama_Character">Electra</rs> complains of her fate to a group of women supporters (named individuals taking the place of Sophocles’ chorus). <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215457/" type="Drama_Character">Chrysothenis</rs> enters to debate the situation with Electra, the dialogue closely paralleling the one in Sophocles. Then comes a short scene not in Sophocles, in which <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215479/" type="Drama_Character">Strophius</rs> reassures Electra that he has kept Orestes safe. Electra and Clytemnesta argue about the killing of Agamemnon in a condensed version of the Sophocles scene. Clytemnestra wants to kill Electra but Aegisthus (who is not an onstage character in Sophocles) says that since Electra desires death, it will punish her more severely to imprison her instead. Then Cassandra (likewise not in Sophocles) is condemned by Clytemnestra and Aegisthus, and they kill her offstage. (This scenelet lessens the impact of the punishment of Electra). A chorus of the captive women laments Cassandra’s death. A chorus (labelled Act 4 but in fact the end of Act 3) does not follow Sophocles’ chorus at all, but does generalize in suggesting that the events are all the gods’ will.</p>
          
          <p>Act 4 (mislabelled Act 5, Scene 1) begins with <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215501/" type="Drama_Character">Euristhenes</rs> (called Pedagogus in Sophocles) reminding <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215523/" type="Drama_Character">Orestes</rs> how Euristhenes saved him and brought him up. Orestes tells Euristhenes to go to Electra and say Orestes is dead, while he deals with Clytemnestra and Aegisthus. However, in a scene not in the source, Orestes hesitates and engages in dialogue with <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215545/" type="Drama_Character">Pilades</rs> about their mutual support and love. A new scene finds Clytemnestra expressing her fears of her children, while Aegisthus tries to comfort her. He leaves and she has a brief outburst of passion but soothes herself by calling for a song, the only music indicated in the play. The rest of the act follows Sophocles, as Euristhenes tells Clytemnestra and Electra a story about Orestes’ death in a chariot race at the Pythian Games. Electra remains and is joined by Chrysothenis, who believes the offerings at their father’s tomb indicate that Orestes is alive and has returned. Electra responds with Euristhenes’ news of Orestes’ death and urges Chrysothenis to join her in killing Aegisthus and Clytemnestra, but Chrysothenis refuses. The chorus that ends Act 4 basically recaps the action of the act, but is distinctive in form, with stage directions that indicate that the chorus first speaks at the east, then the west, and finally in the midst, apparently imitating the classical choral structure of strophe, antistrophe, and epode.</p>
          
          <p>Act 5 begins with a scene not in Sophocles, in which Euristhenes urges Orestes not to spare his mother. Pilades agrees, reminding Orestes of Apollo’s oracles that commanded he kill both his father’s murderers. Orestes still resists killing his mother, and feels either course will be impiety, but eventually the other two convince him. When Electra enters Orestes pretends to be a stranger bringing Orestes’s ashes, then reveals himself by showing her Agamemnon’s ring. </p>
          
          <p>The next section follows Sophocles fairly closely. The two siblings then work each other up to the killing of their mother in a lengthy exchange of single lines. Clytemnestra enters and pleads for her life, but Orestes is now determined and kills her. Aegisthus is then tricked by Orestes’ bringing out Clytemnestra’s body and saying it is Orestes’s, making Aegisthus look beneath the cover. Orestes reveals his true identity and kills Aegisthus. (The killing takes place on stage, unlike in its Greek source.) Sophocles’ <title>Electra</title> then ends rapidly with short speeches by Orestes and the chorus that claim justice has been done. But in <title>Pelopidarum</title> Orestes is immediately wracked by guilt and beset by ghosts — of Clytemnestra and Aegisthus, but also of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215567/" type="Drama_Character">Tesiphone</rs> and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215589/" type="Drama_Character">Cerberus</rs>. Although Orestes is tormented by ghosts rather than the Furies, the playwright here seems to be paralleling Aeschylus’ version of the story.</p>
          
          <p>The final chorus is the only one to really comment on the events, recapping the events and characters of the play, as the earlier choruses do, but also repeating the lines ‘Earthe vnawares consenteth to the skyes’ and ‘god<ex>es</ex> will have offenders blinde.’ The ending thus emphasizes the human inability to foresee the future or grasp the big picture. Orestes’ matricide is not called justice, as it is in Sophocles, but misguided, and the chorus argues that all Greece</p>   
          
          <quote><p>may iustly repent thy iust revenginge.<lb/>
            Thus we wishe for a thinge, to loath it after:<lb/>

            And disturbe not a peace the cyttie stayed.<lb/>
            Crownes are frayle, nor a bide the safe removinge</p></quote>
          
          <p>This chorus thus moves the play from academic classicism to commentary on English politics. Like <title>Gorboduc</title>, <title>Pelopidarum secunda</title> shows the explosion of violence and bloodshed that killing the king sets in motion. It could be applicable to almost any time during Elizabeth’s reign, but if it were associated with Christopher Johnson’s mastership in the 1560s, it would speak to those upset with the recently crowned Elizabeth, especially in the area around Winchester, where resistance to Protestantism was strong.</p>
          
          <p>Another intriguing possibility is that the invented scene of the killing of Aerope might be a veiled reference to Elizabeth’s part in the killing of Mary, queen of Scots. Though suggesting a parallel between Elizabeth and Clytemnestra might seem a dangerous move by the playwright, he depicts Clytemnestra as distressed at her part in killing a kinswoman, and absolves her of guilt by showing that she was tricked into complicity by the deceitful Atreus.</p>
          
          <p>Whether or not the play intended to comment on recent events, it appears to belong to the fashion for revenge tragedy, which would date it closer to the end of Elizabeth’s reign than the beginning. Though the author can hardly match Marlowe or Shakespeare as a poet, one may hear faint echoes or anticipations in lines like Storge’s ‘Bringinge the Captiue dames of Phrygia,' which suggests Tamburlaine’s ‘Holla, ye pamper’d Jades of <title>Asia</title>’ (<title>Tamburlaine the Great, Part 2</title>, <title>The Complete Works of Christopher Marlowe</title>, David Fuller and Edward J. Esche (eds), vol 5 (Oxford, 1998), 4.3.1). The play’s reflections on the cost, both social and personal, of pursuing revenge serve to emphasize Shakespeare’s much greater achievement in <title>Hamlet</title>.</p>

          <head>The Manuscript</head>
          
          <p>In addition to the play, the volume contains two Latin speeches by Queen Elizabeth, one to the heads of Oxford University and another rebuking the Polish Ambassador, as well as copies of Donne’s Satires I — III, the arguments of the Psalms in verse, and a paraphrase of the Proverbs of Solomon in couplets.</p>
          
          <p>The hands of different copyists divide the play text into seventeen sections. The speech headings and stage directions appear to have been added by two different hands (I and II), in either black (B) or red (R) ink, and generally in an italic script intended to contrast with the secretary used for the spoken parts. The modern pencil foliation is continuous through the manuscript, while the original ink foliation is intermittent. Some folios also carry cancelled ink foliation (in parentheses below).</p>

            <p>*The ink foliation skips over pencil f 54.</p>
            
            <p>The two longest sections (13 and 16) appear to be by the same hand, and are written neatly with few corrections. Section 13a may have been added by the same writer as the stage directions designated by ‘I,’ but all the other sections seem to be by different hands. This large number of different hands, many of them copying only one or two folios, suggests that the scholars were employed as copyists, with a supervising master or two organizing the project and providing the stage directions. Why this was done — whether as a classroom exercise or in order to create additional copies of the play — cannot be discerned.</p>
            
            <p>The manuscript has been repaired so that each leaf is glued to a modern stub leaf attached to the binding, which prevents us from learning anything from how the leaves were gathered. The uncancelled ink foliation of sections 13 and 16 accurately continues the cancelled ink foliation of sections 2, 5, and 6, suggesting that other copies of the intervening sections existed at some time. The uncancelled ink foliation of sections 2—10 indicate an attempt to foliate the play by itself (apart from any texts on preceding leaves) and probably represent a somewhat later stage of the manuscript, with the current sections 3, 4, and 7 to 10 replacing earlier copies of those parts of the play. Whether sections 11 to 17 were all included in an earlier stage of the manuscript cannot be determined, since the ink foliation was abandoned after section 10. The epilogue seems to have been added at the end of section 16 after the rest was complete, though not much later, as the hand is similar in date to those in the rest of the manuscript.</p>
            
            <p>One can only conjecture how the manuscript may have come to take its present form. One possibility is that sections 13 and 16 are the oldest, the work either of the playwright himself or a professional copyist. Then a number of the Winchester College scholars may have been given the task of copying parts of the play, and their work substituted for the original folios containing those sections. A second possibility is that two or more complete copies of the play existed around 1600, and someone later created the current composite manuscript, perhaps choosing the sections that were in the best condition.</p>

this context. Ceyx was king of Trachis and the couple were both
beautiful and very much in love. They took to referring to themselves
as Zeus and Hera, which angered the gods. When Ceyx was traveling by
ship to consult the oracle of Apollo, Zeus hit the ship with a
thunderbolt and Ceyx was drowned. Alcyone threw herself into the sea in
grief, but the gods were so impressed by the intensity of the couple's
love that Zeus transformed them into kingfishers (halcyon birds). This
allusion, and those to Procne and Philomela, are taken from
Seneca.</hi></note></cell></row>

          <p><rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/219405/" type="Person_Commoner">Thomas Warton</rs>’s <title>History of English Poetry</title> contains records and stories concerning early dramatic and musical activity in <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/79157/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Winchester</rs>, many of which have been repeated by later scholars (see, for example, Chambers, <title>Medieval Stage</title>, vol 1, pp 56, 361). A number of these that concern the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/21537/" type="Drama_Character">boy bishop</rs> at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/106806/" type="Place_Feature">Winchester College</rs> come from manuscripts that survive in the College Archives and are among the records from the college included in this collection. Unfortunately, the sources that Warton cites for some of his most interesting stories cannot now be found and may, in fact, have never existed. Certainly the suspect records give the initial appearance of being genuine. Warton gives likely sounding names for his manuscript sources, though not always where he found the manuscripts. He frequently gives what purport to be the original texts of the records, in Latin. The records thus appear to be too precise and detailed to be fabrications. However, scholars have found evidence that Warton did indeed engage in elaborate fabrication. H.E.D. Blakiston has carefully analyzed Warton’s quotations from Machyn’s Diary (BL: Cotton Vitellius F. 5) in the <title>History of English Poetry</title> and <title>The Life of Sir Thomas Pope, Founder of Trinity College Oxford</title>, 2nd ed (London, 1780) (‘Thomas Warton and Machyn’s Diary,’ English Historical Review 11, no 42 (April 1896), 282–300). Some of the passages quoted by Warton have indeed been transcribed from Machyn’s Diary, though Warton’s transcriptions show minor inaccuracies. But one lengthy passage, which describes the entertainments Sir Thomas Pope provided for Princess Elizabeth at Hatfield during Shrovetide 1556/7, including a play of Holofernes, does not appear anywhere in the extant manuscript of Machyn’s Diary. Warton offers a lengthy and complicated explanation, stating that because the manuscript had been badly damaged in the fire in Cotton’s library, he had to work from a transcript of the diary made by John Strype before the fire. Blakiston, however, argues that the manuscript was not damaged nearly as badly as Warton suggests, and further points out that the section of Machyn’s Diary covering Shrovetide 1556/7, when the play and other entertainments for Princess Elizabeth supposedly took place, is not damaged and ‘the entries from 26 Feb. to 18 March are continuous on a single leaf of the manuscript’ (Blakiston, ‘Thomas Warton,’ pp 289, 293–4, 297–9; my own examination of Machyn’s Diary confirms Blakiston’s observations).</p>
          <p>The evidence that the Hampshire records in this appendix are fabrications is less certain than Blakiston’s evidence concerning the passages supposedly taken from Machyn’s Diary. Warton often visited his brother <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/219468/" type="Person_Clergy">Joseph</rs>, headmaster of Winchester College, which gave him ready access to the college documents he used. He could well have used other Winchester documents, such as the Winchester diocesan records held by the bishop, and of course some of those documents might have been lost or destroyed in the two-and-half centuries since Warton wrote. What makes the records suspect is the very detail that makes them so attractive. Most records are laconic and matter of fact; scribes of official documents recorded only as much detail as was necessary for the purpose of the document. The records Warton quotes from surviving documents fit that pattern: records concerning the boy bishops at Winchester College include a payment in the bursar’s accounts for the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/41365/" type="CalendarDay_Liturgical">feast of the Holy Innocents</rs> 1405 – ‘dat<ex>is</ex> per Epis<ex>copu</ex>m pu<ex>er</ex>or<ex>um</ex> ij s. viij d.’ – and an entry in a 1432 college inventory for a cross on a staff for the boy bishop – ‘It<ex>e</ex>m alia crux de cupro deaurat<ex>o</ex> cu<ex>m</ex> bac<ex>u</ex>l<ex>is</ex> p<ex>ro</ex> Ep<ex>iscop</ex>o in die innocent<ex>ium</ex>’ (see <ref target="https://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/records/hamps-ridp241492592/">Winchester College Bursars' Accounts, 1405–6</ref>, and <ref target="https://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/records/hamps-ridp242178608/">Winchester College Inventory, 1432</ref>).</p>  
          <p>The suspect records, in stark contrast, are so detailed as to be almost chatty, offering a wealth of the sort of information we would most like to know about what was performed, how, and by whom. But we find such information only rarely, and then in personal letters or journals, not in official records of the kind Warton claimed were his sources. Such documents might occasionally tell us a minstrel’s name, but not the subjects of what he sung, nor where he did it (which would have been obvious, and thus of little interest to the clerk doing the recording). So one reads with initial excitement, but also a good deal of suspicion, a record that tells us that in 1338 a minstrel named Herbert sang of the Danish giant, Colbrond, and also of Queen Emma (both local Winchester stories) in the prior’s hall. Or that two different groups of boy choristers dressed up like girls to perform in the refectory for the nuns of St Mary’s Abbey in 1441. The first of these records supposedly came from a register of the priors of St Swithun’s (a source Warton gives for several of the suspect records), the second from an account roll, neither of them documents in which we would expect to find unnecessary details (<title>History of English Poetry</title>, vol 1, p 89; vol 3, pp 323–5).</p> 
          <p>In his ‘Preface,’ Warton argues that ‘a history of poetry ... must be more especially productive of entertainment and utility,’ and ‘anecdotes of the rudiments of a favourite art will always be particularly pleasing’ (<title>History of English Poetry</title>, pp ii–iii). His aim, he says, was to construct his history as a continuous narrative: ‘I have chose to exhibit the history of our poetry in a chronological series: not distributing my matter into detached articles, of periodical divisions, or of general heads’ (p iii). He asks readers’ indulgence for the fact that ‘the citations in the first volume are numerous, and sometimes very prolix. But it should be remembered, that most of these are extracted from antient manuscript poems never before printed, and hitherto but little known. Nor was it easy to illustrate the darker and more distant periods of our poetry, without producing ample specimens’ (p viii). We can perhaps grasp here the motivation for inventing specimens to fill gaps in the narrative when few documents have survived and those that have are frustratingly uninformative in their terseness. Certainly his extensive research in manuscript sources and his training in Latin gave him the skills he needed to create records and manuscript references that would seem authentic. The passages below have thus been included in this appendix, rather than in the main records text, and any use of them by scholars needs to take into account the concerns about their authenticity outlined here.</p>

                appears to have been a practice for itinerant players to gain
                admittance into the nunneries, and to play Latin MYSTERIES before the
                nuns. There is a curious Canon of the COUNCIL of COLOGNE, in 1549,
                which is to this effect. "We have been informed, that certain Actors of
                Comedies, not contented with the stage and theaters, have even entered
                the nunneries, in order to recreate the nuns, <foreign xml:lang="lat">ubi virginibus

                consisted of sacred and pious subjects, can yet notwithstanding leave
                little good, but on the contrary much harm, in the minds of the nuns,
                who behold and admire the outward gestures of the performers, and
                understand not the words. Therefore we decree, that henceforward no
                Plays, <foreign xml:lang="lat">Comedias,</foreign> shall be admitted into the convents of nuns,
