      <projectDesc>
        <p>Records of Early English Drama (REED) is an international scholarly project that is
          establishing for the first time the context from which the drama of Shakespeare and his
          contemporaries grew. Founded in 1976, REED has worked since then to locate, transcribe,
          and edit historical documents containing evidence of drama, secular music, and other
          communal entertainment and ceremony from the Middle Ages until 1642, when the Puritans
          closed the London theatres.</p>

          <p>Every REED edition is a collaboration and I want to begin by thanking my number one
            collaborator, my co-editor and great friend, Jane Cowling. We worked together on and off
            on this project for a quarter century, and I very much regret that she did not live to
            participate in its final completion and publication on REED Online. Jane and I did not
            know each other at the beginning of the project, but Jane welcomed me into her home in
            Titchfield, helped me find my own place to live, and introduced me to Hampshire and to
            the local scholarly community. We divided up the editorial work by locality: Jane worked
            on the city of Winchester, Winchester College, Portsmouth, and the Isle of Wight; I took
            Southampton and the rest of the county. Jane did all the searching for records,
            transcribing and much of the editing for the locations she chose. She wrote the
            introductory material for the Winchester College records, and the rest of the
            introductions and apparatus incorporate much that she wrote, especially for Winchester
            and the Isle of Wight. Although we worked independently much of the time, we met often
            when I was in England to share our findings and work out knotty problems ‚Äî usually in
            the evening, over ‚Äòa glass of something‚Äô (as Jane would put it, pulling out a bottle
            acquired on her most recent trip to France). I miss her greatly and want to dedicate
            this finished Hampshire edition to her memory.</p>

          <p>This edition would not have been possible without financial support from a number of
            sources. I received several travel grants from the University of Puget Sound, as well as
            from the National Endowment for the Humanities. Both Jane and I received fellowships
            from the Hartley Library at the University of Southampton, and Jane also received
            support from the British Academy. The work of REED‚Äôs central editorial office has been
            supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Social Science and Research
            Council of Canada, and Father Edward Jackman and the Jackman Foundation of Toronto. We
            are both extremely grateful to these funders for their generosity.</p>

          <p>The records in this collection come from a number of archives: the Hampshire Record
            Office, the Winchester College Archives, the Southampton City Archives, the Isle of
            Wight Record Office, The National Archives, the British Library, the Surrey History
            Centre, the Portsmouth City Museum and Records Office, the Winchester Cathedral Library,
            the Salisbury Cathedral Archives, the Bodleian Library, and the archives of Corpus
            Christi College, Oxford. We wish to thank all these repositories for the permission to
            publish excerpts from their holdings. We also wish to thank Mr John Jervoise for
            permission to study and publish records from the wonderfully rich Jervoise of Herriard
            Collection deposited at the Hampshire Record Office, and Ms Fanny Oglander for
            permission to publish excerpts from the writing of her ancestor, Sir John Oglander, on
            deposit at the Isle of Wight Record Office.</p>

          <p>We wish to thank all the staff of these archives for their patient assistance over the
            thirty years it has taken to produce this edition. REED editors are literary
            archaeologists, and we have had to scrape away a good deal of dirt to find the
            occasional shard that can add to our history of early drama. We owe much to the people
            who, day after day, have brought us bucketloads of documents, taken them away again,
            cared for the documents in the meantime, and sometimes helped us to tell shard from
            dirt. In particular we wish to thank, at the Hampshire Record Office, Gill Rushton,
            Caroline Humphries, David Rymill, and especially Sarah Lewin, who helped us launch our
            research at the beginning and many years later helped us pull it together in our
            Hampshire Paper. Roger Custance and Suzanne Foster aided our researches at Winchester
            College, as did Sue Woolgar and Andrew George at the Southampton City Archives, John
            Hardacre at Winchester Cathedral Library, and Julian Reid at Corpus Christi College,
            Oxford. Chris Woolgar of the University of Southampton advised us on research,
            administered our Hartley Fellowships, and generously shared the early kingale record of
            Andover he discovered buried in coroners‚Äô reports at The National Archives.</p>

          <p>We also want to express our gratitude to a number of other scholars who have helped us
            along the way. Tom James of the University of Winchester shared preliminary research he
            had done on dramatic records of Southampton and provided helpful suggestions for our
            Hampshire Paper. Ernest Blake of the University of Southampton checked translations of
            some difficult Latin records included in Jane‚Äôs doctoral thesis. Martin Wiggins of the
            Shakespeare Institute made a number of helpful suggestions about records of Sir Richard
            Paulet and also directed our attention to an unpublished play connected to Winchester
            College. Robert Tittler provided historical perspective throughout the project and read
            an early draft of the historical introduction. James Gibson checked on some Hampshire
            records in the Kent archives, and allowed us to reprint in this Hampshire collection his
            editing (for REED Kent, Diocese of Canterbury) of the Visitatio Sepulchri from the
            Regularis Concordia and the Winchester Troper. Others who have contributed useful
            suggestions and references include Ed Cueva, David Lupher, Bill Cooke, Richard Rastall,
            Cheryl Butler, David Freemantle, Lynn Forest-Hill, and the anonymous reviewers of the
            proofs of this project. Our especial thanks go to John McGavin of the University of
            Southampton, who was a great mentor to Jane as supervisor of her doctoral thesis and who
            has encouraged and supported both of us through the long life of this project.</p>

          <p>The staff of the REED Office at the University of Toronto has contributed immeasurably
            to this project. Patrick Gregory did paleographical checking of the transcriptions and
            provided most of the Latin translation. Kathy Chung did the indexing, tagging the
            entities to make the records searchable. Tanya Hagen checked the bibliographic
            references in the apparatus and provided leads to new records. The meticulous work of
            those three not only ensured the accuracy of the records and apparatus, but also, by
            turning fresh and perceptive eyes on material that had become over-familiar to me, they
            pushed me to add fuller explanations of the records to the apparatus and to see
            connections in the evidence I had not previously noticed. Early in the research process
            we had bibliographical support from Theodore de Welles and Miriam Skey, and Abigail Ann
            Young helped Jane with the Latin of some of the Winchester College documents.</p>

          <p>Paleographical checking of documents at archives in the UK was done by Stephanie
            Hovland, aided by Merel Veldhuizen, Alan Nelson, and Sally-Beth MacLean. In Toronto, a
            number of research assistants contributed to the project: Alexandra Atiya worked on
            bibliographic support, Janine Harper on the English glossary, Cai Henderson on Latin
            paleography and translation, Jan√© Jacobs on mapping, and Morgan Moore on patrons
            research. Carolyn Black provided overall management for the project, coordinating the
            work of this whole REED team, as well as doing proofreading and coding. Jamie Norrish is
            the programmer and developer for the REED Online platform.</p>

          <p>Jane and I want to thank Alexandra Johnston, founder of Records of Early English Drama,
            and Sally-Beth MacLean, Director of Research and General Editor, for their trust and
            support throughout the life of this project. They took both of us on when we were only
            graduate students, and through the following decades Sandy and Sally-Beth have been
            mentors, valued research colleagues, and dear friends.</p>

          <p>Finally, I want to thank my children, Dinah and Toby, who endured (and perhaps even
            enjoyed) having significant portions of their childhoods dislocated to Hampshire. My
            wife, Sandra Dahlberg, accompanied me on research trips, put aside her own research at
            times to help me by combing through catalogues and photographing manuscripts, and
            listened patiently to my soliloquies on matters often of interest only to REED editors.
            Her companionship and enthusiasm have been crucial to keeping me going over the many
            years it has taken to bring the Hampshire records to publication.</p>

            the birthplace of both cricket and Jane Austen, as well as the launching place of the

            the River Itchen ‚Äì that best convey the character of the county. Hampshire is among the
            largest English counties by area and today is one of the most populous, due to the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/36947/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">London</rs> commuter belt encroaching into the county‚Äôs northeast corner and
            development expanding along the south coast between <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/87185/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Portsmouth</rs> and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/72712/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Southampton</rs>. Even so, much of the county is still
            considered rural. In the medieval and early modern periods Hampshire was thinly
            populated and relatively poor. <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/79157/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Winchester</rs> with its royal associations and Southampton with its port dominated
            the county from the time of the Domesday Survey until Portsmouth began to gain in
            population and importance in the seventeenth century. Winchester and Southampton
            dominate the county‚Äôs history of dramatic activity as well, but several towns and rural
            parishes contribute to that history, as do some of the county‚Äôs aristocratic
              families.<note type="foot">R.S. Schofield ranks Hampshire only in the mid- to low

            The Norman kings travelled back and forth between England and Normandy through
            Southampton. Wool and other needs of the cloth industry moved from Hampshire and the
            surrounding counties across the channel, traded for imports from Italy, Spain, and
            Flanders: wine, dyestuffs, spices, and luxury goods went by cart from Southampton to

          <p>Three kinds of topography dominate the Hampshire landscape: chalk downlands, low-lying
            river basins, and the sea coast. On the east side of the county the South Downs rise
            just north of Portsmouth and continue north to the area around <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/79210/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Alton</rs>, where they angle northwest along the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1751/" type="Place_County">Berkshire</rs> border. On the west side of the county lower hills separate the Test
            watershed from that of the Salisbury Avon in Wiltshire. In the southwestern corner of
            the county the hills disappear and the low-lying New Forest blends into the lower part
            of the Avon watershed. In between, the Hampshire Basin spreads south of the downlands in
            the centre of the county, created by the rivers that drain the downs ‚Äì the Test, Itchen,
            Meon, and their tributaries. The coast provides excellent harbours at Portsmouth and
            Southampton, where the inlets of Portsmouth Harbour and Southampton Water are further
            protected from the worst weather by the Isle of Wight. The Isle itself mirrors the
            topography of the Hampshire mainland, as the northern part is low-lying clay and gravel
            soil while the southern part is hilly and more fertile. The fertile, well-drained areas
            of the county ‚Äì along the Test, Itchen, and Meon rivers, and the hilly southern part of
            the Isle of Wight ‚Äì were much more populous and prosperous than areas with unfavourable
            conditions ‚Äì the acid soil of the New Forest, the higher chalk downlands, and the
            northern part of the Isle of Wight.<note type="foot"> Bettey, <title>Wessex from AD

          <p>Careful farming used the thin soil of the chalk downlands on the land along the stream
            beds. Sheep were pastured on the hills during the day, then brought down to folds near
            the streams at night. Their manure fertilized the fields, creating arable land that
            produced wheat, barley, oats, and peas. Villages in the downs tended to be compact,
            along the streams, with manors long and narrow reaching up from the stream beds to the
            high downlands.<note type="foot"> Bettey, <title>Wessex from AD 1000</title>, pp

          <p>The great estates owned by the bishop of Winchester and by the county‚Äôs monasteries led
            to a great expansion in farming to meet the needs of a population that increased
            steadily from the Conquest through the thirteenth century. Woodlands, marsh, and waste
            land were cleared to bring more land under cultivation and new urban centres sprang up
            with new markets and fairs. The Domesday boroughs of Winchester, Southampton, and
            Portchester were joined by a number of places that had markets and some elements of

          <p>The period of expansion came to an end even before the Black Death. Although the
            woollen industry flourished and some individuals amassed considerable wealth, in general
            the fourteenth century was a period of economic decline.<note type="foot">Farmer,
              'Marketing the Produce,' pp 345‚Äì6.</note> The population had grown to the point where
            the land could sustain those living on it only in favourable years and poor harvests had
            a devastating effect.<note type="foot">'On the estates of the Bishops of Winchester up
              to a third of the men were landless, and the average holding per family less than 2
              acres. . . . Such people were obviously living dangerously close to subsistence level
              and rapidly succumbed to poor harvests, famine and disease‚Äô (Bettey, <title>Wessex
                from AD 1000</title>, p 83).</note> Bad weather and poor harvests in 1315‚Äì17 led to
            wheat prices tripling, followed by plagues among the sheep and cattle. The Black Death
            arrived in 1348 and 1349 and Hampshire suffered as badly as any county in England.
            Almost half of the clergy of Winchester diocese died from plague. On the manor of
            Bishops Waltham 264 tenants died in 1348‚Äì9 out of a total of 404 and another fifty-three
            died when the plague struck again in 1361. Titchfield Abbey‚Äôs estates saw 305 of 515
            tenants die in 1348‚Äì9 and another ninety-two in 1361.<note type="foot">Bettey,

          <p>As elsewhere, the heavy mortality led to the end of customary labour by tenants and a
            rise in labour costs as individuals sold their labour. Individuals could rise from
            bondmen in the fourteenth century to yeomen by the sixteenth. At the same time, the much
            reduced population needed less grain and the combination substantially reduced profits
            from arable farming. Higher prices for wool led to a substantial increase in sheep
            farming and the shifting of much land from arable to sheep pasture until wool prices
            fell in the late 1370s.<note type="foot">Edward Miller, 'The Occupation of the Land: The

            port. Andover, Basingstoke, and Ringwood became regional market centres, especially for

            agriculture that were improving farming in other counties in the sixteenth and early
            seventeenth centuries did not catch on in Hampshire until after the Civil War. Hampshire
            remained a thinly populated county: its population density was thirty-five per cent

            at only a little over 50,000. Winchester and Southampton remained the largest towns, the
            only ones in the county with populations over 2,000. Romsey, Christchurch, Ringwood,
            Newport (Isle of Wight), and Basingstoke had between 1,500 and 2,000 inhabitants, while

            to the city. As much of the county‚Äôs wealth and population in the late Middle Ages was
            located in other parts of the county like the upper Test valley, the city did not
            function as the natural market centre of a wealthy rural area. By the sixteenth century

          <p>Little is known about the beginnings of Christianity in Hampshire, at least at the
            parish level. The Saxons of the region converted in the mid-seventh century and a
            community of secular canons was formed at Winchester‚Äôs Old Minster in 643. In 676
            Winchester became the seat of a bishopric that included the whole of Hampshire and Isle
            of Wight as well as Surrey (and Sussex until 711). According to the Venerable Bede, St
            Wilfred came from Northumbria to convert the South Saxons in the late seventh century,
            establishing churches in the Meon Valley and on the Isle of Wight.<note type="foot"><title>Baedae Opera Historica, vol 2: Ecclesiastical History of the English

            reform and monastic revival of the tenth and eleventh centuries took especially strong
            hold in the Wessex region, with new orders and foundations and a good deal of new
            construction occurring in this period. The miracles ascribed to Swithun, bishop from 852
            to 862, made Winchester a pilgrimage site and when <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/204950/" type="Person_Clergy">Bishop

              Swithun</rs> and the secular canons were replaced by a priory for Benedictine monks.
            The tenth century also saw convents of Benedictine nuns appear at Nunnaminster (<hi rend="italic">c</hi> 900) in Winchester and at Romsey (<hi rend="italic">c</hi> 907),

            (1233), and Barton Oratory on the Isle of Wight (1275). The Isle of Wight also had
            Cistercian monks at Quarr Abbey near Fishbourne from 1131, while on the mainland the
            Cistercians had Beaulieu Abbey, founded by <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/23747/" type="Person_Royalty">King

          <p>Monasticism‚Äôs popularity waned to some degree in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries
            with few new houses founded after the Black Death, though the existing houses did
            continue to dominate the county with their large estates. Late medieval popular piety
            tended to turn from supporting the monasteries to enlarging and decorating parish
            churches with funds raised by parishioners themselves, especially through church ales.
            This period also saw founding of many chantries and charitable institutions such as
            hospitals, almshouses, and schools.<note type="foot">Bettey, <title>Wessex from AD

          <p>The Reformation also developed slowly in Hampshire. Although Protestant influence was
            strong at Southampton, the rest of the county was held in check by power of the

            <p><rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/219955/" type="Person_Clergy">St Swithun</rs> was a bishop of Winchester who died in 862 and was buried in the
              churchyard of the Old Minster. <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/204950/" type="Person_Clergy">Bishop Aethelwold</rs> rebuilt the cathedral in 971 and had the saint‚Äôs body moved
              inside the church, where it was housed in a gold and silver shrine given by <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/220302/" type="Person_Royalty">King Edgar</rs> and placed behind the high altar. The Benedictine monks provided
              hospitality for many types of travellers: those coming to saint‚Äôs shrine and
              cathedral, those visiting Winchester because it was a royal city, and those taking the
              road to the port of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/72712/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Southampton</rs>. The number of visitors decreased from
              the thirteenth century on as the court visited less frequently and the road to
              Southampton took another route several miles east. Like other large Benedictine
              houses, St Swithun‚Äôs was intended to house seventy monks but rarely managed so many.
              In 1325 there were sixty-four but after the Black Death the numbers dropped, never
              again topping forty-six, and in 1495‚Äì6 they had dwindled to only twenty-nine. The
              priory possessed numerous manors across the county, though its holdings did not
              approach the huge estates of the bishops of Winchester. The <title>Valor

              the number to twenty-five, and the structures were enlarged at the same time. The
              endowment also provided for a master, a steward, four chaplains, and choristers. The

              approximate site of St Denys' rail station (which is now well within the bounds of the

              exception of St John‚Äôs, and the priory also acquired other churches and estates in the
              region. In 1535 the house had a prior and nine canons, but the numbers may have been
              greater in the fifteenth century, as the staff that served the canons was only five in
              1536 but had been eight in 1426. The <title>Valor Ecclesiasticus</title> put the

              the church and other buildings were in very poor repair.<note type="foot">J.B. Morgan,

          <p>Winchester and Southampton dominated both the county‚Äôs economy and its cultural life
            from before the Conquest to the seventeenth century. Moreover, both towns have
            well-preserved archives of civic records that do not exist to document life in the
            smaller towns and villages. For those reasons it is perhaps unsurprising that some
            relatively important medieval towns get very little mention in this collection, among
            them Basingstoke, Christchurch, Fordingbridge, Ringwood, and Romsey. Of these only
            Basingstoke lay on a major road likely to be used by itinerant performers, which may
            partially explain the lack of dramatic records, but the vagaries of manuscript survival
            are no doubt responsible for the fact that we know little about those towns yet a good
            deal about entertainment activity at Andover and even at rather obscure villages like

            <p>The earliest dramatic records from Winchester date from the fourteenth century, after
              the city‚Äôs glory years under King Alfred and the early Norman monarchs, but the late
              medieval and early modern city inherited much from its earlier history, in particular
              its physical layout. Winchester lies on the west bank of the River Itchen where an
              ancient east-west route crossed the river. The river valley is narrow at Winchester,
              the Hampshire chalk downs rising on either side. The eastern half of the city, from
              the Itchen to west of the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/107876/" type="Place_F_Church">cathedral</rs>, lies on relatively flat river bottom. The land then slopes up
              significantly to the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/155613/" type="Place_F_Residence">castle</rs> and West Gate. On the east bank of the Itchen
              the ground rises rapidly to the crest of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/111361/" type="Place_F_OpenArea">St Giles' Hill</rs>. The city walls define a roughly rectangular space
              approximately twice as wide east to west as north to south and the streets follow the
              characteristic Roman grid pattern. The High Street follows the line of the old
              east-west route, the other main streets crossing it at right angles.<note type="foot">Keene and Rumble, <title>Medieval Winchester</title>, vol 1, pt 1, pp 42, 48;

              <p>Iron Age hill forts have been excavated in the Winchester area, at St Catherine‚Äôs
                Hill and Worthy Down, and at Oram‚Äôs Arbour just west of the modern rail station. In
                the late first century CE the Romans made Winchester a regional garrison and
                constructed the walls that gave the medieval city its basic rectangular shape.<note type="foot">Keene and Rumble, <title>Medieval Winchester</title>, vol 1, pt 1, pp
                  42‚Äì3.</note> The walls survived to protect the royal and episcopal community of
                the Saxon period and in the 880s King Alfred substantially rebuilt the city as one
                of his 'burhs' that provided defenses against the Danes. The community of secular
                canons established at Old Minster in 643 was replaced by a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/107330/" type="Place_ReligiousHouse">priory</rs> of Benedictine monks dedicated to St
                Swithun and the minster enlarged. The Roman walls were refurbished and new streets
                laid out, with only the central High Street and the gateways remaining, while the
                rest was newly divided and almost nine kilometres of new road created, using eight
                thousand tons of cobbles. The royal palace was originally located in the centre of
                the city just west of Old Minster. Shortly after 900 New Minster was built just to
                the north of Old Minster and Nunnaminster (later St Mary‚Äôs Abbey) built for nuns to
                its east. In the second half of the tenth century building works added considerably
                to the physical extent of the monasteries and the shrine of St Swithun brought
                pilgrims to the city.<note type="foot"><title>VCH: Hampshire</title>, vol 2, pp

                demolished in the 1140s. The ten or eleven parish churches that had existed in

              <p>All this growth in wealth and population was short-lived, however. The relationship
                between Winchester and the monarchy weakened under Henry I, who ended the custom of
                Easter crown-wearing at Winchester. The civil war between <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/220477/" type="Person_Royalty">Stephen</rs> and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/220542/" type="Person_Royalty">Matilda</rs> further strained the relationship, especially
                after the siege of Winchester in 1141 that resulted in the burning of the royal
                palace. The royal treasury remained at Winchester for a few more decades but most
                royal administration left Winchester for London. <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/220613/" type="Person_Royalty">Richard I</rs> would return to Winchester to be re-crowned on his return from
                Crusades but the king had become less important in Winchester, while the bishop
                became dominant. Stephen‚Äôs brother, Bishop Henry of Blois, continued some of the
                building, founding <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/106916/" type="Place_F_Hospital">St Cross Hospital</rs> and serving as patron to the
                artistic explosion at Winchester in the second half of the twelfth century that
                included creation of the Winchester Bible. When the king was absent from Winchester
                the bishop took charge, so the ecclesiastical community continued to exert
                considerable influence over the secular part of the city, even after the entire
                southeastern quadrant of the city, enclosing the three minsters and the bishop‚Äôs
                palace, had been walled off as a religious precinct. Influential bishops like Henry
                of Blois and later Henry, Cardinal Beaufort, and Stephen Gardiner kept Winchester
                from entirely losing significance on the national stage.<note type="foot">Bettey,

              <p>Surveys taken by Henry I and Bishop Henry of Blois in the early twelfth century
                show the king to have been the largest landowner in Winchester at that time.
                Moreover, all land not occupied by buildings ‚Äì meaning especially all the streets in
                the city ‚Äì belonged to the king, so that even someone setting up a stall in the
                street was required to pay a fee to the king. In Saxon and early Norman times the
                king ruled the city through his reeves. The mayor and guild merchant appeared only
                at the beginning of the thirteenth century, once the Crown had withdrawn from
                Winchester. The charters Winchester received from Henry III in 1227 and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/30996/" type="Person_Royalty">Edward III</rs> a century later incrementally increased the city‚Äôs authority to
                govern itself. Yet even in the fourteenth century the city had not become
                independent of the king, as the mayor‚Äôs oath swears the mayor to keeping the city
                safe for the profit of the king and doing nothing to impair the king‚Äôs interests.
                Winchester thus had to develop its civic government through a series of efforts to
                satisfy the king‚Äôs interests through its own officers and organization rather than
                through officers imposed by the Crown.<note type="foot">J.S. Furley, <title>City

              <p>The later thirteenth century saw the emergence of the twenty-four and also of the
                commonalty or community (freemen of the city not members of the twenty-four), who
                participated in the election of the mayor and bailiffs. The twenty-four had an
                advisory function only, with no direct power to legislate or administrate, instead
                wielding influence by working closely with the mayor. Legislation was done at the
                Burghmote, which met at Michaelmas and Easter (and at least one other time) each
                year to elect the mayor and bailiffs and to enact other business, including (from
                the late thirteenth century) electing members of parliament. The Burghmote or

              <p>Derek Keene sums up Winchester‚Äôs experience in the later Middle Ages: 'In the
                eleventh and twelfth centuries Winchester was both a royal city and a major centre
                of wealth and population; by the sixteenth century it had declined to the minor
                regional centre and cathedral city which it has been ever since.'<note type="foot">Keene and Rumble, <title>Medieval Winchester</title>, vol 1, pt 1, p 86.</note>
                The records of entertainment that first appear in the 1370s thus reflect the
                diminution of the city‚Äôs wealth due to the Crown‚Äôs withdrawal (largely complete by
                1300) as well as the impact of the Black Death. The episcopal administration and
                monasteries that remained were relatively self-sufficient and so brought less wealth
                to the city‚Äôs merchants and tradesmen than had the visits of the royal court. Having
                ranked fourth among English towns at the time of the Conquest and still in the top
                ten in the twelfth century, Winchester had slipped to fifteenth by the time of the
                1334 assessment. Keene and Rumble put the population at 11,625 around 1300, but it
                had shrunk to 7,750, even including the suburbs, by 1400.<note type="foot">Keene and
                  Rumble, <title>Medieval Winchester</title>, vol 1, pt 1, pp 86‚Äì7, 90‚Äì2, 366‚Äì8.
                  Using the 1417 tarrage survey, Keene computes an approximate population for
                  Winchester (within the walls) at this time at 4,153, with another 2,768 living in
                  the Soke. He also estimates that 729 lived in the city‚Äôs ecclesiastical
                  institutions, including the cathedral, monasteries, and Winchester College.
                  Another sixty were permanent residents of the castle and Wolvesey
                Palace.</note></p>
              <p>Winchester became a major collecting point for the wool trade in southwestern
                England with wool being traded at St Giles‚Äô Fair and then exported through
                Southampton. St Giles‚Äô Fair, held in September, was established by a grant from King
                William Rufus. He set fair time as the three days surrounding the saint‚Äôs feast day
                on the first of September but the fair soon grew to six and then sixteen days or
                longer in the twelfth century. During the fair all trading was suspended within the
                city and the mayor led a great procession out the East Gate to St Giles‚Äô Hill, with
                the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/156198/" type="Collective_Office">civic minstrels</rs> carrying the 'tron of wools,' the
                scale used for weighing imports into the city (so that tariffs could be assessed).
                In the twelfth and early thirteenth century it was one of the two or three most
                important fairs in England, attended by merchants from London, York, Lincoln, and
                other prominent English towns, as well as traders from Spain, France, and the Low
                Countries. By the mid-thirteenth century the fair had hit its high point and its
                decline accelerated in the fourteenth century as Winchester lost its national
                importance in the clothing industry to London, though the city and its fair
                continued to be the principal cloth market in Hampshire.<note type="foot">Keene and

              <p>The city‚Äôs decline continued through the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, as
                computations based on the 1524‚Äì7 subsidy show the population had decreased to
                between three and five thousand while in wealth Winchester had fallen to
                thirty-eighth place in the country. It did remain the most populous town in
                Hampshire but Southampton had surged ahead in assessed wealth at ¬£101 to
                Winchester‚Äôs ¬£85.<note type="foot">Keene and Rumble, <title>Medieval
                    Winchester</title>, vol 1, pt 1, pp 92, 368.</note> The cathedral city had a
                very different economy and distribution of wealth from the port. Southampton had a
                few wealthy merchants and a large number of people who served the port‚Äôs trade as
                carters, labourers, and the like, and who were too poor to be taxed. Winchester, on
                the other hand, had a more diverse economy, with only a few citizens in the higher
                ranges of taxation but a large number of craftsmen whose goods and services made
                enough to be taxable, if at the lowest level. A similar difference in the
                distribution of wealth separated Winchester from other more prosperous towns
                elsewhere in England. At Exeter and Norwich, for example, three per cent of the
                population owned goods worth over ¬£100 in 1524, while no one did at Winchester, and
                only two per cent were assessed at more than ¬£40, while at Exeter it was seven per
                cent and at Norwich six per cent. At the other end of the economic scale, fully
                sixty per cent of Winchester‚Äôs population was assessed at ¬£4 or less, while only
                twenty-six per cent had so little at Exeter.<note type="foot">Keene and Rumble,

              <p>Winchester‚Äôs decline was further intensified in the early sixteenth century by

                from gaining possession of St John‚Äôs Hospital and its properties, the rents of which

              <p>A further blow came from the loss of much of the cloth-finishing industry that had
                sustained Winchester after the departure of the Crown. By 1581 only eleven of the
                100 most highly assessed taxpayers were involved in manufacturing or selling cloth
                (compared to sixteen gentlemen or professional men, fifteen victuallers, twelve
                general retailers, nine each in leather-working and metal working). In 1565 roughly
                22,000 kersey cloths were exported from Hampshire through London and Southampton; by
                1619 the number was under 7,000. Interest in kersey cloth had declined nationally
                and places like Devon and Norfolk successfully made the transition to serges and
                other new draperies. So did Southampton, which benefited from the arrival of
                Protestant Walloon refugees from the Netherlands in the 1560s who brought new
                techniques with them, but Hampshire in general and Winchester in particular did not
                make the shift rapidly enough. In the early seventeenth century Winchester was
                processing less than a third as much wool as Southampton was and in the 1630s the
                city‚Äôs cloth trade collapsed altogether.<note type="foot">Adrienne Rosen,

              <p>Like other towns Winchester experienced a great deal of immigration from the
                countryside in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. By 1600 natives
                of Winchester made up only a third of the population of the city and the Soke.
                Overcrowding was not a problem at first, since the decline in population since the
                early Norman heyday had left open spaces in the city and a series of plagues kept
                the overall population growth in check.<note type="foot">Adrienne Rosen, ‚ÄòWinchester

              <quote><p>On Thursday the 21st of August, I took Winchester in my way homewards, where
                  I saw an ancient city, like a body without a soul; and I know not the reason of
                  it, but for ought which I perceived, there were almost as many parishes as people.
                  I lodged at the sign of the Cock, being recommended to the host of the house by a
                  token from Salisbury; but mine host died the night before I came, and I being
                  weary had more mind to go to bed than to follow him so long a journey, to do my
                  message or deliver any commendations. But the whole city seemed almost as dead as
                  mine host, and it may be they were all at harvest work. But I am sure I walked
                  from one end of it to the other, and saw not thirty people of all sorts. So that I
                  think if a man should go to Winchester for a goose, he might lose his labour, for
                  a trader cannot live there by vending such commodities.<note type="foot">John

            <p>Southampton has always owed its importance to topography, its sheltered port on a
              tongue of land between the mouths of the Test and Itchen rivers, near the northern end
              of the bay or inlet known as Southampton Water. The <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/2363/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Isle of Wight</rs> guards the entrance to Southampton Water, further protecting the
              port from the winds and currents of the North Atlantic. Until the sixteenth century
              sailing through the English Channel and up the Thames presented greater risks than
              using Southampton‚Äôs port and then transporting goods overland to <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/36947/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">London</rs>. The Romans built their port settlement, Clausentum, at what is now <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/86878/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Bitterne</rs>, on the eastern side of the Itchen, starting arround 70 CE.<note type="foot">Barry Cunliffe, <title>Wessex to AD 1000</title>, A Regional History of

              and moved south a few hundred yards to become the core of the medieval town.<note type="foot">M.R. Maitland Muller, 'Southampton before the Norman Conquest,'

            <p>Southampton‚Äôs basic plan existed by the middle of the thirteenth century and would
              change little through the late medieval and early modern periods. The town had a
              basically rectangular shape, roughly 300 metres wide from west to east and 600 metres
              long from north to south, bounded on the west and south by the River Test where it
              becomes Southampton Water. Outside the walls to the north and east lay fields, with
              considerable suburbs just outside the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/155639/" type="Place_Feature">Bargate</rs> to the north and at the old site of Hamwic around St Mary‚Äôs Church to
              the east. The castle occupied much of the northwest quadrant of the town, defending
              the town from attack by sea. The West Gate and Quay lay to the south of the castle. At
              the southeast corner of the walls stood the tower of God‚Äôs House Hospital, just east
              of the Watergate. English Street (now High Street) formed the backbone of the town,
              running from the Bargate at its north end to the Watergate on the south, with the
              shops and residences of many of the prominent merchants arranged along it.<note type="foot">Platt, <title>Medieval Southampton</title>, pp 43‚Äì6.</note></p>
            <p>Despite Danish attacks in the tenth and early eleventh centuries, Southampton had few
              fortifications at the time of the Conquest. The castle was started in the twelfth
              century but it took war with France in the fourteenth century to motivate the town to
              complete the keep and fully surround itself with stone walls.<note type="foot">Platt,
                  <title>Medieval Southampton</title>, pp 9, 127‚Äì9, 141‚Äì2.</note> The Bargate, which
              defined the northern limit of the town and separated the densely built-up area from
              the suburbs, was first built around 1200 and considerably enlarged later.<note type="foot">Platt, <title>Medieval Southampton</title>, p 36.</note> Most eleventh-
              and twelfth-century buildings were constructed of timber, but in the thirteenth
              century prosperous burgesses began to build in stone imported from Normandy, the Isle
              of Wight, and Dorset ‚Äì only to have their impressive stone buildings destroyed in the
              French raid of 1338. Rebuilding came only after peace with France in the early
              fifteenth century. A new quay at the Watergate and the great warehouse known as the
              Wool House, just inside that gate, were projects of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/220996/" type="Person_Commoner">Thomas Middleton</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1140/" type="Collective_Office">mayor</rs> from 1401 to 1404. A new conduit and waterhouse
              were built around the same time and improvements were made to the city‚Äôs
                defences.<note type="foot">Platt, <title>Medieval Southampton</title>, pp 39‚Äì40,
                119‚Äì30, 142‚Äì6.</note> Most of the new tenements were once again made of timber, some
              thrown up hastily on top of surviving stone vaults, but others built in the fourteenth

                period Hamwic served as Wessex‚Äôs port for overseas trade and after the Conquest

                  Continent.<note type="foot">Barry Cunliffe, <title>Wessex to AD 1000</title>, A

                trade was especially successful from the thirteenth to the fifteenth centuries; in
                1287‚Äì8, for example, custom paid on the wool exported through Southampton came to
                nearly ¬£700, which at half a mark (6s 8d) per sack works out to almost 2,400 sacks,
                the wool from over half a million sheep.<note type="foot">Platt, <title>Medieval
                    Southampton</title>, pp 72‚Äì3, cites an account (TNA: E122/136/1) that gives the
                  total custom paid at Southampton that year as ¬£696 7s 7 3/4d, which meant the port
                  had shipped 2,389 sacks of wool. An estimated 250 shorn sheep per sack yields a
                  total number of sheep of 597,250.</note> When the trade in raw wool declined in
                the fourteenth century it was replaced by an increase in the trade in finished
                cloth. Exported wool and cloth were traded for imports from France, Italy, Spain,
                and Flanders ‚Äì particularly wine, dyestuffs, spices, and luxury goods, as well as
                building materials including lead, slate, and limestone.<note type="foot">Platt,

              <p>The demand for <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40997/" type="Thing_FoodDrink">wine</rs> came mainly from the royalty and aristocracy,
                making the wine trade particularly subject to the vicissitudes of war and foreign
                relations. The first Norman monarchs had gotten most of their wine from northern
                France but after the English kings lost Normandy and Anjou early in the thirteenth
                century, Southampton turned to southwestern France, specifically Bordeaux, as its
                main trading partner. The king levied a tariff in kind on wine, taking for himself
                one tun of wine from every shipload of ten to twenty tuns and two tuns for every
                shipload over twenty tuns. Much of the construction at the castle, just north of the
                West Quay, was therefore not defensive but rather to provide storehouses for the
                king‚Äôs wine, ready to be shipped to him at London, Winchester, or Clarendon, or
                distributed to religious houses in southern England as a gesture of royal
                  favour.<note type="foot">Platt, <title>Medieval Southampton</title>, pp
                  73‚Äì4.</note></p>
              <p>Italians tended to dominate the exporting of wool in the thirteenth century, as
                merchants from Lucca and Florence held royal licences to export wool alongside
                English exporters from Winchester, Salisbury, Newport, Andover, Newbury, and
                Bristol. Many of the foreign merchants actually took up residence in Southampton,
                often marrying into burgess families. Much of the town‚Äôs economy was thus based on
                serving outsiders, including resident foreigners, mariners, and traders who visited
                the port, and soldiers who gathered in war time to garrison the town‚Äôs defences or
                ship overseas.<note type="foot">Platt, <title>Medieval Southampton</title>, pp
                  69‚Äì70, 72.</note></p>

              <p>Southampton suffered recession in the fourteenth century due to war with France,
                exacerbated in mid-century by the Black Death. The French raiders who attacked in
                1338 not only started a fire that destroyed many buildings but also carried away
                much of the town‚Äôs stored wool and wine. Many traders, especially the foreign
                merchants, deserted the town, and plague, the weakened economy, and frequent attack
                warnings kept them away over the following half-century. The mustering of troops at
                Southampton in 1415 for the Agincourt campaign gave the port‚Äôs economy a jump-start
                and it continued to improve after peace with France in the 1420s following <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/176646/" type="Person_Royalty">Henry V</rs>‚Äôs successful French campaigns. The return of the Italian traders
                brought a return to prosperity that lasted until wars in Italy in the early
                sixteenth century greatly diminished the number of ships coming from Florence,
                Genoa, and Venice. The sixteenth century also brought improvements to navigation on
                the Thames and when London-based merchants stopped shipping through Southampton,
                London replaced Southampton as the dominant port for trade with the Continent.<note type="foot">Platt, <title>Medieval Southampton</title>, pp 109‚Äì30, 147‚Äì50, 152‚Äì4;

                connected Hampshire, Sussex, and Dorset with continental ports from the Low
                Countries to Spain. The town‚Äôs efforts to reverse this decline consisted mainly of
                trying to convince the national government to grant Southampton monopolies on
                specific commodities. The town succeeded in gaining protection for the sweet wine
                trade but such limited remedies could not arrest the general shift of commerce

              <p>Like most towns, Southampton suffered in the late sixteenth century from the
                combination of nationwide inflation and an increase in civic expenditure as the town
                government‚Äôs administrative responsibilities grew. Rising population, due to rural
                poor moving to the towns in search of employment and poor relief, led to social
                tension, especially during grain shortages: in 1608 people transporting grain out of

                increased two years later when Southampton was made a county in its own right,
                distinct from Hampshire (from what had been known as the ‚Äòcounty of Southampton‚Äô),
                thereby freeing the burgesses from interference by county officials.<note type="foot">Platt, <title>Medieval Southampton</title>, pp 165‚Äì7.</note> The civic
                leadership was somewhat unstable, because once a family had become wealthy through

              few miles south of the town. Andover‚Äôs importance came largely from its position on
              the main road from London through Salisbury to the west, an old Roman road that
              intersected at Andover with another old Roman road running from Winchester northwest

              manor, and borough of Andover are all three co-extensive. The manor was a royal vill
              at the Conquest and in 1175 Henry II granted the town a guild merchant. King John
              confirmed and enlarged the borough‚Äôs freedoms in a series of charters that were
              reaffirmed by succeeding monarchs until Elizabeth granted a new charter in 1599. The
              borough‚Äôs main officials were a bailiff, steward, two chamberlains, and the
              twenty-four aldermen, known as ‚Äòforwardmen‚Äô in Andover. The burgesses held the manor
              from the king, with the bailiff effectively acting as lord of the manor. At the time
              of the Elizabethan charter the guild merchant was replaced by three companies ‚Äì the
              Leathermen, Haberdashers, and Drapers. Cloth-making was Andover‚Äôs principal industry

            <p><rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/87185/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Portsmouth</rs> was founded in 1194 by Richard I as a
              port for royal ships and in 1256 gained the right to have a guild merchant, but the
              town‚Äôs growth was partially restrained by Southampton‚Äôs claim that Portsmouth lay
              within the port of Southampton, and the latter port made continuing efforts to hold
              onto its position as the major southern port and restrict Portsmouth‚Äôs
                development.<note type="foot"> Turner, <title>History of Hampshire</title>, pp
                45‚Äì6.</note> Portsmouth thus remained relatively small until the seventeenth
              century. The English forces sailed from Portsmouth to France before the victory at
              Crecy in 1346, but Portsmouth was not a walled city and the French burned it in 1338
              and successfully attacked again in 1359 and 1377‚Äì80. <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/23807/" type="Person_Royalty">Henry VII</rs> directed that a dry dock be built at Portsmouth in 1495, but the
              town suffered from a 1563 plague and fires in the port area in 1557 and 1576.
              Portsmouth‚Äôs population dropped to a mere thousand in the late sixteenth century and
              it contributed little to resistence to the Spanish Armada in 1588. The seventeenth
              century saw a reversal of this decline, as a royal charter from Queen Elizabeth in
              1600 gave Portsmouth corporate borough status clearly for the first time, although the
              charter also established that the town could not infringe on the power of the naval
              captain of the port.<note type="foot">Bettey, <title>Wessex from AD 1000</title>, pp

          <p><rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/106806/" type="Place_F_School">Winchester College</rs>, the oldest major public school in England, was founded in

              by Cowling from her ‚ÄòPerformance at Winchester College,' pp 101‚Äì115.</note> It was the
            first endowment of its kind, intended as a feeder school for his earlier foundation of
              <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/219573/" type="Place_F_School">New College</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/39267/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Oxford</rs>, in 1379. At the time it was probably the
            largest and best endowed school in Europe. Henry VI was later to copy this pattern of
            integrating school and college when he founded Eton College in 1443 as a feeder school
            for King‚Äôs College, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/73473/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Cambridge</rs>. The college buildings lie just south of the
            cathedral precinct at the southeast corner of the city.</p>
          <p>The original foundation of Winchester College consisted of the warden, ten fellows (who
            took on duties such as the sub-warden, the sacristan, and the bursar, in rotation), the
            headmaster, the usher (the only other master until 1650), three chaplains, three lay
            clerks, sixteen quiristers (choristers), and seventy scholars ('pauperes et
            indigentes'), whose education was free. There were to be no more than ten commoners,
            that is, those whose fathers paid for their education, but by the end of the sixteenth
            century the numbers of commoners had increased considerably and included day boys from
            Winchester after the demise of Winchester‚Äôs grammar school at the Reformation. Other
            boys who could claim direct descent from Wykeham, referred to as Founder‚Äôs Kin, swelled
            the intake, even though their conditions of entry were less stringent than those of the
            other scholars. Although there was often little substance in such claims of family ties
            to Wykeham and the process was much abused, the privilege was not abolished until the
            late nineteenth century. The provision for seventy scholars remains to the present
            day.</p>
          <p>Thanks to the prescience of the draftsman of the 1400 Founder‚Äôs Statutes and scrupulous
            adherence to the provisions in Rubric 41: <title>De Libris Conservandis et non
              Alienandis</title> ('books to be kept and not parted with'), the records of the
            college are well preserved and in the case of the bursars' accounts, almost
              complete.<note type="foot">Kirby, <title>Annals of Winchester College</title>, p
              517.</note> These records attest to the varied dramatic and paradramatic activities
            enjoyed by the scholars from the college‚Äôs founding in the late fourteenth century until
            the Interregnum. These activities included both the visits of professional <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1261/" type="Entertainer_Type">entertainers</rs> and the boys‚Äô own performances that ranged from the ceremony of the
              <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/21537/" type="Drama_Character">boy bishop</rs> to <rs ref="https://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215119/" type="Drama_Type">plays</rs> by <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/218515/" type="Person_Male">Plautus</rs> and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/218462/" type="Person_Male">Terence</rs>.</p>
          <p>Winchester also had a grammar school attached to the cathedral, but it disappeared at
            the Reformation and there are no surviving records that might tell of dramatic activity
            there. Basingstoke‚Äôs Holy Ghost School was first mentioned in 1548 and may have been
            founded as early as 1524, and Andover is known to have had a school from 1569.<note type="foot"><title>VCH: Hampshire</title>, vol 2, pp 368‚Äì71; <title>VCH:

              1626, and 1628, and was sheriff of Hampshire from 1637 to 1639. Oglander supported the

            <p>Oglander‚Äôs journal, commonplace book, and accounts provide a detailed picture of his
              own life and that around him on the Isle of Wight. His nineteenth-century editor, W.H.
              Long, likens Oglander to John Aubrey, remarking that Oglander 'was a lover of gossip,
              and recorded for the information and amusement of posterity any particulars that
              struck his fancy, whether trivial or important.' Still, Long says, ‚ÄòOf everything that
              came under his notice personally, his account is thoroughly reliable, and his details
              of contemporary matters and incidents maybe safely accepted as trustworthy.' His
              dating can be suspect, however, and 'his statements of events which occurred before
              his time will not always bear strict examination.'<note type="foot">W.H. Long,

                Wallop</rs> brought no substantial new estates, but did ally him with his
              father-in-law, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/140973/" type="Person_Gentry">Sir Henry Wallop</rs>, long a leader of the Protestant gentry
              in the county. By the time of his marriage Paulet had served as sheriff of Hampshire
              in 1583‚Äì4, as receiver for debts in Hampshire, Wiltshire, and Gloucestershire in 1585,
              and as high collector for his part of Hampshire for the 1586 lay subsidy. In 1590‚Äì1 he
              was sheriff again and attended on the queen when her progress came to his
              father-in-law‚Äôs estate at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/123775/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Farleigh Wallop</rs>. A year later he was knighted and
              made a justice of the peace, and he was heavily involved in the militia for the
              following decade.<note type="foot">Lindquist, 'Sir Richard Paulet,' p vii.</note></p>
            <p>A 1593 letter to <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/130613/" type="Person_Nobility">Lord Burghley</rs> seeking the office of captain of
              Portsmouth offers clear evidence of Paulet‚Äôs ambition. Since Burghley‚Äôs granddaughter
              had recently married the latest marquess of Winchester, Paulet obviously hoped to
              trade on family connections, but Burghley disappointed him.<note type="foot">Lindquist, 'Sir Richard Paulet,' pp vii‚Äìviii; HRO: 44M69 F2/11/59, F2/12/2.</note>
              However, this setback only temporarily slowed Paulet‚Äôs steady accretion of lands and
              offices that led eventually to parliament. Paulet‚Äôs estates and influence were located
              mainly in the northern half of the county, but he was also made a burgess of
              Southampton in 1600, when his cousin <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/130307/" type="Person_Gentry">Thomas Lambert</rs> was mayor of the town. Lambert‚Äôs and Paulet‚Äôs mothers were
              sisters, both daughters of Richard Andrews of Laverstoke. Lambert too was knighted and
              served as an MP, and the two men engaged in several business and land ventures
              together. In 1601 Paulet added extensively to the scope of his estates by purchasing
              the wardship of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/115534/" type="Person_Gentry">Thomas Jervoise</rs>, whose inheritance included lands in
              Wiltshire, Shropshire, and Nottinghamshire. Jervoise was soon married to Paulet‚Äôs
              eldest daughter, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/115611/" type="Person_Gentry">Lucy</rs>, and as Paulet had no son he adopted his new
              son-in-law as his heir. In 1604 Paulet was elected to James I‚Äôs first parliament as
              member for <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/124626/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Whitchurch</rs> and he served again in 1610, keeping a
              diary that provides many details of that parliament‚Äôs debate over the 'Great Contract'
              that Robert Cecil aimed to forge between parliament and the king. Paulet made his
              first and only speech in the House of Commons in the brief 'Addled' parliament of
              1614. Paulet died shortly thereafter and was buried in St Nicholas, Freefolk, where
              his monument dominates the small church.<note type="foot">Lindquist, 'Sir Richard

            <p>Paulet was a great reader. In December 1596 he wrote this memorandum:</p>

            <p>Religion was certainly a great interest of Paulet‚Äôs, though it is not clear which way
              Paulet leaned or indeed if he had a great commitment to a particular religious
              position. When preparing to take refuge on the Isle of Wight during an invasion scare
              in 1599, Paulet noted that he intended to take with him a Bible and ‚ÄòMr Egertons book
              of the principles of Religion‚Äô (‚ÄòA noat of what Armors I must carye with me to the
              Isle of Wight‚Äô).<note type="foot">HRO: 44M69 G5/20/58.</note> Egerton was a famous
              Puritan divine, and the book was possibly his translation of a popular French treatise

            <p>Thomas Jervoise was born 11 June 1587, only son of Thomas Jervoise of Britford,
              Wiltshire, but was orphaned at an early age after which he lived with his stepfather,
              George Wrottesley. In 1601 the fourteen-year-old Thomas‚Äô wardship was purchased by Sir
              Richard Paulet; Jervoise then married Paulet‚Äôs daughter Lucy and was made Paulet‚Äôs
              heir. Jervoise inherited the Herriard and Freefolk estates at Paulet‚Äôs death in 1614
              and continued to live in Hampshire, although he often visited the estates in
              Wiltshire, Worcestershire, and Shropshire inherited from his father, particularly
              Britford in Wiltshire and Chelmersh in Shropshire.</p>
            <p>Jervoise was knighted in 1607 and first elected to parliament in 1621 from
              Whitchurch, the seat that had been Paulet‚Äôs. During the 1624 session he kept a journal
              similar to Paulet‚Äôs if somewhat narrower in scope, as it deals only with proceedings
              in the Commons, and of those primarily the foreign policy debates. Jervoise held the
              Whitchurch seat through the Civil War, in which he staunchly supported the
              parliamentary side, including with some ¬£15,000 of his own money. He died on 20
              October 1654 and is buried at Herriard. Thomas‚Äô eldest son, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/116699/" type="Person_Gentry">Richard</rs>, also supported parliament as a captain of the Hampshire militia and
              was killed in battle in 1645. The next oldest son, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/118468/" type="Person_Gentry">Thomas</rs>, inherited the Jervoise estates and himself served in parliament in the
              1680s.</p>
            <p>The Jervoise family still own and live at Herriard Park, four and a half miles south
              of Basingstoke and set just to the east of the village church, St Mary‚Äôs. The current
              house was built in the late twentieth century, replacing a house of about 1700.
              Nothing is known of the earlier house used by Sir Richard Paulet and Sir Thomas
                Jervoise.<note type="foot">'Herriard Park,' <title>Historic England</title>,
                https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1000861</note> Paulet
              appears to have preferred Freefolk, his manor some fifteen miles west of Herriard on
              the River Test, a little over a mile east of Whitchurch, which both men served in
              parliament. St Nicholas', Freefolk, still contains an impressive monument to Paulet,
              who is buried there. Jervoise also spent more time at Freefolk in the years covered by
              the records in this collection but settled the manor on his son Richard, and when
              Richard died in 1643 the Freefolk estate passed to his wife‚Äôs family and was
              eventually sold. Nothing remains of the manor house of the seventeenth century.<note type="foot"><title>VCH: Hampshire</title>, vol 4, pp 282‚Äì5, <title>British History

              not regain a title until Elizabeth created him earl of Hertford in 1559. The following
              year he secretly married <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/144352/" type="Person_Nobility">Katherine Grey</rs>, who was required to notify the sovereign of any decision to
              marry because of her own strong blood claim to the throne. Both Katherine and Edward
              were imprisoned in the Tower until Katherine‚Äôs death in 1568, when Edward was released
              and allowed to appear at court. In 1582 he again made a clandestine marriage to <rs ref="eats:241937" type="Person_Nobility">Frances Howard</rs> that only became
              publically known a decade later. In 1591 he attempted to gain favour with the queen by
              entertaining her with elaborate pageantry at Elvetham, but in 1595 he angered her
              again by petitioning to have his marriage to Katherine Grey proclaimed valid and his
              sons legitimate. He was again committed to the Tower, but only for two months, and in
              1602 he was appointed lord lieutenant of Somerset and Wiltshire. Under King James he
              served as ambassador to Brussels and continued as lord lieutenant. He was buried in
              the Seymour Chapel of Salisbury Cathedral.</p>
            <p>Hertford‚Äôs principal residence was Tottenham Lodge, at Great Bedwyn, Wiltshire, which
              Hertford had built in preference to nearby Wulfhall, which he had inherited from his
              father. He also held the manor of Elvetham, Hampshire, which had been in the Seymour
              family since the mid-fifteenth century.<note type="foot"><title>VCH:

              declared illegitimate because the queen had invalidated his parents‚Äô clandestine

              named Elizabeth‚Äôs successor, but neither Elizabeth nor James would agree. He was
              usually addressed as 'Lord Beauchamp,' his father‚Äôs lesser title, though he had no

              was educated at St Paul‚Äôs School and then Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where he was a
              student of Stephen Gardiner. He began to serve Thomas Cromwell in 1524 and in 1530
              became joint clerk of the signet to Gardiner, who had become the <rs ref="https://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/43591/" type="Person_Royalty">king</rs>‚Äôs secretary. Cromwell and the king employed Wriothesley in a variety of
              matters, many of them concerning the king‚Äôs divorce from <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/138362/" type="Person_Royalty">Katherine of Aragon</rs>. He was also given the job of destroying St Swithun‚Äôs

              relics. In 1539 Thomas Wriothesley was elected to parliament as a knight of the shire
              for Hampshire. Wriothesley managed to survive Cromwell‚Äôs fall and became increasingly
              important in national affairs, eventually being named lord chancellor in 1544 and, by
              King Henry‚Äôs will, earl of Southampton in 1547. He was generally associated with the
              religious conservatives who moderated the advance of the Reformation as long as Henry
              VIII was alive, but after Henry‚Äôs death he came into conflict with Somerset, the Lord
              Protector, who feared Wriothesley might lead a Catholic coup in favour of Princess <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/43849/" type="Person_Royalty">Mary</rs>. He was placed under house arrest at his London residence, Lincoln House
              in Holborn, became ill and died 30 July 1550.</p>

            <p>At the Dissolution the king had recognized Wriothesley‚Äôs service by granting him
              Titchfield Abbey and Beaulieu Abbey, as well as Quarr Abbey on the Isle of Wight.
              Wriothesley converted the former Titchfield Abbey buildings into a grand residence,
              called Place House. The impressive gatehouse with four octagonal turrets still stands,

          <p>The earliest known dramatic activity in Hampshire took place in the monasteries. The
              <title>Regularis Concordia</title>, rules for life in Benedictine houses throughout
            England adopted at the council of Winchester between 965 and 975, contains the
                <title><rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215148/" type="Drama_TitledWork">Visitatio Sepulchri</rs></title>, including the <title>Quem
              quaeritis</title> trope, a sung dialogue that was part of the liturgy for matins on
            Easter morning and is traditionally considered to mark the beginning of medieval drama
            in Britain. Although there are no records of specific performances of the
              <title>Visitatio</title> in Hampshire, the <title>Regularis Concordia</title> is
            thought to be largely the work of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/204950/" type="Person_Clergy">√Üthelwold, bishop of Winchester</rs> from 963 to 984, and the
              <title>Visitatio</title> text is also found in the <title><rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/70686/" type="Thing_BookPlayMusic">Winchester Troper</rs></title>, a collection of music created at Winchester. The
              <title>Visitatio Sepulchri</title> was thus almost certainly performed annually from
            the late tenth century up until the Dissolution by the monks of St Swithun‚Äôs Priory, and
            probably at Hyde Abbey, Winchester‚Äôs other Benedictine house.<note type="foot">Frere,

          <p>Another practice that brought dramatic elements into the liturgy was the festival of
            the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/21537/" type="Drama_Character">boy bishop</rs> ‚Äì choosing one of the cathedral choir boys to play the role of the
            bishop on the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/41365/" type="CalendarDay_Liturgical">feast of the Holy Innocents</rs> (28 December). The
            obedientiary accounts of St Swithun‚Äôs Priory record gifts of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40997/" type="Thing_FoodDrink">wine</rs> to the boy bishop on Innocents‚Äô Day from 1326-7 right up to the year of the

              and <ptr target="#hamps-ridp240040448"/>.</note> The St Swithun‚Äôs accounts
            consistently use the term 'episcopus iuuenum' ('bishop of the youths') rather than
            'episcopus puerorum' ('bishop of the boys'), the phrasing used in the Winchester College
            records (see <ptr target="#hamps-ridp243520480"/>, for example). It is unlikely, though,
            that the St Swithun‚Äôs phrasing means that its participants were older than usual;
            elsewhere the ceremony is known by several names, including 'episcopus innocentium' and
            'episcopus elemosinarie.'<note type="foot">Salisbury Cathedral called its boy bishop
              'episcopus choristarum.' The many records of boy bishops at Durham Priory refer to the
              'episcopus elemosinarie,' 'episcopus puerili,' and even 'episcopus puerili
              elemosinarie' (see ‚ÄòCounty Durham‚Äô, <title>Records of Early English Drama
                North-East</title>, http://community.dur.ac.uk/reed.ne/?page_id=10). Chambers
              mentions the St Swithun‚Äôs accounts of the boy bishop but gives more space to boy
              bishops at Hyde Abbey and St Mary‚Äôs convent that were probably inventions of Thomas
              Warton (<title>Medieval Stage</title>, vol 1, p 361; see the appendix on Warton‚Äôs
              records. See also James Michael John Fletcher, <title>The Boy Bishop at Salisbury and

          <p>St Swithun‚Äôs also employed outside <rs ref="eats:1261" type="Entertainer_Type">performers</rs>, mainly <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1243/" type="Entertainer_Type">musicians</rs>, to augment the ceremonies on important feast

            Performers</ref>). Other Hampshire monastic houses probably enjoyed visiting performers
            too but no relevant records have survived from houses like the abbeys at Hyde,
            Mottisfont, and Beaulieu, or the Benedictine convents of Nunnaminster (Winchester),
            Romsey, and Wherewell.</p>
          <p>Several stories about early dramatic and musical activity in Winchester first appeared
            in <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/219405/" type="Person_Commoner">Thomas Warton</rs>‚Äôs 1774 <title>History of English Poetry</title> and have been
            repeated in Chambers‚Äô <title>Medieval Stage</title> and other histories of English
            drama. The records of the boy bishop at Winchester College that Warton included come
            from extant manuscripts and are thus included with the main records of <title>REED
              Online</title>‚Äôs Hampshire collection. However, the manuscripts in which Warton claims
            to have found several of his most interesting stories have not survived ‚Äì or never
            existed ‚Äì and there is reason to think that the stories may be Warton‚Äôs inventions.
            These stories thus appear here in an appendix with an explanation of why they are
            problematic (see <ref target="https://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/collections/hamps/appendix-4/">Appendix

            most of the evidence we have of drama at the local, parish level, although like most
            English counties Hampshire possesses surviving churchwardens‚Äô accounts earlier than 1642
            from only a small fraction of its parishes. Among that small fraction some accounts lack
            details, giving only total receipts and expenses, and others survive only from 1600 or
            later and thus are very unlikely to contain relevant records. If we restrict our
            analysis to parishes with pre-1600 accounts we find that six of the eight such parishes
            yield relevant records.<note type="foot">Hutton‚Äôs list of churchwardens‚Äô accounts shows
              that Hampshire is about average in its number of parishes for pre-1600 churchwardens‚Äô
              accounts. Hutton lists thirty-one for Devon, but only six for Gloucestershire, three
              for Bedfordshire, and one for Herefordshire (<title>Rise and Fall</title>, pp
              263‚Äì93).</note> The implication is that dramatic activity was quite widespread in the
            county before the Reformation took hold. Most of the evidence of drama comes from
            parishes in the northern half of the county, north of Winchester, with only <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/86966/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Fordingbridge</rs> and Southampton <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/162331/" type="Place_F_Church">St
              Lawrence's</rs> the exceptions, but we cannot infer much from that pattern as only one
            other parish in the southern half, Ellingham, has extant accounts, most of them summary.
            (These figures do not include the Isle of Wight, which is quite literally a place apart
            when discussing local dramatic activity.)</p>

            one: though many counties held ales involving a king or lord figure, the event was
            called a ‚Äòking ale‚Äô most frequently in Hampshire and the surrounding counties. In
            addition to Reading, Sherborne (Dorset) called its festivity a ‚Äòking ale,' as did
            Steyning (Sussex), but the phrase does not turn up in records from Kent, Devon, or
              Somerset.<note type="foot">Rosalind Conklin Hays et al (eds), <title>Dorset /

              Exeter.</note> The king ale records from other parishes come mostly from the sixteenth

            those in his diocese who clung to such traditional popish practices, complaining that it
            ‚Äòis a straunge perswasion among Christians, that they can not by any other meane of
            contribution repaire their Churches, and set forth the service of God, but that they

            ales were among the most resistant to change: Wootton St Lawrence saw its incumbent
            removed, Stoke Charity was one of the last churches to obey the 1559 directive to remove
            side altars, and Bramley did not exchange its Catholic chalice for a Protestant

          <p>Certainly Cooper was right that many parishes relied on king ales as their main source
            of income. Wootton St Lawrence‚Äôs churchwardens spent the considerable sum of ¬£7 13s 10d
            on their king ale in 1600, including 23s 10d for minstrels and 8s 6d for the lords‚Äô and
            ladies‚Äô ‚ÄòLyueries,' but they collected enough money from the participants that the event
            made a profit of ¬£3 17s 1 1/2d, roughly four times as much as the 19s 4d the parish
            received in income from all other sources. Ronald Hutton notes that ‚Äòas church ales
            became rarer, they also tended to be more spectacular when they were held‚Äô and Wootton
            St Lawrence‚Äôs is his primary example.<note type="foot"><title>The Stations of the Sun: A

              that ‚Äòafter 1605 it ceased to hold any‚Äô king ales.</note> Many parishes had no other
            means of meeting their expenses, especially for poor relief and repairs to the church
            fabric, until they began to impose rates on all the parishioners, typically in the
            second or third decades of the seventeenth century.</p>
          <p>The Isle of Wight had its own form of May game, described both in Newport‚Äôs 'Ligger

            was happening when the parish churchwardens of Crondall rewarded a minstrel for playing

          <p>The <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/41461/" type="CalendarDay_Liturgical">Christmas season</rs> also occasioned festive customs,
            though Hampshire offers less evidence for that time of year. A 1563 coroner‚Äôs report
            tells us that one <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/114553/" type="Person_Commoner">John Hypper</rs> of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/87032/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Houghton</rs> died after being struck in the testicles while ‚Äò<quote source="#hamps-ridp222162128">playnge <ex>Christ</ex>enmas games</quote>‚Äô in his

              these records of lords of misrule is definitely datable to the Christmas season, and
              it is possible that they were connected to summer games instead.</note> Paulet was
            also visited by <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/134052/" type="Entertainer_Type">wassailers</rs> from villages near his houses at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/87010/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Herriard</rs> and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/106707/" type="Place_F_Residence">Freefolk</rs> at Christmas time.</p>
          <p><rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40815/" type="Entertainment_Custom">Hocking</rs> was another custom common in the county.
            Records of money collected at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/72132/" type="CalendarDay_Liturgical">Hocktide</rs> come from rural parishes like Herriard and
            South Warnborough and from urban ones like St Lawrence‚Äôs Southampton and St John‚Äôs
            Winchester. Most of the records date to the middle of the sixteenth century, but at
            South Warnborough and Alton as late as the 1620s. Hocktide festivities were held on the
            Monday and Tuesday of the week following <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/41327/" type="CalendarDay_Liturgical">Easter week</rs>. The most common form of the festivity
            involved groups of men or women taking ‚Äòprisoner‚Äô individuals of the opposite sex and
            forcing them to pay a fine to be released. Regional variations appear to have been
            common, however, as Sir Francis Taverner describes the festivity in his parish of
            Hexton, Hertfordshire, as involving a contest between the men and women of the parish to
            pull a pole from the top of a hill to the bottom. The women were always the victors and
            in fact the women usually end up dominating the men at Hocktide and gathering the
            largest sum for the parish. The funds thus gathered were given to the parish especially
            for poor relief but also to pay for repairs to the church fabric and other parish
            expenses. The Bramley accounts for 1561‚Äì2 are notable in specifying that the hocking
            money was used to purchase two table cloths and a ‚Äòtreue vessell.'<note type="foot"> See
                <ptr target="#hamps-ridp220873504"/>. Taverner says that at Hexton part of the money
              gathered was 'then given to the poore, the remaining money the Hockers delivered unto
              the Churchwardins, who layd out the same in reparation of the church, and Bells and
              the like‚Äô (BL: Add. MS 6223, f 12v). If Taverner is correct, then in some years all
              the gatherings from hocking may have been given to the poor directly so that no amount
              from hocking shows up in the churchwardens‚Äô accounts. See also Sally-Beth MacLean,

            Isle of Wight in writing regretfully in the 1630s or 40s of practices that have
            disappeared. Taverner sums up his description of Hexton‚Äôs hocking: ‚ÄòI think these nicer
            tymes of ours, would not only despise these sports, but also account them ymmodest, if
            not prophane, But those playne and well meaning people did Solace them selves in this

          <head>Civic Entertainment: Musicians</head>
          <p>Homegrown dramatic activity in Hampshire appears to have been sponsored almost
            exclusively by parishes; the towns instead relied on the performances of itinerant
            troupes. The towns did however employ musicians for a range of entertainment and
            ceremonial functions. Southampton‚Äôs records provide a great deal of detail about the
            town's musicians and their relations with the civic government. The first mention of the
              <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/154950/" type="Collective_Office">town musicians, or waits</rs>, in Southampton‚Äôs own records
            comes in the steward‚Äôs accounts for 1433‚Äì4, but the town had employed musicians at least
            forty years earlier, as Winchester‚Äôs chamberlains gave 18d to three ‚Äò<rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/13000/" type="Collective_Office">ministrall<ex>is</ex> de Hampton</rs>‚Äô in 1394‚Äì5 and Salisbury rewarded

              Greenfield, 'Using Dramatic Records,' p 81, suggests that the musicians Southampton
              took on in 1433‚Äì4 were its first town musicians; the 1394‚Äì5 record from Winchester has
              since come to light. The 1398‚Äì9 record from Salisbury comes from a transcription of
              the mayor‚Äôs account by Audrey Douglas, forthcoming in REED's <title>Wiltshire
                including Salisbury</title> collection, edited by C.E. McGee, Rosalind Hays, and
              Audrey Douglas: ‚ÄòIt<ex>e</ex>m iij ministrall<ex>is</ex> Ville

              G/23/1/1, f 13 (rendered 26 September 1399)).</note> The group mentioned in 1433‚Äì4 may
            have been adopted by Southampton in that very year. The 1428‚Äì9 accounts do not mention
            any musicians of the town so the group of the 1390s must have died or moved on. In
            1433‚Äì4, though, a rough set of steward‚Äôs accounts includes among expenses for a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40561/" type="Entertainment_Type">feast</rs> in the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/155639/" type="Place_Feature">guildhall</rs> on 13 January a reward of 20d the mayor gave to

              Suth<ex>amptonie</ex>.' In addition, the steward claimed expenses for going to
            Winchester on 11 May to go bail for three minstrels named <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/135334/" type="Person_Commoner">Richard March</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/135853/" type="Person_Commoner">John Goddislond</rs>, and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/135590/" type="Person_Commoner">William Goldfynch</rs>. The mayor of Winchester, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/135655/" type="Person_Commoner">Walter Hore</rs>, had requested that the minstrels be arrested and both they and the
            steward were questioned by justices at the assizes. A year later Southampton‚Äôs minstrels
            received both wages and new <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/43439/" type="Thing_LiveryRegalia">liveries</rs> and the wages were paid to Richard ‚ÄòWayte,' John ‚ÄòWayte,‚Äô and William
              ‚ÄòWayte.'<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp225421648"/>.</note> It appears
            that this group of three musicians played for the mayor and council at the feast in
            January and were then adopted as the civic waits by Southampton. The fact that they were
            'de‚Äô Winchester before they were ‚Äòapud‚Äô Southampton may only mean they came ‚Äòfrom‚Äô
            Winchester, but their arrest by the mayor of Winchester shortly afterward suggests they
            were ‚Äòof‚Äô Winchester; that is, they had previously been employed as <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/156198/" type="Collective_Office">Winchester‚Äôs waits</rs> and that city was not ready to part with them. Southampton
            went to considerable expense to employ these musicians, paying for liveries as well as
            wages and protecting them at the assizes, but after a four-year gap in the accounts
            there is no trace of them in the town‚Äôs records for 1438‚Äì9.</p>
          <p>Town musicians then appear infrequently in Southampton‚Äôs records until the early
            seventeenth century. In 1493 the town paid for liveries for three waits, probably the
            same ‚Äòministral' ville Southampton<ex>ie</ex>‚Äô who played at St Denys' Priory, just
            north of the town, on the saint‚Äôs feast day in that year.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp226266080"/> and <ptr target="#hamps-ridp224376608"/>.</note>
            Almost a century later there appears to have been only a single musician, as ‚Äò<quote source="#hamps-ridp227692928"><rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/142061/" type="Person_Commoner">henrie the Minstrell</rs></quote>‚Äô was paid ¬£4 in 1579 for ‚Äòhis ffredome of the
            keping of the waightes‚Äô and he received his livery for several years. In 1587 the town
            gave him a poor boy as an <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/55239/" type="Collective_Occupation">apprentice</rs>.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp227988960"/>.</note> By 1594 there were multiple musicians, as
            the town gave liveries to ‚Äò<quote source="#hamps-ridp227923648">weightes</quote>.'</p>
          <p>In 1607 Southampton increased the size of the town consort, providing liveries for five
            musicians and also having two ‚Äò<rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/42646/" type="Thing_LiveryRegalia">Scuttchins</rs>‚Äô of silver made for the waits to wear, ‚Äò<quote source="#hamps-ridp228684272">impressed w<ex>i</ex>th the Townes Armes; Namelye, three

            on the town musicians appear frequently in the records, up to and through the
            Interregnum. In the 1620s and 1630s, when the town sent players away without allowing
            them to perform, it regularly gave the musicians new liveries and in 1629 gave them
            three more silver scutcheons so that all five musicians had such badges.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp228872048"/>.</note> The musicians kept the
            ‚Äòbenevolences‚Äô and other payments they received for performing in a box, from which one
            of their number stole in 1633.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp239390272"/>.</note> The town also placed poor children with them as apprentices and did what it
            could to help the musicians make a living beyond the official wages it paid, licensing
            them to keep <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/21077/" type="Collective_Occupation">alehouses</rs> and engage in ‚Äòhuckstering‚Äô ‚Äì buying up
            wares at the market before it opened and reselling them at higher prices.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp228759040"/>.</note> All these records give
            the musicians‚Äô names, allowing us to keep track of the make-up of the consort.</p>
          <p>At Winchester unidentified minstrels had been rewarded for playing at the annual
            dinners of the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/154325/" type="Collective_GuildReligious">fraternity</rs> of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/111737/" type="Place_F_Hospital">St
              John</rs> as early as 1389‚Äì90,<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp245757152"/>.</note> but the first definite evidence that the city employed musicians appears in
            the 1397‚Äì8 chamberlains‚Äô accounts, which include payments for <rs ref="eats:302518" type="Thing_ClothingMaterials">cloth</rs> for liveries for ‚Äò<quote source="#hamps-ridp245360592">ministrall<ex>is</ex> Ciuitat<ex>is</ex></quote>.' The
            same year they were paid for getting the ‚ÄòTron,' the city‚Äôs weighing machine that was
            taken up <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/111361/" type="Place_F_OpenArea">St Giles‚Äô Hill</rs> each year at the time of the annual <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/43457/" type="Entertainment_Type">fair</rs>. The city again paid for cloth for its minstrels in 1406‚Äì7, but we only
            know that they continued for another sixty years from the occasional rewards to
            entertainers of the city in the records of Winchester College, where they first appear
            in 1398‚Äì9.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp245417136"/> and <ptr target="#hamps-ridp241445440"/>.</note> The college bursars refer to them variously
            as ‚Äòministralli,' ‚Äòmimi,' ‚Äòlusores,' and in the 1470‚Äì1 bursars‚Äô accounts, as ‚Äò<quote source="#hamps-ridp242432624">le Waytys Ciuitat<ex>is</ex> Winton<ex>ie</ex></quote>.'
            It seems probable that the minstrels who performed at the annual dinners of Winchester‚Äôs
            fraternity of St John were the city‚Äôs own musicians but the fraternity‚Äôs accounts never
            provide a specific identification. From 1470‚Äì1 to the early seventeenth century no
            entertainers identified as the city‚Äôs own appear in any of the extant records. Then in
            1611‚Äì12 Winchester College rewarded ‚Äò<quote source="#hamps-ridp244223904">musicis de
                Civit<ex>ate</ex> Winton<ex>ie</ex></quote>,' and similar payments occur in the
            college accounts every year or two right up to 1642. These musicians first appear in the
            city‚Äôs own coffer accounts in 1614 and they appear frequently in the records thereafter,
            including in 1638 when they received new coats. Their leader in 1620 was <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/199358/" type="Person_Commoner">James Beale</rs>, later replaced by someone named <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/202970/" type="Person_Commoner">Combes</rs> by 1633.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp248290256"/>, <ptr target="#hamps-ridp248491552"/>, <ptr target="#hamps-ridp248298976"/>, and <ptr target="#hamps-ridp248432256"/>.</note></p>
          <p>The other Hampshire town with many records of musicians is <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/86811/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Andover</rs>, which has the earliest record of an entertainer in Hampshire. The
            Domesday Book states that ‚Äò<rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/221943/" type="Person_Commoner">Adelina</rs> joculatrix‚Äô held one virgate of land in Upper Clatford in Andover

              (Chichester, 1982), section 1, 25).</note> The record is an especially intriguing one
            since it refers to a female performer. (Another of the rare examples of female
            performers is the ‚Äò<quote source="#hamps-ridp223849344"><rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/195926/" type="Person_Commoner">minstrell mayde</rs></quote>' who visited <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/113645/" type="Person_Gentry">Sir

            household. Munby‚Äôs edition translates ‚Äòjoculatrix‚Äô as ‚ÄòJester‚Äô but the Latin word can
            mean ‚Äòjuggler‚Äô and perhaps just <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1261/" type="Entertainer_Type">entertainer</rs> in a generic sense ‚Äì thus not distinguishing between juggler,

          <p>Most of the evidence of musicians living at Andover comes from wills and inventories of

          <p>The earliest form of dramatic activity performed by the scholars themselves appears to

          <p>The Reformation brought an end to the boy bishop, but the greatest period of dramatic
            activity at Winchester College began in 1561 with the arrival of a new schoolmaster, Dr
              <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/218259/" type="Person_Commoner">Christopher Johnson</rs>. The details of Johnson‚Äôs influence emerge from his dictated
            lessons, as written down by a scholar named <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/219137/" type="Person_Commoner">William Badger</rs> between 1563 and 1567. These <ref target="https://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/collections/hamps/appendix-1/">‚ÄòDictates‚Äô</ref> are contained in a small booklet titled <title>Themes at Winchester
              School</title> (BL: Add. Ms 4379). Of the 422 dictates in Badger‚Äôs notebook, eight
            have particular significance for drama historians and give us a clear picture of how
            often and under what conditions <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215119/" type="Drama_Type">plays</rs> were acted by the scholars. The plays were mostly in Latin and staged
            twice a year, at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/41461/" type="CalendarDay_Liturgical">Christmastime</rs> and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/200104/" type="CalendarDay_Liturgical">Shrovetide</rs>.</p>
          <p>In a dictate concerning plays (‚Äòspectacula‚Äô) at Christmas 1563‚Äì4 Johnson refers to
            characters who appear in <title><rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/218325/" type="Drama_TitledWork">Acolastus</rs></title>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40362/" type="Drama_Type">a prodigal
              son play</rs> by Dutchman <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/218044/" type="Person_Commoner">William Fullonius</rs>, written in Latin in 1529 (f 20v). During Shrovetide in 1564
            the boys acted in a Greek play which ‚Äì according to the wording of the dictate ‚Äì was a
            rare occurrence (f 27v). The following Christmas (1564‚Äì5) the bursars‚Äô accounts, under
            ‚ÄòExpenses for buildings and repairs,' record a sum of 11s 6d paid out for expenses
            regarding the plays in the Christmas holidays.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp243815712"/>.</note> In the corresponding dictate, Johnson
            comments favourably on the boys‚Äô acting styles but his good temper seems not to have
            lasted, for in the dictate referring to the second of the plays performed at this time
            he comments somewhat irascibly on the nature of comedies and the difficulties of staging
            them: ‚ÄòQuid enim aliud est com<ex>o</ex>edia quam negotiosum nihil?‚Äô ('For what else is
            comedy than a laborious nothing?') (f 89).</p>
          <p>A manuscript tragedy called <title><rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215175/" type="Drama_TitledWork">Pelopidarum Secunda</rs></title> has an epilogue indicating it was performed at
            Winchester College, probably for the annual Founder‚Äôs Day celebration.<note type="foot">See <ref target="https://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/collections/hamps/appendix-3/">Appendix 3</ref>; the editors are grateful to Martin Wiggins for calling their
              attention to this play. It is number 840 in his <title>British Drama</title>, vol 3,
              pp 1‚Äì4. Wiggins dates the play to 1590, linking it to the mention of a 'teatro' in the
              bursar‚Äôs accounts for that year, but there are several other such records in the
              accounts and Johnson‚Äôs dictates mention plays in years when no stage or theatre was
              constructed, so any such date must remain conjectural.</note> The play, which is
            written in English despite the Latin title, tells the well-known story of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215369/" type="Drama_Character">Agamemnon</rs>‚Äôs death and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215523/" type="Drama_Character">Orestes</rs>‚Äô revenge on <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215281/" type="Drama_Character">Clytemnestra</rs> and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215347/" type="Drama_Character">Aegisthus</rs>.

          <p>A number of Hampshire aristocrats are known to have had connections to the drama but
            few have left records of performances at their residences in the county. Perhaps the
            best known is <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/83830/" type="Person_Nobility">Henry Wriothesley</rs>, fourth earl of Southampton, dedicatee
            of at least two of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/199852/" type="Person_Commoner">Shakespeare</rs>‚Äôs poems (<title>The Rape of Lucrece</title>
            and <title>Venus and Adonis</title>). Unfortunately no records of Southampton‚Äôs
            household have survived to tell us whether Shakespeare‚Äôs company ‚Äì or any other players,
            for that matter ‚Äì visited the earl at his Hampshire residences at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/107506/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Titchfield</rs> or <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/107568/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Beaulieu</rs>. Both manors were monastic houses given to
            Henry Wriothesley‚Äôs grandfather, Sir <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/121946/" type="Person_Nobility">Thomas Wriothesley</rs>, by Henry VIII at the Dissolution. In fact the only evidence
            of dramatic activity by the Wriothesley household in Hampshire comes from the very first
            year of Sir Thomas‚Äô residence at Titchfield, when <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/140094/" type="Person_Nobility">Lady

          <p>The <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/221085/" type="Person_Family">Paulet family</rs> of Basingstoke came to prominence when <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/172771/" type="Person_Nobility">William Paulet</rs> became lord treasurer under Henry VIII and retained that position
            through the reigns of Edward, Mary, and Elizabeth, until his death in 1572. Though no
            doubt he attended numerous court entertainments, the marquess of Winchester left no
            relevant household records nor have the other Paulets of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/123360/" type="Place_F_Residence">Basing House</rs>. Sir Richard Paulet of Herriard and Freefolk has, however, provided
            us with a rich cache of records of dramatic and musical entertainment that he enjoyed at
            his Hampshire residences, in London, and at the households of others. Sir Richard, a
            grandson of the lord treasurer‚Äôs younger brother, became sheriff of the county and MP
            for Whitchurch from 1604 until his death in 1614. Paulet welcomed a variety of
            entertainers to his household, including <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/127860/" type="Entertainer_Type">maskers</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/134052/" type="Entertainer_Type">wassailers</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1243/" type="Entertainer_Type">musicians</rs>, a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/14146/" type="Drama_Character">lord of misrule</rs>, and even on <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/41680/" type="CalenderDay_Secular">New Year‚Äôs Day</rs> 1613 a ‚Äò<quote source="#hamps-ridp223849344">minstrell
              mayde</quote>.' He also gave rewards to musicians on visits to other Hampshire gentry,
            while acting as a justice of the peace at both Winchester and Salisbury, and at
            Southampton when he was made a burgess. A diary that Paulet wrote in London for the
            parliament of 1610 mentions a number of court entertainments ‚Äì a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40677/" type="Entertainment_Type">tilt</rs>, a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40416/" type="Drama_Type">masque</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/18451/" type="Entertainer_Type">dancing</rs>, and a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40453/" type="Drama_Type">play</rs> ‚Äì which Paulet himself does not appear to have attended.

            printed description of the creation of Prince Henry as Prince of Wales, which included
            the text of the masque, <title>Tethys Festival</title>, by Samuel Daniel. He also bought

              Thomas Jervoise</rs>, seems to have preferred a narrower range of entertainment: he
            continued only the rewards to musicians, mainly when he was away from home.</p>
          <p>We also know a fair amount about household entertainments on the Isle of Wight in the
            late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, thanks to the detailed notebooks of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/98105/" type="Person_Gentry">Sir
              John Oglander</rs>. We do have to distinguish carefully between Oglander‚Äôs accounts of
            events at which he himself was present and the stories he relates of entertainments that
            actually occurred before he was born. The former include a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/214969/" type="Entertainer_Type">puppet play</rs> his family saw at Newport in 1630 and a gathering of the Isle‚Äôs

            the other hand, Oglander‚Äôs story of elaborate pageantry that went comically wrong is
            almost certainly hearsay. The story claims to describe the celebration of the
            appointment of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/116753/" type="Person_Nobility">Sir George Carey</rs>, long the captain of the Isle of Wight,
            to be lord chamberlain of the queen‚Äôs household in 1596, when Oglander himself was only

          <head>Travelling Performers</head>
          <p>Hampshire is particularly rich in records of the visits of travelling entertainers,
            partly due to the county‚Äôs relative proximity to London and the well-travelled road
            between London and the port of Southampton, but also due to the fortunate survival of
            manuscript records. Winchester, Winchester College, and Southampton all have financial
            accounting records that stretch back as far as the mid-fourteenth century and visiting
            minstrels appear in many of the earliest. The first recorded payment to travelling
            performers by the city of Winchester was made in 1377‚Äì8, by Winchester College in
            1410‚Äì11, and by Southampton in 1428‚Äì9.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp245298176"/>, <ptr target="#hamps-ridp241575872"/>, and <ptr target="#hamps-ridp225012208"/>.</note> Each place paid at least one travelling
            troupe in most years from the early fifteenth century until the early seventeenth. Even
            earlier records come from monastic institutions. The two surviving receiver‚Äôs accounts
            of St Swithun‚Äôs Priory record payments to unidentified minstrels in 1334‚Äì5 and
              1337.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp240125136"/> and <ptr target="#hamps-ridp240145920"/>.</note> Southwick Priory rewarded the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/32482/" type="Collective_Troupe">minstrels of King Richard II</rs> and those of the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/90390/" type="Collective_Title">earls of Kent</rs> and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/24172/" type="Collective_Title">Arundel</rs> between 1391 and 1394.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp225450400"/>, <ptr target="#hamps-ridp225223136"/>, and <ptr target="#hamps-ridp224925424"/>.</note>

          <p>The terms used in the records make it difficult to know exactly what sort of
            performances occurred in most cases. Occasionally a performer will be identified
            specifically as a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1162/" type="Entertainer_Type">piper</rs>, a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/26727/" type="Entertainer_Type">tumbler</rs>, or a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/21804/" type="Entertainer_Type">bearward</rs> (or their Latin equivalents), but before the
            Reformation most of the performers were called <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/8709/" type="Entertainer_Type">minstrels</rs>. Southampton‚Äôs accounts, in English from 1440, use ‚Äòminstrels‚Äô and the
            chamberlains of Winchester and bursars of Winchester College ‚Äòministralli,‚Äô while the
            college hall books use ‚Äòmimi‚Äô for what appear to be the same performers. Occasionally,
            one of the college bursars uses both ‚Äòministralli‚Äô and ‚Äòmimi‚Äô for different troupes in
            the same year, giving the impression he is differentiating between kinds of performers
            (see <ptr target="#hamps-ridp242350688"/>, for example), but he may just be using the
            terms interchangeably, like the 1459‚Äì60 bursar‚Äôs accounts that identify the earl of
            Arundel‚Äôs performers as ‚Äò<quote source="#hamps-ridp242214432">mimis
                s<ex>i</ex>u<ex>e</ex> ministrall<ex>is</ex></quote>.' Only at the end of the
            fifteenth century and beginning of the sixteenth do more definite distinctions appear to
            be made between minstrels and musicians on the one hand and actors on the other. The
            latter are called ‚Äòstage players‚Äô or simply ‚Äòplayers‚Äô in English, while the Latin
            accounts seem to be searching for the right term for this new phenomenon, trying
            ‚Äòinterludentes‚Äô and ‚Äòlusores‚Äô as well as the classical ‚Äòhistriones.‚Äô</p>
          <p>Players became the dominant type of travelling performer in the second half of the
            sixteenth century, only to decline in numbers in the seventeenth, all but disappearing
            by the late 1630s. Most of the itinerant entertainers are identified in the records by
            their royal and aristocratic patrons. As in most parts of the country, the royal
            minstrels and players showed up the most often; performers of every monarch from <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/32403/" type="Person_Royalty">Richard II</rs> to <rs ref="https://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/24537/" type="Person_Royalty">Charles I</rs> came to Hampshire. The performers of the
            successive <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/24172/" type="Collective_Title">earls of Arundel</rs> came nearly as frequently, in fact
            outnumbering visits by royal performers to Winchester College and Southampton from the
            mid-fifteenth century through the first quarter of the sixteenth. The earls owned lands
            in Hampshire and held many offices there, including justice of the peace for Southampton
            and warden of the New Forest. The <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/125079/" type="Collective_Troupe">minstrels of Henry, Cardinal Beaufort</rs>, were rewarded frequently during his
            tenure as <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/154663/" type="Collective_Office">bishop of Winchester</rs> (1404‚Äì47) ‚Äì four times by
            Winchester, five by Southampton, and seventeen times by Winchester College.</p>
          <p>One puzzling early record may represent a visiting performer enlisting some locals to
            perform with him. A dispute in Winchester city court in 1409 concerned four men who
            claimed they had been recruited to play a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/158317/" type="Drama_Character">steward</rs>, a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/158358/" type="Drama_Character">torturer</rs>, and two <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/128431/" type="Drama_Character">knights</rs> in a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40380/" type="Drama_Type">play</rs> of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/158693/" type="Drama_TitledWork">St
              Agnes</rs> (‚Äò<quote source="#hamps-ridp245582192">ludo vocat<ex>o</ex> pleye of synt
              agnes</quote>‚Äô) by a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/158073/" type="Person_Commoner">Richard Syngere</rs>. Syngere had promised to provide the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/42274/" type="Thing_TheatricalCostume">costumes</rs> and props and the four expected to profit
            from taking part in the performance. When Syngere failed to keep his side of the
            bargain, the four broke into his lodgings and stole the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/70656/" type="Thing_BookPlayMusic">text of the play</rs> and a <rs ref="eats:159180" type="Thing_SetMachinery">playing
              cloth</rs> ‚Äì perhaps a backdrop or ground cloth (‚Äòvnu<ex>m</ex> originale
              s<ex>an</ex>c<ex>t</ex>e Agnet<ex>is</ex> &amp; vnu<ex>m</ex> pannu<ex>m</ex>
              vocat<ex>um</ex> pleyngclo√æ‚Äô). The court records do not tell how the case was decided
            and much about it is unclear, but several points stand out. The four men all appear
            elsewhere in the Winchester records but Syngere does not, so he may have been a visitor
            to the town. The play was to be performed on 16 July, not at all connected to St Agnes‚Äô
            feast day, 21 January, but likely timed to catch the crowds who visited Winchester for
            the feast of the cathedral‚Äôs patron saint, St Swithun, a day earlier on the fifteenth.
            Moreover, the list of roles to be played by the four men do not include several of the
            most important characters in the story of St Agnes. So Syngere may have been a visiting
            player who came to Winchester to make some money at St Swithun‚Äôs Day, perhaps
            accompanied by other players who would have taken the more important roles, recruiting
            locals for the minor parts.<note type="foot">For a fuller discussion of this play, see

          <p>Of particular interest in the Southampton records are four licences to playing
            companies that were copied into the town‚Äôs ‚ÄòBooks of Instruments.' In 1591 two licences
            were copied ‚Äì one for <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/175683/" type="Collective_Troupe">Lord Beauchamp‚Äôs players</rs> and the other for <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/180666/" type="Person_Commoner">John</rs> and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/180596/" type="Person_Commoner">Laurence Dutton</rs>, who were <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/17169/" type="Collective_Troupe">players of the queen</rs> leading a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/213222/" type="Collective_Troupe">group of boys</rs>.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp228186944"/>.</note>
            The motive for copying these licences is uncertain, as players had been required to
            carry such licences ‚Äì or risk arrest as vagabonds ‚Äì at least since the <title>Acte for
              the punishement of Vacabondes and for Relief of the Poore &amp; Impotent</title> was
            issued in 1572. The licences were granted by <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/131827/" type="Person_Gentry">Edmund
              Tilney</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/61914/" type="Collective_Office">master of the revels</rs>, rather than by the players‚Äô own
            patrons and Tilney asserted that many troupes of actors were touring the country
            pretending to have noble patrons to the great detriment of the country. That may have
            been the usual rhetoric of such documents, but if there was indeed an epidemic of
            players on the road without licences, the authorities at Southampton might have wished
            to record Tilney‚Äôs language that gave them authority to refuse permission to play to any
            company that could not show such a licence.</p>
          <p>The licence from the privy council to <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/153197/" type="Collective_Troupe">Lord Strange‚Äôs men</rs> in 1593 has long been known to scholars and its interest to
            the town was no doubt in its reference to the plague at London that prevented Strange‚Äôs
            company from playing within seven miles of the capital.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp228261600"/>.</note> An additional motive for copying licences
            and this one in particular would be so the mayor could prove he was obligated to allow
            these actors to perform, in case anything went wrong (such as plague breaking out in
            Southampton) and the mayor‚Äôs judgment was challenged. The 1606 licence to <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/17474/" type="Collective_Troupe">Queen Anne‚Äôs players</rs> may have been copied because the mayor doubted its
            legitimacy ‚Äì as have modern scholars.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp228556560"/>.</note> Of the three actors named, only <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/187340/" type="Person_Commoner">Robert Lee</rs> was named in the patent that created Queen Anne‚Äôs company in 1603,
            and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/24813/" type="Person_Commoner">Martin Slater</rs> was a rather doubtful character who was caught travelling with a
            fake or duplicate licence in 1616. (In 1616 Martin Slater appeared before the mayor of
            Norwich with a licence for Queen Anne‚Äôs players that named ‚Äì among others ‚Äì <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/222656/" type="Person_Commoner">Thomas Greene</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/23345/" type="Person_Commoner">Thomas Swynnerton</rs>, and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/222762/" type="Person_Commoner">Christopher Beeston</rs>, but not Slater. The Norwich authorities noted that they had
            already seen this licence (or its twin) in the hands of Swynnerton and since Slater was
            not named, they denied him permission to play in the city. <note type="foot">David

          <p>A major attraction of these licences is that they name the principal actors in each of
            the companies. None of the actors in Lord Beauchamp‚Äôs company achieved prominence, but
            the Dutton brothers were active in important companies for several decades and Lord
            Strange‚Äôs troupe brought together some of the best-known actors of the time. <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/153045/" type="Person_Commoner">Edward Alleyn</rs> had been and would shortly again become the star of the lord

          <p>Beauchamp‚Äôs players did have a Hampshire connection, as their patron was <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/130875/" type="Person_Nobility">Edward Seymour</rs>, son of the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/144234/" type="Person_Nobility">Edward Seymour</rs> who was <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/30047/" type="Collective_Title">earl

            players had their licence copied at Southampton.<note type="foot"> See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp224398640"/>.</note> Beauchamp‚Äôs principal residence was at
            Tottenham Hall in Wiltshire, but if we were to consider him a Hampshire man, he would
            have the most frequently attested performers of any Hampshire patron. Lord Beauchamp‚Äôs
            players are recorded at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/73838/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Norwich</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/37840/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">York</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/123250/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Gloucester</rs>, and the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/2039/" type="Place_County">Kent</rs>

            patrons whose principal residence was in Hampshire appear to have been relatively rare
            despite the prominence of some county nobility in the nation‚Äôs affairs in the late
            sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/223131/" type="Collective_Troupe">Minstrels of Thomas Wriothesley</rs>, the second earl of Southampton, turn up in the

          <p>Bearwards visited Hampshire, though less often than minstrels or players. The earliest
            record of a bearward was a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/159852/" type="Collective_Troupe">bearward of George, duke of Clarence</rs>, who appeared in Southampton in
              1469‚Äì70<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp225891376"/>.</note> and multiple
            times at Winchester and Winchester College in the early 1470s ‚Äì as did the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/178769/" type="Collective_Troupe">earl of Warwick‚Äôs bearward.</rs> Visits to Winchester were rare in the sixteenth
            century but Southampton saw bearwards every year or two, with the royal bearwards the
            most frequent visitors: <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/166270/" type="Collective_Troupe">Henry VIII‚Äôs bearward</rs> came to Southampton almost
            annually from 1512 to 1530 and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/12915/" type="Collective_Troupe">Queen Elizabeth‚Äôs</rs> came four times in the 1580s. The <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/167529/" type="Collective_Troupe">bearward of Charles Brandon, duke of Suffolk</rs>, entertained the town five times in
            the 1520s. The latest record of a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/175656/" type="Collective_Troupe">bearward was one whose patron was Lord Chandos</rs>, who visited Southampton in

          <p>A much earlier but perhaps related kind of entertainment is suggested by an entry in
            the Winchester pipe roll for 1265‚Äì6: ‚Äò<quote source="#hamps-ridp220289616">Et xii .d.

            was being taken to a countess, or perhaps ferried to her, since the payment is in the
            accounts for the manor of Bitterne, on the River Itchen just east of Southampton, and
            the countess was probably <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/85068/" type="Person_Nobility">Isabella de Fortibus</rs>, dowager countess of Devon and

            herself ‚ÄòLady of the Isle of Wight.' Bearwards with performing bears are not known to
            have appeared as itinerant performers this early, but the bear might have been <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40835/" type="Entertainment_AnimalSport">displayed</rs> as a rarity, like the polar bear that

          <p>We can guess that itinerant performers also visited the houses of Hampshire
            aristocrats, although the surviving evidence is skimpy. Performing in a household,
            especially of a major noble like one of the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/83892/" type="Collective_Title">earls of Southampton</rs> at Titchfield, or the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/118434/" type="Collective_Title">marquess of Winchester</rs> at Basing, or the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/174597/" type="Collective_Title">Lords Sandys of The Vyne</rs>, was usually a better deal than performing in a town
            like Winchester or Southampton. Not only did nobles often give larger rewards than
            towns, but the players would have been fed and lodged in the household, greatly reducing
            their expenses. People have often assumed that Shakespeare and his fellow players in the
              <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/223085/ http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/127834/" type="Collective_Troupe">lord chamberlain‚Äôs men</rs>, later the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/17717/" type="Collective_Troupe">king‚Äôs men</rs>, would have travelled to Titchfield to perform for Shakespeare‚Äôs
            patron, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/83830/" type="Person_Nobility">Henry Wriothesley</rs>, fourth earl of Southampton, but no
            records of Wriothesley‚Äôs household have survived to support the assumption.</p>
          <p>The one household for which we do have extensive records is that of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/113645/" type="Person_Gentry">Sir
              Richard Paulet</rs> (cousin of the marquess of Winchester) and his adopted son, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/115534/" type="Person_Gentry">Sir
              Thomas Jervoise</rs>, at Freefolk and Herriard. Both Paulet and later Jervoise tended
            to reward entertainers more often when they themselves were travelling rather than when
            they were at home, for reasons that may have been mainly monetary. Neither man was
            lavish with rewards. The 5s Paulet gave to <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/131100/" type="Collective_Troupe">Lord Beauchamp‚Äôs musicians</rs> in 1609 was much the largest payment either gave to
            visiting entertainers; many received less than a shilling.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp223669376"/>.</note> Detouring four miles to Herriard from the
            main road at Basingstoke may not have seemed worth the trouble. Freefolk, on the other
            hand, was the residence both men seem to have preferred, and it lay just off the road
            that led from London through Basingstoke, Whitchurch, and Andover to Salisbury and
            further west ‚Äì making it a logical stop for <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/134520/" type="Collective_Troupe">Sir Thomas Thynne‚Äôs musicians</rs> on their way from Longleat House to London in
              1615.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp222471696"/>.</note> The most
            intriguing record of performers visiting Paulet and Jervoise is the earliest, a poem
            sent to Paulet in 1586 by six men with French names who offer to visit Paulet, labelled
            (perhaps by Paulet himself) ‚ÄòThe Maskers l<ex>et</ex>tre.'<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp223495616"/>.</note> Paulet gave rewards to visiting musicians
            several times between 1586 and his death in 1614. He attended <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40453/" type="Drama_Type">plays</rs>
            in London and bought <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/70656/" type="Thing_BookPlayMusic">play books</rs> but the extant records yield no evidence of
            players visiting Paulet in Hampshire. Jervoise received Sir Thomas Thynne‚Äôs musicians at
            Freefolk in 1615 shortly after he inherited the estate, but after that he rewarded
            entertainers only when serving as a justice at Salisbury or when visiting his estates in
            Shropshire.</p>
          <p>Entertainers travelling through Hampshire used a few likely routes. An obvious one led
            from London southwest to Winchester, then south to Southampton before turning either
            east or west. Records of southeastern ports like Dover and Rye link up well with
            Southampton‚Äôs to show that many travellers followed a loop out from London to
            Southampton and then turned east along the south coastal road that led to Chichester,
            Arundel, Rye, and the Kent ports.<note type="foot">Stenton, <title>'Road
              System'</title>, pp 7‚Äì11; Greenfield, 'Touring,' pp 301‚Äì2.</note> Some travelled
            further west, to Salisbury, Poole, Dorchester, Lyme, Exeter, Plymouth, and Barnstaple
            before bending northwards toward Bristol, Coventry, and in rare cases as far north as
              Carlisle.<note type="foot">See REED, <title>Patrons and Performances</title>,

            January, but must have travelled elsewhere before they reached Southampton six months
            later on 16 July. Not every travelling troupe visited both towns and the college on the
            same trip. Southampton rewarded many more entertainers than either of the Winchester
            venues, no doubt due to the port‚Äôs better access. After 1400 the main road linking
            London to Southampton passed a few miles east of Winchester and the cathedral city‚Äôs
            declining financial fortunes must have meant that travellers did not anticipate making
            enough in the city to balance the extra effort to get there.</p>
          <p>Hampshire‚Äôs receptiveness to visiting performers in the fifteenth and sixteenth
            centuries had waned by the early years of the seventeenth. Winchester College‚Äôs records
            show that plays performed by the scholars themselves became more popular than those of
            itinerant actors, who were last rewarded in 1570‚Äì1.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp243874064"/>.</note> Southampton still gave occasional rewards to
            travelling companies at the beginning of the seventeenth century, though the number had
            decreased to only one or two a year. Then a prohibition against allowing ‚Äò<quote source="#hamps-ridp229158000">Stage players to acte their enterludes</quote>‚Äô in the
            town hall was issued in 1620 (reiterated in 1624) and the only payments to visitors
            recorded during the 1620s and 1630s were to leave town without playing. Even royalist
            Winchester rewarded no players after 1623‚Äì4 and a 1617 Star Chamber case over players
            performing in a church on a Sunday afternoon reveals the growing tension between
            traditionalists and zealous reformers in the civic leadership.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#hamps-ridp244572080"/> and <ptr target="#hamps-ridp248262848"/>.</note> On
            the Isle of Wight visiting entertainers were welcomed somewhat longer, despite Sir John
            Oglander‚Äôs complaints about the disappearance of traditional seasonal festivities. The
              <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/25345/" type="Collective_Troupe">prince‚Äôs players</rs> were allowed to play in Newport in 1624 and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/214969/" type="Entertainer_Type">puppet players</rs> in 1630, though the latter had been turned away in 1628 due to

            musical activity took place in the county but we are fortunate that two playing places
            still exist in much the form they had in the late medieval and early modern period: the

          <p>In Southampton‚Äôs records the town hall or guildhall is identified as the hall over the
            Bargate, where the town council met, and it still stands today in the middle of the High
              Street.<note type="foot">See, for example, SCA: SC5/1/6, and also <title>VCH:
                Hampshire</title>, vol 2, p 497</note>. The Bargate is a sturdy stone structure that
            originally spanned the main entrance through the town walls from the north. John Leland
            described the Bargate around 1540 as ‚Äòlarge and well embatelid. In the upper parte of
            this gate is domus civica [town-hall]: and undernethe is the toun prison.‚Äô<note type="foot">Douch, <title>Visitors‚Äô Descriptions</title>, p 6.</note> The hall on the
            upper floor of the Bargate is 51 feet long (east to west) and 50 feet wide (north to
            south) at its widest point, but narrowing to 32 feet at either end. The entrance to the
            hall is at the east end, roughly in the middle of the east wall. The light comes mainly
            from four windows in the south wall.<note type="foot">P.A, Faulkner, ‚ÄòThe Surviving
              Medieval Buildings,' <title>Excavations in Medieval Southampton 1953‚Äì1969</title>,
              Colin Platt and Richard Coleman-Smith (eds) (Leicester, 1975), 59, fig 8.</note> In
            1620 the court leet ordered that the hall be cleaned and its tables and benches
            repaired, the damage having been ‚Äò<quote source="#hamps-ridp229158000">Cheifelie

              bothe by daie and nighte</quote>.' That the town hall was the site of public
            performances and not just performances exclusively for the mayor and council is
            confirmed by an order in the assembly book, which holds that allowing players to ‚Äò<quote source="#hamps-ridp228845712">Act and repr<ex>e</ex>sent theire Interludes playes and

            comfortably conducting the business of the daily piepowder court.</p>
          <p>Players may also have performed in some of the inns in the town. The 1620 court leet
            order provides that ‚Äò<quote source="#hamps-ridp229158000">yf anie suche stage Or <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/214969/" type="Entertainer_Type">poppett plaiers</rs> must be admitted in this towne That they p<ex>ro</ex>vide

            in the town hall. The only record placing players at an inn dates from almost a century
            earlier, however. In 1539 the steward paid 6s 8d ‚Äò<quote source="#hamps-ridp226638448">to the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/69534/" type="Collective_Troupe">kynges pleyers</rs> at the dolffyne which pleyd

              Rood Church</rs> in the High Street, where a more recent structure with the same name
            stands today. However, since the record indicates that the king‚Äôs players ‚Äòpleyd nott,'
            they may only have been staying at the Dolphin and not performing there.</p>
          <p>The city of Winchester had several halls and it is not clear from the records which one
            was being used in many cases. The great hall of Winchester Castle was reserved for the
            use of royalty and their visitors and never used for civic functions. Those instead took
            place in the hall of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/111737/" type="Place_F_Hospital">St John‚Äôs Hospital</rs>. <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/8709/" type="Entertainer_Type">Minstrels</rs> performed there on <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/41497/" type="CalendarDay_Liturgical">Corpus Christi</rs> and the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/41188/" type="CalendarDay_Liturgical">Nativity of St John the Baptist</rs> for <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40561/" type="Entertainment_Type">feasts</rs> held by the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/154325/" type="Collective_GuildReligious">fraternity of St John</rs>, an organization made up
            of the city‚Äôs ruling elite. The burghmote, Winchester‚Äôs assembly of freemen, met three
            times a year in the hall of St John‚Äôs, rather than in the smaller guildhall, and in the
            fifteenth century the city‚Äôs deeds and other records were kept in a chest there. Some
            the medieval buildings of St John‚Äôs Hospital survive, on the north side of the High
            Street, just inside the East Gate. The main building held two infirmaries on the ground
            floor with the hall on the floor above; at the east end were two chapels, only one of
            which remains.<note type="foot">Keene and Rumble, <title>Medieval Winchester</title>,
              vol 2, pts 2‚Äì3, pp 819‚Äì20.</note></p>
          <p>The mayor and bailiffs met in several different spaces before 1361, when city
            administration moved to a building on the south side of the High Street where Calpe
            Street (now St Thomas Street) runs into the High Street, with Calpe Street on its west
            side and the White Hart Inn the major tenement on the east. The ground floor along the
            High Street comprised six shops, with a tavern in the cellar below. In 1361 the mayor
            paid ¬£16 6s 8d for work to convert the upper floor into the new ‚Äòhall of pleas‚Äô ('nova
            aula plasitorum'). The hall was later also known as the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/111704/" type="Place_F_GuildHall">common hall</rs> ('aula communis') and in the fifteenth century as 'le Motehall,' 'le
            Tounehall,‚Äô and the guildhall. The new hall offered a larger space for performances than
            earlier guildhalls but since the building as a whole was no more than 55 feet in length,
            the guildhall remained smaller than the hall of St John‚Äôs Hospital.<note type="foot">Keene and Rumble, <title>Medieval Winchester</title>, vol 1, pt 1, pp 82‚Äì3; vol 2,
              pts 2‚Äì3, pp 603‚Äì4.</note></p>
          <p>At <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/106806/" type="Place_F_School">Winchester College</rs> performances took place in the college hall that still stands
            today. The building was part of the earliest construction at the college, with the
            instructional space (‚ÄòSchool‚Äô) on the ground floor and the hall on the upper floor, with
            dimensions of 63 feet by 30 feet.<note type="foot">Kirby, <title>Annals of Winchester
                College</title>, p 42.</note> The many performances by visiting minstrels probably
            occurred with the hall set as usual for meals, but in the late sixteenth century the
            bursars spent considerable funds for the construction of what they termed 'theatrum' and
            'scena' for the plays acted by the scholars. In 1589‚Äì90 the bursars paid for <rs ref="eats:302471" type="Thing_ClothingMaterials">wood</rs> and 1,200 <rs ref="eats:302489" type="Thing_ClothingMaterials">nails</rs> and for two carpenters to
            construct a theatre ('<quote source="#hamps-ridp244017520">p<ex>ro</ex>
            theatro</quote>'). In 1573‚Äì4 '<quote source="#hamps-ridp243891888">scaffolda<ex>m</ex></quote>' were built for three nights of comedies and tragedies,
            which may refer to a <rs ref="eats:302248" type="Thing_SetMachinery">stage</rs> or
            scenery or to bleacher-style seating for the audience. Given Winchester College‚Äôs
            connection with New College, Oxford, the stages and seating for performances at
            Winchester may have resembled those constructed at Oxford and Cambridge in the sixteenth
            and early seventeenth centuries.<note type="foot">See, for example, John R. Elliot et al

              Enham but now as Enham Alamein, Alamein having been added at the end of World War II.
              Since all the places are called 'villas propinquiores,' 'H'don' must be <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/127047/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Hatherden</rs>, also to the north of Andover. The

              civilians' (<title>OED</title>). Woolgar suggests that 'Pl<ex>egius</ex>

              which would be the expected phrase, especially as the pledges follow after (C.M.
              Woolgar, email message to editor, 10 October 2013). Only the 'r' of r<ex>espondet</ex>
              in the final line is visible at the right margin, as the edge of the leaf is darkened

              himself, but the town accounts include no other rewards or gifts to Lisle. The phrase

            <p>On sig Cii, Bale remarks that the priest‚Äôs behavior reminds him of ‚Äòwylle Somer.‚Äô
              Will Somer (d. 1559) was perhaps the most famous court fool of the period. He served
              Henry VIII and Edward VI and his fame lasted into the seventeenth century, as Robert
              Armin described Somer and his tricks in his study of ‚Äònatural‚Äô fools, <title>Foole
                upon Foole</title> (1600). Somer appears as a character in Thomas Nashe‚Äôs 1592
                <title>Summer‚Äôs Last will and Testament</title> and Samuel Rowley‚Äôs 1605 <title>When
                You See Me, You Know Me</title>, and may well have inspired Shakespeare‚Äôs
              Touchstone, Feste, and Lear‚Äôs Fool (‚ÄòSomer [Sommers], William (d. 1559),‚Äô J.R.

            <p>The play named on sig Ciii is Bale‚Äôs own, usually known as <title>Three Laws</title>,
              an intensely anti-Catholic morality play of 1538. As the description in this work
              indicates, the play accuses the pope and his followers of a wide range of vices, and
              exhorts Christians to turn instead to the guidance of the three sets of laws: of
              nature, of Moses, and of Christ. See <title>Three Laws</title> in Peter Happ√© (ed),

            <p> The dating of the accounts on pp 15‚Äì16 is a bit confusing, as 22 Henry VIII did not
              begin until 22 April 1530, whereas Palm Sunday fell on 10 April in 1530, so that Palm
              Sunday 22 Henry VIII was actually in 1531. The date 1530 is obviously the error, for
              the payments which follow these receipts are dated Palm Sunday 22 Henry VIII to Palm
              Sunday 23 Henry VIII. Furthermore, the set of accounts which follow these on p 17 are
              identified as being for 22‚Äì23 Henry VIII and are in fact another set of accounts for
              the same year as those on pp 15‚Äì16. The <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/3576/" type="Collective_ClergyAndChurchwardens">churchwardens</rs> are the same, as are all
              the amounts which occur in both accounts, such as those for <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/41327/" type="CalendarDay_Liturgical">paschal</rs> money, for
              <!--<rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/90177/" type="Person_Commoner">-->Edmond<!--</rs>-->'s
              rent, and for the amount of the profits from the church <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40561/" type="Entertainment_Type">ale</rs>. In fact it appears that the account begun on p 15 may originally have
              begun as the regular account for the year, but instead became an account detailing the
              receipts and expenses of the church ale, while the final account for the year is that
              given on p 17, which lists only the profits of the ale without details, as do most of
              the other years' accounts in this book. </p>

              rendered 1613 and 1614 (and written at the time of one of them, probably the former)
              states that all who were at the accounting, including the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/9186/" type="Collective_ClergyAndChurchwardens">vicar</rs>, the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/3576/" type="Collective_ClergyAndChurchwardens">churchwardens</rs>, and several others,

Then, on 29
              October 1615, another memorandum records that the vicar and churchwardens called a
              meeting of the entire congregation with the purpose of instituting a church rate
              assessed on land, at a halfpenny an acre for arable and pasture land (pp 140‚Äì1). With
              the exception of the single entry in 1625‚Äì6, the records never again mention gains at
              Whitsun. </p>

              served with one who had had a year's experience.) Neither Sone nor Wolbrig/Wolveridge
              is named as a churchwarden in the following set of accounts, so the years for which
              accounts are missing must have come after this set of accounts, and not before it.

              <ab>Indented inquiry taken at Houghton in the county of Hampshire on 29 December in
                the sixth year of the reign of the lady Elizabeth, by the grace of God, queen of
                England, France, and Ireland, defender of the faith, etc, before Gilbert Mather,
                coroner of the said lady queen in the aforesaid county, over the sight of the body
                of John Hypper, lying dead, formerly sometime husbandman of the aforesaid Houghton
                in the aforesaid county, by the oath of John Stert, Robert Snowe, Thomas Mylles,
                William Williams, Robert Austen, Richard Burkley, William Karcas, Richard Barfoote,
                Michael Symmons, Thomas Purdew, John Goddard, John Barfoote, John Evans, and John
                Colson, jurors, who say on their oath that on 26 December in the aforesaid year (of
                the reign) of the said lady queen around the hour of six after midday of the same
                day, it so happened that the aforesaid John Hypper, with various other parishioners
                of the aforesaid Houghton, was playing certain games called 'Christmas games' in the
                house of one Thomas Purdew of the aforesaid Houghton, husbandman, and that the
                aforesaid John Hypper, while playing and sporting, by misfortune and against his
                will, squeezed himself and injured his testicle against his will, so that, by that
                occurrence and by reason of an old sickness suffered previously in his body, with
                great pain he was immediately ill, and thus became weak and grew more ill, from the
                said 26 December of the aforesaid year to twenty-eighth day of the same month of
                December thereafter next following. And on the same 28 December of the aforesaid
                year at the aforesaid Houghton in the aforesaid county in his own house, the
                aforesaid (Hypper) died from that occurrence and illness around the third hour
                before midday of the same day. And so the jurors say on their oath that the
                aforesaid John Hypper came to his death in the aforesaid way and manner and not
                otherwise. In witness of this, I the aforesaid coroner as well as the aforesaid
                jurors have placed our seals in turn on this indented inquiry on the day and year
                first aforesaid.</ab>

Oglander's

            <p> This biography of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/122058/" type="Person_Gentry">Sir John Leigh</rs> is the longest of a number of similar
              biographies of prominent members of the local aristocracy on the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/2363/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Isle of Wight</rs>. <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/122275/" type="Person_Commoner">John Dingley</rs> was deputy lieutenant of the island to <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/116753/" type="Person_Nobility">Sir George Carey</rs> (1547‚Äì1603), later 2nd Baron Hunsdon, but Dingley's son-
              in-law John Leigh lived with his father-in-law and was more active and so did most of
              the work, leading Carey to appoint Leigh his deputy when Dingley died. Leigh continued
              as deputy under the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/83892/" type="Collective_Title">earl of Southampton</rs> after Carey's death in 1603. Thus
              the Sir John Leigh that Oglander has in mind here was some thirty-five years
              Oglander's senior. Oglander reports that Leigh died on 19 January 1629/30, when
              Oglander's reckoning would have put his age at about eighty, for 'Sir John wase taken
              with a ded palsy <gap reason="omitted"/> when he wase abowt 30 yeres of adge <gap reason="omitted"/> and he lived with that palsy <gap reason="omitted"/> 50 yeres'
              (Oglander, <title>Oglander Memoirs</title>, pp 142‚Äì7).

              <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/41249/" type="Thing_SetMachinery">pole</rs> before they were married refers to an event that
              probably occurred some years before Oglander's own birth rather than an event he had

              Buckingham led a naval force to try to lift the siege of the Huguenots at La Rochelle.
              They were both back in <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/87185/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Portsmouth</rs> in August of 1628 when Buckingham was

            <p>The characters are grouped with brackets to the right. In the left column the first
              four names are bracketed, then the second four. After a space, the next fourteen names
              are not bracketed, nor is (after a space) ‚Äòmorte atropos‚Äô; the next bracket begins
              with ‚Äòmarte‚Äô and includes five names, ending with ‚Äòage.‚Äô The next bracket joins
              ‚Äòimpatience,‚Äô ‚Äòdolor,‚Äô and ‚Äòmaladie‚Äô; the last bracket the remaining two names. In the
              second column, the first seven names are bracketed. Then there is a space and eleven
              names that are not bracketed, followed by another space. After the space the first
              three names are bracketed, then two, then four, then two and two, with the final
              bracket extending to the left under ‚Äòexercise.‚Äô</p>
            <p>The editors have not been able to identify this description as a known <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/168819/" type="Drama_TitledWork">morality play</rs> or allegorical pageant, and Martin Wiggins, author of <title>British Drama</title>,
              has privately indicated to them that this play does not appear to correspond with any
              extant play or any known post-Reformation lost play (Wiggins suggests the play may be
              mid-sixteenth century and has assigned the play a provisional catalogue number of
              276.5). Almost half of the allegorical figures named in the list on f [13] correspond
              to characters in the <hi rend="italic">Roman de la Rose</hi>, the French
              thirteenth-century allegorical poem by Guilliaume de Lorris and Jean de Meun. Some are
              spelled as in the <hi rend="italic">Roman</hi>, while others have been rendered in an
              attempt at Italian. The scenes described on f [12] do not, however, resemble the
              narrative of the poem, so it is difficult to ascertain the extent to which the <hi rend="italic">Roman de la Rose</hi> influenced the writer(s) of the description and
              list.</p>
            <p>The list of characters does not appear to be in <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/113645/" type="Person_Gentry">Sir
                Richard Paulet</rs>'s hand, though the description may be; it has signs of being
              written rapidly, perhaps during a performance, much as Paulet's Parliamentary Diary
              does. Paulet certainly showed an interest in plays, as he purchased a number of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/70656/" type="Thing_BookPlayMusic">play texts</rs>, as well as attending <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40453/" type="Drama_Type">plays</rs>. He may have been recording the argument of a play he had seen, or this
              document may be some kind of plan for a performance of a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/129826/" type="Drama_Type">morality play</rs> that he somehow acquired. The use of French in the list of
              characters is reminiscent of the French (or perhaps Frenchified) names of the
              signatories to the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/127860/" type="Entertainer_Type">Maskers</rs>' Letter of 1586, but the possibility that this
              document is a description of the performance of those maskers is highly conjectural
              (see <ptr target="#hamps-ridp223495616"/>). The two different hands of the character
              list and the description do not resemble the hand of the Maskers' Letter. </p>

            <p>The Paulet family was resident at Freefolk.</p>
            <p>The <rs ref="eats:127860" type="Entertainer_Type">maskers</rs>' letter indicates that
              they are waiting at <rs ref="eats:123118" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Basingstoke</rs>
              for a chance to visit <rs ref="eats:113645" type="Person_Gentry">Paulet</rs>, so it is
              likely their letter was delivered at Paulet's residence at <rs ref="eats:255340" type="Place_F_Residence">Herriard House</rs>, which is much closer to Basingstoke
              than is <rs ref="eats:106707" type="Place_F_Residence">Freefolk</rs>.</p>
            <p> The French salutation and apparently French names of the signatories might mean this
              group of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/127860/" type="Entertainer_Type">performers</rs> was genuinely French, but it seems at least
              as likely that the performers were English and the French names were part of their <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40416/" type="Drama_Type">masking
                performance</rs>. Unfortunately, none of these individuals can be identified, either
              as professional performers or as local <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1967/" type="Place_County">Hampshire</rs> men who might be friends or tenants of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/113645/" type="Person_Gentry">Paulet</rs>'s. None of the names appear in Kathman's <title>Biographical
                Index</title> (http://shakespeareauthorship.com/bd/), or in the personal names index
              at the Hampshire Record Office. The one hint the letter gives as to what the
              performers intended to do for Paulet comes when they announce that they wish 'to trye
                o<ex>u</ex>r treasure that is leafte, and prove howe beste we maye/ increase the
              same, or else w<ex>i</ex>th losse goe emptye quyte awaye.' The 'treasure' may refer to
              some tangible objects, whose value could be increased or lost in some form of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40677/" type="Entertainment_Type">gambling</rs> or gift-exchange with Paulet. If so, they had in mind a very old form
              of masking like the mumming of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/36947/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">London's</rs> city fathers before <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/32403/" type="Person_Royalty">Richard II</rs> at the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/124406/" type="Place_F_Residence">palace of Kennington</rs> at Christmastide 1377.

              the king would win the gifts they had brought. The mummers then <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/18451/" type="Entertainer_Type">danced</rs> on one side of the the hall, while the king and his entourage danced on

            <p> The <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1140/" type="Collective_Office">mayor</rs> of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/72712/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Southampton</rs> in 1599 (p 41) was <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/130307/" type="Person_Gentry">Thomas Lambert</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/113645/" type="Person_Gentry">Paulet</rs>'s cousin because their mothers were sisters, both
              daughters of Richard Andrews of Laverstoke. Like Paulet, Lambert was knighted and
              served as an MP for Southampton, and the two men engaged in several business and land
              ventures together. It was likely through Lambert that Paulet became acquainted with
              'Mr Beston,' at whose house he paid <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1243/" type="Entertainer_Type">musicians</rs>. <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/130388/" type="Person_Commoner">Richard Beiston</rs> was a merchant adventurer who had twice
              been <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1140/" type="Collective_Office">mayor</rs> of Southampton (Butler, <title>Book of
                Fines</title>, vol 3, pp 221‚Äì2).</p>
            <p> The date of the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/14146/" type="Drama_Character">lord of misrule</rs> entry (p 42) is uncertain. A line is
              drawn through the accounts thirteen entries above, and labelled July 1600, which
              probably indicates the ending date of the entries above the line, many of which are
              specifically dated as May or June 1600. Entries between that line and the lord of
              misrule entry carry dates ranging from 23 July through August, September, October, and
              November, to 29 December for the entry four above the one for the lord of misrule. On
              the other hand, the entry three after the one transcribed is for 14 October. Still, it
              seems likely that the lord of misrule would have been rewarded at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/41461/" type="CalendarDay_Liturgical">Christmastide</rs>. Also no place is indicated, though
              Paulet's main residence at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/106707/" type="Place_F_Residence">Freefolk</rs> seems most likely (or possibly his other house at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/87010/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Herriard</rs>). </p>

            <p>The <rs ref="eats:221085" type="Person_Family">Paulet family</rs> was resident at <rs ref="eats:106707" type="Place_F_Residence">Freefolk</rs>.</p>
            <p> In the entry concerning payments on 7 January at ffarleye (<rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/123775/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Farleigh Wallop</rs>), the final item reads '&amp; S. to
              the horsman 2d. ‚Äì iiij s. ij d.' (f [11v]). The capital 'S' may simply be the
              abbreviation for shillings, mistakenly written here and not deleted. It may, however,
              be an abbreviation for 'Samborne,' that is, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/115469/" type="Person_Commoner">James Samborne</rs>, who is frequently paid elsewhere in these accounts for acting
              on <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/113645/" type="Person_Gentry">Paulet</rs>'s behalf. At the top of f [3] Paulet uses 'S' for 'Son' in 'my S
              Iervois' ‚Äì his adopted son, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/115534/" type="Person_Gentry">Thomas Jervois</rs> ‚Äì but Samborne seems more likely to have been making this
              payment to the horseman.</p>
            <p> The entry for the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1243/" type="Entertainer_Type">musicians</rs> on f [14v] seems to be squeezed into the
              bottom of the bracket that surrounds the other entries, with a horizontal line running
              through the middle of the entry that goes to the 'xij d.' at the right margin, but
              also connects to the bottom of the bracket. It seems more likely to be a late addition
              than a cross- out. The amounts for gifts add up to the 7s 2d in the right margin
              without the 12d to the musicians, so the payment to musicians should be treated as a
              separate entry rather than part of the bracketed gifts. Richard Samborne may be a son
              or brother of James Samborne, who was Thomas Jervoise's tutor and steward to Richard
              Paulet. 'poules Sermon' refers to a sermon given at St Paul‚Äôs Cathedral in London,
              likely at Paul‚Äôs Cross in the cathedral churchyard, which was a regular site for
              sermons. In his ‚ÄòParliamentary Diary‚Äô Paulet often mentions going to hear sermons at
              Paul‚Äôs Cross.</p>

                Em<ex>er</ex>y iij s. iiij d.' (f [5v], <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/135755/" type="Person_Commoner">John Emery</rs> was <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1140/" type="Collective_Office">mayor</rs> this year.)</p>
            <p> On f 2v, the Cutthorn was the boundary marker of the north-east corner of the city's
              liberties and was located at the northern end of the modern Southampton Common. The
              Court Leet traditionally met at that spot (Thick, <title>Southampton Steward's
                Book</title>, p 91, n 73).</p>
            <p> Entries in the draft accounts (SC5/1/3, f 6) suggest that the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/8709/" type="Entertainer_Type">minstrels</rs> who were given 20d on the 13 January 1433/4 (f 2v) were then given
              wages for part of the year as <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/13000/" type="Collective_Office">minstrels of Southampton</rs>, and they continued as the port town's musicians for
              some years thereafter.</p>
            <p> The entry concerning the minstrel's wages on f 4v does not occur in the list of
              similar wages paid to all the civic officials, though the next entry is for 20d to
              Nicholas Clerk of St Michael's for ringing the curfew bell. The latter, however, is a
              payment for the full year. Seven entries separate the two groups of entries here. The
              payment of wages on f 7v does occur with other wages paid for that quarter, perhaps
              suggesting that the payment for the quarter ending at midsummer was unusual in some
              way.</p>
            <p> The payments to minstrels on f 8 occur in a large group of expenses of the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1140/" type="Collective_Office">mayor</rs> for travel to <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/107462/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Waltham</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/79157/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Winchester</rs>, and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/36947/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">London</rs>. However, the rewards to minstrels occur
              immediately after expenses for the craneman's livery, so these payments were probably
              given at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/72712/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Southampton</rs> by the mayor at various times of the
              year. </p>

            <p>John of Lancaster (1389-1435) was first duke of Bedford from 1414. See <ref target="https://library2.utm.utoronto.ca/otra/reed/node/316158">P&amp;P</ref>.</p>
            <p>John Holand (1350-1399/1400) was duke of Exeter from 1397, with residences at Pultney House (London), Berkhampstead Castle (Hertfordshire), Dartington Hall (Devon). See <ref target="https://library2.utm.utoronto.ca/otra/reed/node/316107">P&amp;P</ref></p>
            <p>Henry Beaufort (1375-1447) was bishop of Winchester from 1404, with residences at Wolvesey Palace in Winchester and Bishops Waltham (Hampshire), as well as Winchester Palace (Surrey). See <ref target="https://library2.utm.utoronto.ca/otra/reed/node/315916">P&amp;P</ref>.</p>
            <p>Richard de Beauchamp (1381/2)-1439) was thirteenth earl of Warwick from 1401, with residences at Warwick Castle (Warwickshire) and Hanley Castle (Worcestershire). See <ref target="https://library2.utm.utoronto.ca/otra/reed/node/315922">P&amp;P</ref>.</p>
            <p> The entry on f 6 of these draft accounts reveals what SC5/1/2 (<ptr target="#hamps-ridp224739600"/>) does not, that the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/8709/" type="Entertainer_Type">minstrels</rs> given partial wages on 16 January and thereafter paid as <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/13000/" type="Collective_Office">Southampton's</rs> minstrels were given a reward on 13 January as <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/79157/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">minstrels 'de Wynchester.'</rs> Whether 'de' means 'of' or 'from,' it seems that
              these entries record the hiring of at least these two men, who were not residents of
                <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/72712/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Southampton</rs>, to become the civic minstrels. Perhaps
              the performance on 13 January was a kind of audition. The entries on this page are not
              written all the way to the bottom of the page as they are elsewhere in this
              manuscript. Instead only five entries follow the heading: 'It<ex>e</ex>m
                <del>conss</del> concessum est die <del>die</del> d<ex>om</ex>inica vz. xvij<hi rend="superscript">o</hi> die Ianuar<ex>ij</ex> p<ex>er</ex> Ioh<ex>ann</ex>em

              payments indicates the adoption by the mayor and burgesses of this new set of
              minstrels. </p>

            <p> The steward for this year sets 'It' well to the left of the rest of each entry on f
              10, and there is no clear mark of abbreviation; abbreviation has been assumed and the
              abbreviation appropriately expanded. The 'u' in 'waytus' and 'Gownus' is peculiar, but
              obvious in the former, though it could be an 'i' in 'Gownus.' No punctuation follows
              'Gownus,' so it seems likely that this <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/136918/" type="Person_Commoner">John Lane</rs> is a member of the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/13000/" type="Collective_Office">waits</rs>.

              is struck through, with the amount separately struck through. It is the only entry on

              steward's accounts if they had survived.

              Montagew should have been the one to pay the minstrels, four years before he became a
              burgess, is not clear (Butler, <title>Book of Fines</title>, vol 1, pp 54, 173). </p>

            <p> Butler transcribes 'mynstr<ex>elles</ex>' as 'mynistr' (<title>Book of
              Fines</title>, vol 1, p 55; Butler expands abbreviations silently). There may be an
              abbreviation mark after the 'n,' as well as the very clear abbreviation mark after the
              'r.' The word comes at the end of the line and appears to be squeezed in before the
              bracket that links both lines of the entry; in fact, it appears that the clerk first
              wrote 'min' with an abbreviation mark after the 'n' and then realized he had room to
              add 'str' with an abbreviation mark to make the meaning clearer. Thus, '<rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/8709/" type="Entertainer_Type">minstrels</rs>' seems the more likely reading, especially since the previous year a
              payment was given to the king's mother's 'mynstrell<ex>es</ex>.'</p>

              two years together. All three pages of accounts for this year are crossed through. The
              first folio (66) has an unfinished sum at the bottom, while the second folio of
              receipts and the folio of payments are never summed. The accounts are followed by a
              blank folio (67v), which is unusual in these accounts, suggesting that they are
              incomplete and perhaps draft accounts.</p>

              whom they and the mayor went to welcome at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/79157/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Winchester</rs>; it may have been <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/139370/" type="Person_Clergy">Stephen Gardiner</rs>, who became <rs ref="eats:154663" type="Collective_ClergyAndChurchwardens">bishop of Winchester</rs> in November 1531.

            <p> The <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1140/" type="Collective_Office">mayor</rs> made rather more numerous payments this year
              (half a page worth) than during the 1530s. The mayor's draft accounts for this year
              survive (SC5/3/3) and contain the rewards to Hartford's minstrels and Sussex's
              players. They also include a payment to the lord privy seal's minstrels that has been
              crossed out, no doubt because it belongs to the following year, 1542‚Äì3, which is where
              it has been entered in the Book of Fines. </p>

            <p>Mary Tudor (1515/16-1558) was queen of England from 1553. See <ref target="https://library2.utm.utoronto.ca/otra/reed/node/315888">P&amp;P</ref>.</p>
            <p> The third entry contains an apparently otiose vertical line between 'Satten' and
              'made.' The fourth entry appears to end at 'gowne' with the final line added, with a
              bracket at the right extending down to the end just above the horizontal line
              following 'Vincente.' Only a single amount is entered for these lines.</p>
            <p> For 'fett' in the second and third entries (that is, 'fetch' and 'fetched'
              respectively), Burch reads 'sett' (p 30), but the ligature from 's' to 'e' in this
              hand usually comes from the top right hand end (the right end of the curving top of
              the stroke), whereas this ligature comes from the middle of the vertical stroke, as if
              the crossing of the 'f'; 'f' and 's' are otherwise indistinguishable in this hand.

            <p> Although 'Item' is written out in full, an otise abbreviation mark of a horizontal
              line consistently appears over it in the hand of this year's accounts. The heading
              gives the regnal years of these accounts as 12‚Äì13 Elizabeth, but the following year's
              accounts are also so headed, and internal dates in the next set of accounts suggest
              that this one is in fact for 11‚Äì12 Elizabeth, 1569‚Äì70.</p>
            <p> Butler (<title>Book of Fines</title>, vol 2, p 84) transcribes the second entry on
              this folio thus: 'Item the xth of maye payed unto mr Shuxborowe fare Lace vjd. for
              nayles iijd. to sette uppe the Revills of the Kinge in the <term ref="gloss:audicthowse-1">Audict howsse</term> ixd.' Such a record would certainly
              merit inclusion in this edition. However, the word Butler has transcribed as 'Revills'
              seems clearly to instead be 'Roulls,' which would also make more sense in the context
              of the Audit House. </p>

            <p> Both this year's and the previous year's accounts are dated 12‚Äì13 Elizabeth.
              However, the last two leaves of the previous year's accounts are labelled '1570' at
              the top of each leaf, while these accounts are headed '1571' at the top of each leaf,
              so these accounts seem likely to be the ones for 1570‚Äì1. In fact, the mistake was made
              a few years earlier, when the regnal years given in the headings suddenly skip from
              8‚Äì9 Elizabeth to 10‚Äì11 Elizabeth. After the correction made in this year's heading,
              the regnal years no longer conflict with dates given within the accounts. </p>

            <p> The accounts for this year are both very extensive and very detailed. Although
              individual entries are clearly dated to 1576‚Äì7, the heading gives regnal years of
              19‚Äì20 Elizabeth, which would translate to 1577‚Äì8. (The dating by regnal years again
              gets a year out of step with the heading of the 1573‚Äì4 accounts as 16‚Äì17 Elizabeth (f
              147), following the accounts for 14‚Äì15 Elizabeth ‚Äì there is no set of accounts headed
              15‚Äì16 Elizabeth. The error becomes clear with the accounts for 1576‚Äì7, which are
              headed 19‚Äì20 Elizabeth (which would be 1577‚Äì8) but are twice dated internally to 1577
              before Michaelmas.) </p>

            <p>Elizabeth Tudor (1533-1602/3) was queen of England from 1558. See <ref target="https://library2.utm.utoronto.ca/otra/reed/node/315890">P&amp;P</ref>.</p>
            <p>Henry Radcliffe (1533-1593) was ninth earl of Sussex from 1583, with residences at New Hall (Essex) and Bermondsey House (Surrey). See <ref target="https://library2.utm.utoronto.ca/otra/reed/node/316278">P&amp;P</ref>.</p>
            <p>Robert Devereux (1565-1600/1) was nineteenth earl of Essex from 1576, with residences at Chartley (Staffordshire), Lamphey Court (Pembrokeshire), Essex House and York House (London). See <ref target="https://library2.utm.utoronto.ca/otra/reed/node/315846">P&amp;P</ref>.</p>
            <p> As the entry concerning Essex's players (f 197v) indicates, the regnal years given
              in the headings of the accounts are still one year out, as 28‚Äì9 Elizabeth would be
              1586‚Äì7. The '23<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of March 85' is of course 23 March 1586
              by modern reckoning, as the new year number was not used until <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/72087/" type="CalendarDay_Liturgical">Lady Day</rs> (25 March). The entry for the queen's
              bearward (f 197) appears two entries above one for 4 December and four above one for 3
              January, so it probably belongs to the autumn of 1585. </p>

            <p> This is the second year headed 28‚Äì9 Elizabeth, correctly here. Many dates were given
              in this set of accounts, suggesting some care in ordering them chronologically. Four

              1586, while the entry immediately after the Leicester entry is dated 23 March. The
              entry preceding the one for the lord admiral's players (f 205) is dated 15 May, but no

            <p>Henry Radcliffe (1533-1593) was ninth earl of Sussex from 1583, with residences at New Hall (Essex) and Bermondsey House (Surrey). See <ref target="https://library2.utm.utoronto.ca/otra/reed/node/316278">P&amp;P</ref>.</p>

            <p> The 'Queenes ma{ies}tie &amp; the Earle of Sussex players' (f 225) was a single

            <p>Elizabeth Tudor (1533-1602/3) was queen of England from 1558. See <ref target="https://library2.utm.utoronto.ca/otra/reed/node/315890">P&amp;P</ref>.</p>
            <p>Charles Howard (1536-1624) was Lord High Admiral 1585-1618-19 and tenth earl of Nottingham from 1597, with residence at Effingham (Surrey). See <ref target="https://library2.utm.utoronto.ca/otra/reed/node/316133">P&amp;P</ref>.</p>

              that this is a rough account to be copied into the mayor's accounts, or perhaps the

            <p>Edward Seymour (1561-1612) was Lord Beauchamp from 1561. See <ref target="https://library2.utm.utoronto.ca/otra/reed/node/316320">P&amp;P</ref>.</p>
            <p>Elizabeth Tudor (1533-1602/3) was queen of England from 1558. See <ref target="https://library2.utm.utoronto.ca/otra/reed/node/315890">P&amp;P</ref>.</p>
            <p> On f 15v <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/131827/" type="Person_Gentry">Tilney</rs>'s signature is part of last line of the licence,
              which comes to the very bottom of the page. The blank spaces appear to have been left
              to accommodate more names of the acting company. On Tilney and his activities as <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/61914/" type="Collective_Office">master of the revels</rs>, see W.R. Streitberger, <title>Masters of the Revels and
                Elizabeth I's Court Theatre</title> (Oxford, 2016). Lord Beauchamp was <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/130875/" type="Person_Nobility">Edward Seymour </rs>(1561‚Äì1612), son of the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/144234/" type="Person_Nobility">Edward Seymour</rs> who was <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/30047/" type="Collective_Title">earl of Hertford</rs> and who had angered the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/11772/" type="Person_Royalty">queen</rs> by marrying <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/144352/" type="Person_Nobility">Katherine Grey</rs>, younger sister of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/144455/" type="Person_Royalty">Lady Jane Grey</rs>, without Elizabeth's consent in 1560. Hertford was imprisoned
              until his wife's death in 1568 and spent a long time regaining his standing with the
              queen. In September of 1591 Hertford hosted Elizabeth on <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40648/" type="Entertainment_Type">progress</rs> at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/155525/" type="Place_F_Residence">Elvetham</rs>, in north-eastern <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1967/" type="Place_County">Hampshire</rs>, providing elaborate <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/62012/" type="Entertainment_Type">shows</rs> for her entertainment. Beauchamp's right to the title was in dispute for
              most of his life, since his parents' marriage had been declared void and Beauchamp
              himself illegitimate (<title>ODNB</title>).</p>
            <p> There is no way of knowing why the civic authorities in <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/72712/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Southampton</rs> decided to start copying the players' licences in 1591. One
              possibility is that the town wanted to be able to refuse permission to play to some
              visiting companies, and the language of both this licence and the following one makes
              clear the town's right to deny permission to any companies that could not produce such
              a licence.<rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/175683/" type="Collective_Troupe"> Beauchamp's men</rs> had only recently gotten into trouble
              in <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/73838/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Norwich</rs>, where in June 1590 they were refused
              permission to play and given 20s to leave town without performing, but according to
              the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1140/" type="Collective_Office">mayor</rs>'s court 'notw<ex>i</ex>thstonding they did sett

                <title>Norwich</title>, REED (Toronto, Buffalo and London, 1984), 96). <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/179356/" type="Person_Commoner">John 'Mufford,'</rs> as the Norwich record calls him, was jailed for a time for his
              temerity, which likely means he was the leader of the group. <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/180413/" type="Person_Commoner">Thomas Blackwood</rs> is the only other actor in the group who is mentioned
              elsewhere, as a member of Worcester's men in 1602 (E.K. Chambers, <title>Elizabethan
                Stage</title>, vol 2 (Oxford, 1923), 226, 303). Beauchamp's players were never a
              particularly successful company, but 1590‚Äì1 was one of their busiest years, as they
              were recorded at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/123162/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Faversham</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/123184/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Lydd</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/123206/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">New Romney</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/73838/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Norwich</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/37840/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">York</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/123228/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Shrewsbury</rs>, and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/123250/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Gloucester</rs>, as well as at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/72712/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Southampton</rs> (REED, <title>Patrons and Performances</title>, <hi rend="italic">sv</hi> 'Seymour, Edward (1561‚Äì1612),'

            <p> The licence copied on f 23v concerns the Dutton brothers, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/180666/" type="Person_Commoner">John</rs> and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/180596/" type="Person_Commoner">Laurence</rs>, who began their acting careers in the early
              1570s, joining the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/12706/" type="Collective_Troupe">earl of Warwick's company</rs> in the late 1570s and then
              shifting to the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/50533/" type="Collective_Troupe">earl of Oxford's men</rs> in 1580 (Kathman,
                <title>Biographical Index</title>, ). John became a member of the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/17169/" type="Collective_Troupe">queen's men</rs> when the master of the revels assembled that 'all‚Äìstar' company in
              1583. By 1591 the queen's men were no longer the pre-eminent company in the land or
              even at court; <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/181689/" type="Person_Commoner">Tarlton</rs> had died and some of their earlier members had
              left. Records from around the country suggest that two different companies were
              travelling in the queen's name in 1591, one led by John Lanham, the other by the
              Duttons (Scott McMillin and Sally-Beth MacLean, <title> The Queen's Men and their
                Plays</title> (Cambridge and New York, 1998; rpt 2006), 11‚Äì12, 52‚Äì3, 62). One can
              easily imagine the mayor at Southampton asking the Duttons to produce their licence
              and having it copied into the town records, when only a short time before (on <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/41869/" type="CalendarDay_Liturgical">Shrove Sunday</rs>, 14 February) the town had paid a
              different group calling themselves the queen's players (see <ptr target="#hamps-ridp227867600"/>, ff 225, 226v). The earlier visitors were likely
              Lanham's group, as the Duttons were paid for performing at court in January, February,
              and March of 1590/1 (W.R. Streitberger, <title> The Masters of the Revels and
                Elizabeth I's Court Theatre</title> (Oxford, 2016), 278). </p>

            <p>Anne of Denmark (1574-1618/19) was queen of England from 1603. See <ref target="https://library2.utm.utoronto.ca/otra/reed/node/315847">P&amp;P</ref>.</p>
            <p> While the warrant was originally written on 7 March 1605/6, the copying of the
              warrant cannot be dated very exactly: it is preceded by copies of petitions to both
                <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/11772/" type="Person_Royalty">Elizabeth</rs> and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/17496/" type="Person_Royalty">James</rs> about how <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/72712/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Southampton</rs> was suffering from encroachment on its monopoly of the sweet <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40997/" type="Thing_FoodDrink">wine</rs> trade. None of these, including the last and longest to James, is dated.
              The item following this warrant, on f 203, is dated 12 November 1606. The dated item
              closest but before the warrant (f 192v) is dated November 1606 and the one before that
              (f 191v) 26 October 1606, so it seems likely that the queen's men visited Southampton
              in the fall, possibly early November, and their warrant was copied at that time.</p>
            <p> The outside edge of the leaf has been trimmed in the process of repairing the
              manuscript, leading to occasional missing letters (here indicated by the diamond
              brackets). </p>

              of 11 December 1607, in which Greene and Tompson are given two silver <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/42646/" type="Thing_LiveryRegalia">scutcheons</rs>).</p>
            <p> Connor writes of the 'scutchins' on f 39: 'The three roses are of course part of the
              blazon of the town arms; the H and tun are a reference to Hamtun, a form of the name
              by which the town was still known at this time' (<title>Southampton Mayor's
                Book</title>, p 110, n 392). The scutcheons still exist among the corporation plate
              and a photograph of one appears on the cover of Burch, <title>Minstrels and
                Players</title>.</p>
            <p> The entire entry concerning <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/146198/" type="Person_Commoner">John Sopp</rs> on f 39v has been struck though. According to Connor, the plague
              referred to must have occurred in 1604 (<title>Southampton Mayor's Book</title>, p
              111, n 404).</p>
            <p> The first entry on f 41 appears to be in error. It seems likely that Greene was
              never intended to take <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/147094/" type="Person_Commoner">Fryce</rs> as an <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/55239/" type="Collective_Occupation">apprentice</rs> but that the scribe mistook the Fryce
              case for Sopp's, which follows immediately after, and cancelled the erroneous
              reference to Greene. Of course it is possible that the council did intend to
              apprentice Fryce to Greene as well and then changed their minds, so that the reference
              to Greene was cancelled and the note about finding Fryce a master was added before
              turning to Sopp's case. The marginal note that assigns the boy to
              <!--<rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/147155/" type="Person_Commoner">-->Heravill<!--</rs>-->
              was almost certainly added at a later date. </p>

            <p> A 'hughster' or huckster was someone licensed by the council to buy goods, primarily
              food and wood, at the market before the market was officially open. The hucksters
              would then re-sell those goods at a higher price. Court leet juries frequently tried
              to limit the activities of the hucksters, since they sometimes bought up the entire
              supplies of certain goods in order to force people to buy at their inflated prices.
              However, as this record shows, the council continued to permit some people to support
              themselves by huckstering. In the case of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/146133/" type="Person_Commoner">Greene</rs>, it appears that what he made as a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1243/" type="Entertainer_Type">musician</rs> was insufficient, so the council allowed him to seek additional
              income as a huckster (Hearnshaw and Hearnshaw, <title>Court Leet Records</title>,

<p>Anne of Denmark (1574-1618/19) was queen of England from 1603.

              lighter and these words were added above the line of the bracket, perhaps for
              clarification. Slater's and Swinnerton's names appear almost exclusively in the
              provincial records, sometimes in doubtful circumstances that suggest they may have
              been members of companies that were using the names and even duplicate patents of

              <ab><gap reason="omitted"/>Likewise, because, by incautious and unregulated games
                carried out in the chapel, cloister, or hall of our said college, near Winchester,
                from the insolence perhaps of some in the same, the said chapel and hall could
                frequently be damaged or even deformed in the walls, stables, pictures, and glass
                windows, and elsewhere, we, desiring to make provision for the security of these
                things, strictly prohibit the throwing of stones and balls and anything else in the
                aforesaid chapel, cloister, stables, and hall, and, in addition, dances, wrestling
                matches, and any other incautious and unregulated games done at any time ever, by
                which, or by any one of which, damage or loss in material or form could be inflicted
                in any way to the sumptuous buildings, in the aforesaid chapel, cloister, and hall.
                Likewise, because the grammar schools, in which the scholars of our said college
                will be obliged to learn and study, are situated below the aforesaid hall, which in
                the manner of a solarium stands raised up and built above the ground, they (<hi rend="italic">ie,</hi> the scholars), by wrestling matches, dances, revelry,
                leaping, singing, clamours, tumult and excessive noise, spillings of water, beer,
                and other liquids, and tulmultuous games, perhaps occurring in that very hall, could
                easily and plausibly be hindered in their study and learning and otherwise sustain
                serious damage to books (and) clothes. We, therefore, strictly prohibit that any
                wrestling matches, dances, revelry, leaping, singing, clamours, tumult and excessive
                noise, spillings of water, beer, and other liquids, and tumultuous games of this
                sort and any other irregularities of any kind take place in the aforesaid hall at
                any time ever, by which, or by any one of which, the aforesaid scholars could be
                hindered in any way from their study or learning or otherwise sustain damage or
                grievance to their books, clothing, or other things, or by which the hall itself, in
                its ornamentation or fabric, below or above, inside or outside, in any part of it,
                could be disfigured or suffer injury or damage. And if anyone should be found guilty
                in the premises or in any one of the premises, he shall make thorough satisfaction
                for the damage inflicted by him. And nevertheless, in order that the punishment of
                one may be the fear of many, let him be punished harshly by the withholding of his
                commons, or otherwise, according to the discretion and arrangement of the warden and
                vice-warden, the bursars, and the sacrist of the said college, according to the
                magnitude of the offence without any partiality whatsoever. <gap reason="omitted"/>

              <ab>John Yerd complains against Richard Syngere on a plea of trespass. And whereupon
                he also complains that, although it was thus agreed between the aforesaid Richard
                and John on 4 July in the tenth year of the reign of the now lord, King Henry, at
                Winchester that the said John would play the steward in a play called 'play of St
                Agnes' with the said Richard on the sixteenth day then next following and (that) the
                same Richard would find for the same John the clothing and all other gear suitable
                for such a steward together with his costs and expenses in the meantime, yet this
                Richard did not find for the said John either his clothing or victuals or costs and
                expenses as was agreed among them. Wherefore he (<hi rend="italic">ie,</hi> John)
                claims that he is injured and incurs a loss to the value of 40s and thereupon he
                brings (suit). And the aforesaid Richard, present in court, denies the force (<hi rend="italic">ie,</hi> of the accusation) and the injury; wherefore, etc. And he
                claims that there was never such a bargain between them just as, etc, and on this
                matter he demands to be tried by the country (<hi rend="italic">ie,</hi> he demands
                a jury trial) and the aforesaid John (does) likewise. Therefore provision was made
                for an officer of the court to cause a jury, etc, to come, by whom, etc, for the
                next Wednesday, etc. The same day, etc.</ab>

                Selver, and John Yerd on a plea of trespass. And whereupon he complains that the
                aforesaid John, Richard Trowbyk, William, and John came with force and arms,
                assaults, staves, and knives at Winchester on the Sunday next after the feast of the
                Translation of St Thomas the Martyr in the tenth year of our now lord King Henry,
                and there they broke into and entered the home of that very Richard against his will
                and made an attack upon him (and) so beat, wounded, and maltreated him that his life
                was despaired of. And they inflicted other crimes on him, namely, they took one
                original of St Agnes and one cloth called 'playing cloth' total price 10s, from the
                goods and chattels of that very Richard Syngere and carried them away unjustly and
                contrary to the peace of our lord king, &amp;c, and to a loss to that very Richard
                Syngere of 100s and thereupon he brings suit, &amp;c. And the aforesaid John
                Fromond, weaver, Richard Trowbyk, William Selver, and John Yerd, present in court,
                deny the force (<hi rend="italic"> ie,</hi> of the accusation) and the injury,
                wherefore, etc, and the damages, etc. And they claim that they are not guilty
                thereof and on this matter they demand (that they be tried) by the country
                (requested to be tried by jury), etc, and the aforesaid Richard Syngere likewise,
                etc. Therefore provision was made for an officer of the court to cause a jury, etc,
                to come before the eighth day, etc, by whom, etc. The same day, etc.</ab>

            <p> Dating these records to 1409 is dependent on matching the names of civic officials
              mentioned in them to other records, showing that the King Henry meant here is Henry
              IV. The alleged <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/45614/" type="CrimesMisdemeanors">burglary</rs> happened on 'the sixteenth day then next
              following,' which could mean either 16 July or the sixteenth day after 4 July (20
              July).

            <p>Henry Beaufort (1375-1447) was bishop of Winchester from 1404, with residences at Wolvesey Palace in Winchester and Bishops Waltham (Hampshire), as well as Winchester Palace (Surrey). See <ref target="https://library2.utm.utoronto.ca/otra/reed/node/315916">P&amp;P</ref>.</p>
            <p>William Fitz Allan (1417-1487) was twenty-first earl of Arundel from 1438, with residence at Arundel Castle (Sussex). See <ref target="https://library2.utm.utoronto.ca/otra/reed/node/316072">P&amp;P</ref>.</p>
            <p> The Friday on f [15v] may be either 11 January (if the first term started,
              unusually, on the Saturday of Michaelmas itself) or more likely 18 January (if the
              term started as usual, one week after Michaelmas). Similarly the Wednesday on f [16v]
              is probably 23 January but would be 16 January if the year had started on Michaelmas
              itself. </p>

            <p>Edward of York (1442-1483) was Edward IV of England 1460/1-1470 and 1471-1483. See <ref target="https://library2.utm.utoronto.ca/otra/reed/node/316583">P&amp;P</ref>.</p>
            <p>Elizabeth Woodville (1437-1492) was queen of England from 1465 to 1483. See <ref target="https://library2.utm.utoronto.ca/otra/reed/node/316389">P&amp;P</ref>.</p>
            <p>Edward Plantagent (1470-1483) was prince of Wales 1471-1483 and King Edward V of England 1483. See <ref target="https://library2.utm.utoronto.ca/otra/reed/node/316251">P&amp;P</ref>.</p>
            <p> The 'D<ex>omi</ex>ni de Soakes' (mb [3]) likely refers to the liberty of <rs ref="eats:111630" type="Place_PA_Liberty">the Soke</rs>, just outside Winchester on the east side, between the River Itchen and St Giles' Hill. The city had no authority there, jurisdiction being in the
              hands of the bishop of Winchester (Keene and
              Rumble, <title>Survey</title>, p 72). The bishop might thus be termed the 'lord of the
              Soke' (at this time William Waynflete (<hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1400‚Äì86),
              bishop of Winchester (1447‚Äì86)), but it is unclear why the chamberlains would do so in
              this single case. The prince's minstrels also visited the college in this year (see <ptr target="#hamps-ridp242785248"/>). </p>

            <p> The payment to the minstrels of the king's mother comes toward the end of this set
              of accounts, so the date of the payment may have been 26 September 1485, even though
              the account was supposed to have ended the previous day. In that case the king would
              have been Henry VII and his mother, Margaret Beaufort. However, if the payment was
              instead made on 26 September 1484, the king would have been Richard III and his

              prince until the birth of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/23984/" type="Person_Royalty">Edward</rs> in 1533. <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/43849/" type="Person_Royalty">Mary Tudor</rs> was not born until 1516, and Henry VIII‚Äôs

              that they had paid the prince's minstrels nothing, suggesting that a troupe under that
              name had indeed visited the city in this year, but the city recognized that the
              minstrels had no right to claim a prince as patron and so declined to reward them (see

              above the line suggests that the mayor may have given those minstrels a reward but was
              not allowed to recoup that reward from the city's coffers because someone realized

                <title>Rudens</title> and was evidently used on more than one occasion, hence the
              need for repairs to it. </p>

            <p> There were two churches dedicated to St Peter in <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/79157/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Winchester</rs> at this time (once there had been five): <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/107590/" type="Place_F_Church">St
                Peter's Colebrook</rs> and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/111652/" type="Place_F_Church">St
                Peter's Chesil</rs> (Keene and Rumble, <title>Medieval Winchester</title>, vol 1, pt
              1, p 135). It seems likely that the church involved was St Peter's Colebrook. The two
              parishes were contiguous, on the eastern side of the city, separated only by the River
              Itchen and the town wall, for St Peter's Chesil lay in the suburbs outside the East
              Gate in the area known as <rs ref="eats:111630" type="Place_PA_Liberty">the Soke</rs>,
              a separate jurisdiction from the city since 1231. The <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/154663/" type="Collective_Office">bishop of Winchester</rs> was the principal landlord in the Soke and the bishop
              appointed a steward or bailiff to administer this area, an official at times called
              the 'mayor of the Soke' in the records. The <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1140/" type="Collective_Office">mayor</rs> of the city of Winchester had no authority in the Soke, and thus would
              not have been concerned with <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/8782/" type="Entertainer_Type">players</rs> performing at St Peter's Chesil (Keene and Rumble, <title>Medieval
                Winchester</title>, vol 1, p 72). St Peter's Colebrook was originally in the
              precinct of St Mary's Abbey and the abbey may have been responsible for the survival
              of this rather poor parish, as the abbey was patron of church and provided annual
              support for the rector, support replaced in 1542 by an annual pension from the Crown.
              By 1652 the parish had declined so badly that the corporation ordered it united with
              that of St Maurice (Keene and Rumble, <title>Medieval Winchester</title>, vol 2, pts
              2‚Äì3, pp 847‚Äì8). </p>

            <p> The computus says 'ab octavo die Decembris 1627 usque ad die <hi rend="italic">(blank)</hi> euisdem mensis anni subsequentis viz 1628.' Despite this, the quarters
              appear to be as before. Certainly, the next accounting year starts in September as
              usual, so this December date may be a mistake. The second quarter of necessary
              expenses in this year includes a Christmas Day payment, which would bear out the idea
              that the December date is mentioned in error and that the accounts ran from Michaelmas
              to Michaelmas as usual. </p>

              <ab>Francis Hamlin has been attached to answer to Henry Fissher concerning a plea of
                offence on the case, and in respect whereof the same Henry Fissher through John
                Morne his attorney complains that, whereas the same Francis Hamlin, by his craft
                which he employs, was employed in the making and adjusting of stringed instruments,
                in English, fiddles or viols, and whereas the same <del>Francis</del> Henry was and
                is a pedotribe, in English, one who teaches children how to dance or exercise their
                bodies, and whereas on the twentieth day of August in the fifth year of the reign of
                our lord, King Charles, now of England, etc, here at the city of Winchester within
                the jurisdiction of this court, in consideration of 20d of legal English money paid
                by the same Henry to the same Francis in advance, and 7s to be paid by the same
                Henry to the same Francis after the making of two stringed instruments, in English,
                of two fiddles or viols, to be made for the same Henry by the same Francis, he
                undertook, and to the same Henry then and in the same place promised faithfully,
                that he himself, the same Francis, would make and adjust the two stringed
                instruments, in English, two fiddles or viols, for the same Henry within the fifteen
                days, in English, within the fortnight then next following. However, the aforesaid
                Francis, caring little for his aforesaid promise and undertaking, but contriving and
                intending deceitfully to cheat and defraud cunningly and wickedly the same Henry
                Fissher in this matter, did not make and adjust the two stringed instruments
                according to his aforesaid promise and undertaking. By which cause the same Henry
                Fissher has been deprived of and lost no small amount of profit and benefit in the
                profession of pedotribe, in which he was then employed and is still employed.
                Wherefore the same Henry says that he is damaged and has loss to the value of forty
                shillings, and in respect thereof he presents his suit, etc.</ab>

              <ab>On the holy day of Easter the seven canonical hours should be celebrated by monks
                in the Church of God after the custom of the canons, on account of the authority of
                St Gregory, pope of the apostolic see, as he himself set forth in his antiphonary.
                At a suitable time on the same night before the bells of matins are rung, the
                sacristans shall take up the cross and place it in its proper place. First, at
                nocturns, when the praise of God is begun by the abbot or any priest, he shall say
                once only 'O Lord, open my lips' in the church; then 'God, come to my aid' with the
                Gloria. Moreover, since the psalm 'Lord, how they are multiplied (who persecute me)'
                is omitted, the cantor shall begin the invitatory. Then (follow) three antiphons
                with three psalms, (and) when these are finished, the proper verse shall be said,
                (and) then as many lessons, with the responsories, properly belonging here. While
                the third lesson is being read, four brothers shall vest themselves, one of whom,
                wearing an alb and as if to do something else, shall enter and go unobtrusively to
                the location of the sepulchre and shall sit there quietly holding a palm in his
                hand. And while the third responsory is being said in full, the three remaining
                shall follow, all indeed vested in copes and carrying in their hands thuribles with
                incense, and step by step, in the likeness of those seeking something, shall come
                before the location of the sepulchre. For these things are done in imitation of the
                angel sitting in the tomb and of the women coming with spices to anoint the body of
                Jesus. When, therefore, the one sitting shall see the three come near him as if
                wandering and searching for something, he shall begin to sing sweetly in a moderate
                voice, 'Whom do you seek?' When this (antiphon) has been sung to the end, the three
                shall respond with one voice, 'Jesus of Nazareth.' He (shall reply) to them, 'He is
                not here. He has risen just as he had foretold. Go, announce that he has risen from
                the dead.' At the sound of this command, those three shall turn themselves to the
                choir, saying, 'Alleluia! The Lord is risen.' When this has been said, the one
                sitting, as if calling them back again, shall say the antiphon, 'Come and see the
                place.' Truly as he says this, he shall rise and lift the veil and show to them the
                place bare of the cross but only the linen cloths, in which the cross had been
                wrapped, placed (there). Seeing this, they shall lay down the thuribles which they
                had carried in the same sepulchre, and they shall take the linen and hold it out
                facing the clergy, and, as if showing that the Lord has risen and was no longer
                wrapped in it, they shall sing this antiphon: 'The Lord has risen from the
                sepulchre.' Then they shall lay the linen on the altar. When the antiphon is
                finished, the prior, rejoicing for triumph of our king because he rose after death
                had been overcome, shall begin the hymn 'We praise you, O God.' When this has begun,
                all the bells shall be struck in unison<gap reason="omitted"/>.</ab>

            <p> The edition of the <title>Regularis Concordia</title> that appears here, including
              the translation, was prepared by James M. Gibson (with assistance from Abigail Young
              and Patrick Gregory) for <title>Kent: Diocese of Canterbury</title>, vol 1, REED
              (Toronto and Buffalo, 2002), 23‚Äì7. Gibson describes the editorial approach in an
              endnote (<title>Kent</title>, vol 3, 263):</p>
            <p> 'The <title>Regularis Concordia</title> survives in two Latin manuscripts, one of
              which has an Anglo-Saxon gloss. Unlike most REED editions of texts surviving in
              multiple manuscripts, this edition does not adopt a base text to which the other text
              is collated, since neither of the Latin texts could be preferred for the excerpt
              included here. The Latin text printed here is therefore based upon a full collation
              and recension of the two manuscripts. Readings have been chosen for sense rather than
              according to the manuscript in which they are found; the text presented contains the
              best readings from both manuscripts. In keeping with REED practice, however, there is
              no textual emendation. Thus every word of the text can be found in one or both of the
              manuscripts, although the whole text cannot be found in either one of them. The
              critical apparatus reports all significant variants, using the orthography and
              capitalization of the MS in which they occur, but excludes minor variations in
              orthography, capitalization, and distinction between "et" and "&amp;." The text also
              departs from the standard REED practice of indicating with italics the expansion of
              abbreviations. The Anglo-Saxon text is given in full from BL: Cotton Tiberius
              A.III.'</p>
            <p> The collated manuscripts are BL Cotton Faustina B III, ff 188‚Äì9v <hi rend="italic">(F)</hi> and BL Cotton Tiberius A III, ff 21‚Äì1v <hi rend="italic">(T)</hi>. </p>

            <p> These entries occur between the itemized receipts for 1578‚Äì9 and the payments.
              Presumably the nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first years are regnal years of Queen
              Elizabeth, as this account was rendered in her twenty-first. The accounts for 1576‚Äì7
              and 1577‚Äì8 do not mention <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/35779/ http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40561/" type="Entertainment_Custom">king ales</rs>, so it is difficult to ascertain the
              meaning of these entries. Perhaps the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/3576/" type="Collective_ClergyAndChurchwardens">churchwardens</rs> had retained bills
              against the king ale receipts until an ale was held in 1579, allowing the wardens to
              pay all the creditors. </p>

            <p> The payment 'to the LL back againe'(p 49) may refer to the 'Ladyes' and 'Lordes'
              whose liveries are recorded further down that page, but it is uncertain whether that
              is the correct reading of the abbreviation or what it meant for 'LL' to be 'back
              againe.'</p>
            <p> It is not certain what the churchwardens meant by their payment 'to Whitburne for
              his play' (p 49). The other 'play' mentioned in the accounts is the 'play at Pewter'
              that appears to be some kind of gambling game, and perhaps Whitburne had organized or
              led the gambling. King ales did not normally have written play texts, so it is very
              unlikely the payment was for writing such a text. However, it could mean that
              Whitburne was being rewarded for playing in the sense of playing an instrument, as
              parishes often paid minstrels to contribute to the festivities. Or it might even mean
              that Whitburne had played the 'king' of the king ale, and was being rewarded for
              taking on that central role in the celebration. </p>
            <p>The name of 'Whitburne,' who was paid 'for his play,' does not occur elsewhere in the
              churchwardens' accounts, nor in the parish registers, nor in the indexes of wills from
              Hampshire at the Hampshire Record Office. Families named Whitchurch and Wither (or
              Wyther) do appear in the register (75M72/PR1) but since Richard Wither was one of the
              churchwardens in this year, it is unlikely the accounts would misspell Wither as
              'Whitburne.' A Robert 'Whithorne' was buried in the parish on 10 June 1621, but the
              person paid for his play in this year very clearly has a 'b' following the 't.'</p>
            <p> The notation 'p<ex>ai</ex>d' next to most of the rent items on p 50 was obviously
              added later ‚Äì the 'Items' line up under 'ffirst' as the original left margin. The
                'p<ex>ai</ex>d' in the line about John Ale's sheep rent and the note
                'forge<ex>ue</ex>n' in the margin of the following entry are in a fainter ink and
              possibly a different hand than above. The John Primmer line was inserted between
              original lines.</p>

        <div>
          <p>These dictates are copies of dictated lessons contained in a small booklet written by a
            scholar called <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/219137/" type="Person_Commoner">William Badger</rs> between 1563 and 1567. They were mostly
            dictated by the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/17037/" type="Collective_Occupation">schoolmaster</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/218259/" type="Person_Commoner">Christopher Johnson</rs>, but occasionally by the usher, when Johnson was absent
            preparing senior boys for entry to New College, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/73905/" type="Place_F_School">Oxford</rs>. Eight of the 422 dictates in Badger‚Äôs notebook concern dramatic
            performance, some speaking of the drama generally, but others referring specifically to
              <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215119/" type="Drama_Type">performances</rs> at Winchester College. By combining Johnson‚Äôs frequent mentions of
            holidays and other annual events with Badger‚Äôs recording when he enters a new form and
            the beginning of each week of the term, Baldwin was able to determine fairly accurately
            when each dictate was given (<title>Shakspere‚Äôs Small Latine</title>, vol 2, pp 706‚Äì16).
            For more on these records, see ‚Äò<rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215119/" type="Drama_Type">School

            Abigail Ann Young of Records of Early English Drama and Dr Stephen P. Anderson, Head of
            Classics at Winchester College, provided translations and suggested notes for the

                  <ab>When I was annoyed because of those who called a multitude together to the
                    shows and decided one ought to refrain from corporal punishment since they had
                    worked not at all reluctantly, I began to use abuse, full of acrimony and
                    vexation, as is my custom: rather rashly, perhaps, especially among stricken
                    spirits, but I gave full rein to my grief. And so when I had driven them all off
                    with my savage words, I forced them wholly to assume those parts which they had
                    in the comedy, not just on the stage but in life itself and deed, as a way of
                    placating my spirit. Eubulus formed no less sound a plan about his affairs than
                    he gave the day before to Pelargus, his neighbour and friend. Acolastus again
                    goes into exile, who, I fear, may fall among the Pamphagi and Pantalabes. Surely
                    Pelargus, just as unhappy now as previously, finds it hard, I think, to be
                    separated from his son.</ab>

                  <ab>From those stage plays which we have lately exhibited publicly to the view, I
                    think you have derived this benefit besides others, that you have learned
                    yourselves and are also able to teach others ‚Äì if there were need ‚Äì with what
                    expression, with what gestures something should be pronounced. For there should
                    be in the voice a certain amount of elevation, depression, and modulation, in
                    the body decorous movement without prancing around, sometimes more quiet, at
                    others more vehement, with stamping of the feet accommodated to the subject.
                    These I remember I taught, all of which you expressed dexterously enough. It
                    remains that you so remember that if anything hereafter be undertaken in a
                    similar matter neither I shall seem to have lost my labour nor you the fruit of
                    labour.</ab>

                  <ab>The interpreters of Terence and Plautus say a great deal about the origin of
                    comedies and of their nature, disputing not a little so that it may be clear
                    what comedy is. Some wish it to be an imitation of civil life, others wish it to
                    be a representation of the manners which are found in old men, youths,
                    courtesans, pimps, parasites, and others of that kind. From these if it were
                    permitted for me to dissent, I think I could give both a truer and shorter
                    definition of comedy. For what else is comedy than a laborious nothing?
                    Invention difficult, disposition laborious, the description of parts difficult,
                    the training of those who act, if they are a little inept, exasperating, the
                    providing of the curtains well-nigh impossible, the construction of the theatre
                    expensive, the exclusion from the doors not without the offence of many, and the
                    comedy itself nothing. For what is so completely nothing as that which in one
                    moment of the hour, point of time, winking of the eye, both begins to be and
                    ceases?</ab>

                  <ab>When the commander Iphicrates had seen the poultry cocks of Midas' barber
                    attacking those who were Callias' with wings and beak, he turned his mind to
                    military glory. They say that the same thing happened to Themistocles, who when
                    he was leading the army out against the barbarians, saw cocks fighting and,
                    stopping the whole army, he said to them: 'Can it be that these (cocks) are
                    fighting not for their homeland nor for their household gods, nor for liberty,
                    or for children, but only lest one be overcome by the other or one give place to
                    another?' With these words he strengthened the spirits of the Athenians and put
                    the Persians to flight. Thereafter the Athenians made a law that poultry cocks
                    should fight every year in the theatre. Understand that this same practice is
                    only allowed you so that, as no half-hearted onlookers of that fight, you may,
                    each one, earnestly take from it an incentive to courage, along with Iphicrates
                    and the other Athenians.</ab>

                  <ab>The three parts of comedies are reckoned as prothesis, epitasis, and
                    catastrophe. Comedies, moreover, are said to be imitators of people who exist in
                    real life, so let no one doubt that these same divisions occur in real life. You
                    should note also the three time periods in diseases: growth, stasis, and
                    decline. This same thing occurred in the recent holidays, for they had a
                    beginning, a middle, and an end, that you may understand that what Cicero said
                    is true, that nothing ought to seem lasting that will have an end.</ab>

                        and they restore to her husband one who, great with child, swells with dread

                        bed alone. As it is, her practice of fickle desire and her lascivious
                        passion of lost debauchery towards all men produced a miscarriage. Lust has
                        made whatever vice there is in her. If you doubt, Nero, the thing itself
                        shows what is happening: she conceives, after she sees what crime is charged
                        against her without offspring. If you ask where the child comes from, alas

                        the august house of the Caesars, having cast out your own child and true
                        offspring. Who can bear such a great crime? They will give over the reins of

                        But it will be corrected: surely she will not get away with this, by whose
                        unspeakable coition our entire house is polluted, who foists off her
                        bastards on me and intends my empire for her by- blow? Now I see that the
                        child has gained understanding of a depraved mother and learned to renew an
                        ancient shameful act from the illustrious example of her mother: the mother
                        married Silius, she rushes into the mutual embrace of Anicetus. The crime of
                        each is equal and deserves an equal punishment. Will Nero yield in vengeance
                        to her father Claudius? Will he spare the incestuous exile who did not spare
                        his own mother? After so many noble youths and old men, a brother, and a
                        mother had been given over to various deaths, will he so far desist from
                        rage, unmindful of his character and theirs? She will feel my blow. An
                        emperor has not only islands: he has also axes, prisons, hooks, and crosses.
                        This inciter of the mob against my head, adulteress, exile, and barren woman
                        ‚Äì will she nourish my fears besides? Go first of all, I command, and free

                  under Claudius and Poppaea's first husband. According to Tacitus, Octavia, Nero's
                  first wife, was so popular that, when a rumour circulated that Nero was going to
                  bring her back from exile as his wife, the city mob tore down Poppaea's statues.
                  Rubellius Plautus was a cousin of Nero who was descended in the same degree from
                  Augustus whom he had put to death on a charge of treason. Silius was a lover of
                  Octavia's mother, Messalina, with whom she underwent a form of marriage while
                  Claudius was elsewhere. </p>

          <p>The <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215119/" type="Drama_Type">play‚Äôs</rs> connection with <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/106806/" type="Place_F_School">Winchester College</rs> is based on the epilogue‚Äôs reference to the college‚Äôs
            founder, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/87704/" type="Person_Clergy">William Wykeham</rs> (<hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1324‚Äì1404).
            William also founded <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/219573/" type="Place_F_School">New College</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/73905/" type="Place_F_School">Oxford</rs>, but it is more likely that the play was performed at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/79157/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Winchester</rs>, where the records attest to unnamed performances by the scholars
            from the 1560s to the 1590s. Plays appear to have been comparatively rare at New
            College, and no records of performance there exist for the period 1553 to 1603, when
                <title><rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215175/" type="Drama_TitledWork">Pelopidarum secunda</rs></title> must have been performed,
            as the epilogue also mentions <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/11772/" type="Person_Royalty">the
              queen</rs> (for the records of New College, see John R. Elliott, Jr, <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>, <title>Oxford</title>, vol 1, REED (Toronto and Buffalo, 2004). The play
            is also linked to Winchester by the fact that other compositions in verse in Harley MS
            5110 have been attributed to <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/218259/" type="Person_Commoner">Christopher Johnson</rs>, who was <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/17037/" type="Collective_Occupation">headmaster</rs> of Winchester College from 1560 to 1571. We know from his ‚Äò<ref target=" https://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/collections/hamps/appendix-1/">Dictates</ref>,‚Äô recorded by student <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/219137/" type="Person_Commoner">William Badger</rs>, that Johnson promoted play performances by the scholars during
            his tenure.</p>
          <p>The epilogue suggests that the play was not originally written to be performed: it was
            ‚ÄòSomwhat thought on for private exercise/ But never thought for your eares fitt enough.‚Äô
            That the play was performed at least once is clear, though, from the beginning of the
            epilogue, which addresses ‚Äònoble sirs &amp; most kind audience,‚Äô and the ending that
            asks for their approbation. The closing lines mention William Wykeham and twice refer to
            the audience as ‚Äòfounders‚Äô ‚Äî ‚Äòfounders of o<ex>u</ex>r credit‚Äô and ‚Äòfounders of a
            colledge praise‚Äô ‚Äî suggesting that the play was performed as part of the college‚Äôs
            annual Founder‚Äôs Day celebration on 21 December (for the date of Founder‚Äôs Day, see
            Kirby, <title>Annals of Winchester College</title>, pp 155, 310).</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <head>Date and Authorship</head>
          <p>Neither the performance mentioned in the epilogue nor the play text itself can be dated
            very precisely. At top of the first leaf of the MS (f 1) and the first leaf of the play
            (f 27) is the date ‚Äò16 October, 1725‚Äô in a hand much later than those of the texts in
            the MS. This is the date the MS was acquired for the Harley library. The two speeches by
            the queen contained in the MS were delivered in 1592 and 1597, and the copies are in
            secretary hand and made in the 1590s or early 17th century. Of the performances
            mentioned in the college bursars‚Äô accounts, only those for the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/41461/" type="CalendarDay_Liturgical">Christmas season</rs> of 1573/4 mention tragedy ‚Äî‚Äò<ref target=" https://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/records/hamps-ridp243891888/">ludis
                comediar<ex>um</ex> et tragediaru<ex>m</ex></ref>‚Äô ‚Äî while comedy is mentioned
            several times, but performances that do not appear in the accounts were given in other
            years. (If the killing of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215259/" type="Drama_Character">Aerope</rs> is a veiled reference to the killing of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/44850/" type="Person_Royalty">Mary,
              queen of Scots</rs>, the play as we now have it must date after February 1587, but the
            first two scenes could have been added after that date to a play written earlier.) The
            mention of the queen in the play‚Äôs epilogue appears to limit the date of the performance
            to 1553‚Äî1603. The several hands of the play text (including that of the epilogue) are
            also mainly secretary, though with some italic forms, and thus also suggest a date of
            the late-sixteenth to early-seventeenth century.</p>
          <p>Although the manuscript does not carry the name of an author, the epilogue gives the
            impression that it was written by someone connected with the college. The several hands
            of the manuscript may have been those of Winchester scholars, but the text itself does
            not vary so much in style and quality as to suggest that the play was a collaborative
            composition by the boys. It is tempting to attribute the play to Christopher Johnson
              (<hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1536‚Äî97), given his promotion of drama during his tenure as
            headmaster at Winchester College from 1560 to 1571, and the fact that the MS (Harley
            5110) contains other works attributed to him. Johnson was a gifted Latinist, who wrote
            poetry about the school and its founder. His rendering of the pseudo-Homeric
              <title>Batrachomyomachia</title> ('Battle of the Frogs and Mice') into Latin verse was
            much admired on its publication in 1580. The Latin dialogue between Nero and Poppea that
            appears in his ‚Äò<ref target=" https://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/collections/hamps/appendix-1/">Dictates</ref>' may also be Johnson‚Äôs own work. On the other hand, the only
            playwrights mentioned in Johnson‚Äôs ‚ÄòDictates‚Äô are the Roman comic playwrights <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/218462/" type="Person_Male">Terence</rs> and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/218515/" type="Person_Male">Plautus</rs>, and nothing resembling the <title>Pelopidarum</title>
            is mentioned there, nor is there evidence of Johnson producing original works in
            English.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <head>The Play</head>
          <p><title>Pelopidarum secunda</title> is a verse tragedy in English that tells the
            familiar story of Agamemnon‚Äôs murder by his wife, Clytemnestra, and her lover Aegisthus,
            who are in turn killed in revenge by Orestes and his sister Electra. The Latin title is
            ambiguous. Martin Wiggins suggests the name might mean that there was a
              <title>Pelopidarum prima</title>, ‚Äòpresumably centring on Thyestes and perhaps taking
            the story as far as Iphigenia? The Atreus/Aeropa sequence in the early scenes certainly
            appears extraneous to this play‚Äôs main focus, and could be a hangover from a lost first
            part. However, ‚Äúsecunda‚Äù might alternatively refer to the second generation of
            Pelopidae‚Äô (<title>British Drama</title>, vol 3: <title>1590‚Äì1597</title>, p 1).</p>
          <p>The play has a total of 3,465 lines, including the fifty-line epilogue (but excluding
            stage directions). The dialogue scenes are in iambic pentameter, mostly blank verse,
            while the choruses use lines varying from as few as two stresses to as many as six, some
            of which rhyme in couplets. The choruses occasionally use unison speaking, but more
            often are composed of a series of individual speeches by four or five characters who
            play no other part in the action.</p>
          <p>The play has the large cast typical of academic drama: thirty-six speaking parts, as
            well as a number of non-speaking attendants. The two main women have the longest parts
            in the play: Clytemnestra has 476 lines, Electra 436. Orestes has the longest part of
            the men at 354 lines, followed distantly by Eurysthenes with 225 lines and Aegisthus
            with 190. (The idea that the title, <title>Pelopidarum secunda</title>, refers to the
            second generation of Pelops‚Äô descendants is undercut by the fact that the second
            generation is represented by Aegisthus (Thyestes‚Äô son) and Agamemnon (Atreus‚Äô son), and
            Aegisthus‚Äô part is only the fifth largest and Agamemon‚Äôs the tenth largest, at only
            ninety lines.)</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <head>Sources</head>
          <p><title>Pelopidarum</title> is based on two classical sources, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/219199/" type="Person_Male">Seneca</rs>‚Äôs <title><rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/219258/" type="Drama_TitledWork">Agamemnon</rs></title> and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/219285/" type="Person_Male">Sophocles</rs>‚Äô <title><rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/219320/" type="Drama_TitledWork">Electra</rs></title>, but it adapts rather than merely
            translating those works. Some scenes follow the sources closely, while others are much
            expanded or condensed. Atreus‚Äô trick to get Clytemnestra and Agathia to strangle Aerope
            in the second scene appears to be invented by the author and if partly in the spirit of
            Seneca is closer to the horrific violence of <title>The Spanish Tragedy</title> or
              <title>The Revenger‚Äôs Tragedy</title>.</p>
          <p>Another brief section that does not occur in either source does appear in other
            classical sources and has been considerably displaced chronologically from its ancient
            place in the story. The <title>Pelopidarum</title> places the killing of Atreus by
            Aegisthus between Agamemnon‚Äôs return from Troy and his murder by Aegisthus and
            Clytemnestra. The ancient sources say that Aegisthus killed Atreus much earlier, before
            Aegisthus and his father Thyestes expelled Agamemnon and Menelaus from Mycenae and ruled
            there as joint kings. Only later did Agamemnon recover the throne of Mycenae, lead the
            Greek expedition to Troy, and return after ten more years to be murdered. The killing of
            Atreus is dramatically ineffective when placed where it is, since it intrudes on the
            audience‚Äôs anticipation of the killing of Agamemnon. Perhaps the author meant to
            emphasize the theme of the inevitable punishment of evil actions, by having Aegisthus
            take revenge on both father (Atreus) and son (Agamemnon) in successive scenes.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <head>Synopsis</head>

          <p>The play‚Äôs first two scenes have no counterpart in Seneca‚Äôs <title>Agamemnon</title>.
            1.1 is a soliloquy by <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215193/" type="Drama_Character">Hipparchus</rs>, who explains that <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215215/" type="Drama_Character">Atreus</rs> is haunted by the ghost of his brother <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215237/" type="Drama_Character">Thyestes</rs>, and furious over the unfaithfulness of his wife, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215259/" type="Drama_Character">Aerope</rs>, with his brother. Atreus aims to get revenge on Aerope by means of the
            trick that forms the following scene. In 1.2 Atreus tells <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215281/" type="Drama_Character">Clytemnestra</rs> and her maid <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215303/" type="Drama_Character">Agathia</rs> that a witch named <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215325/" type="Drama_Character">Dipsas</rs> is keeping Thyestes‚Äô ghost from rest, and asks their help in
            interrogating her. When he brings the witch in it is actually Aerope with her face
            covered. Atreus ties a cord around Aerope‚Äôs forehead and gives the two ends to
            Clytemnestra and Agathia to pull on, in order to torture the witch into confessing.
            Before they pull, however, Atreus suggests the women avert their eyes. He then pulls the
            cord down to Aerope‚Äôs neck, and when the two women pull, they strangle Aerope. Atreus
            exults, the women wail, and Agathia suicides. Clytemnestra grabs the knife to kill
            herself, but drops it when the ghost of Thyestes appears. (Classicist David Lupher,
            University of Puget Sound, has confirmed to the editors in an email that there is no
            classical source for this episode. In fact, no ancient source tells how Aerope
            died.)</p>

          <p>1.3 involves Thyestes‚Äô ghost giving what is the prologue of Seneca‚Äôs
              <title>Agamemnon</title>, and his speech sticks fairly closely to Seneca, though it
            explicitly names figures (Ixion, Sisyphus, etc) that in Seneca are identified only by
            their well-known punishments. Seneca‚Äôs chorus at this point is left out, but the next
            scene (1.4) follows the source, as Clytemnestra tells her women of her love of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215347/" type="Drama_Character">Aegisthus</rs> and hatred of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215369/" type="Drama_Character">Agamemnon</rs>, and Aegisthus enters to argue with her over the plot to murder
            Agamemnon. The chorus that closes Act 1 has no counterpart in Seneca. The
              <title>Pelopidarum</title> chorus recalls the murder of Aerope, linking it to
            Clytemnestra‚Äôs intent to kill Agamemnon.</p>

          <p>The first part of Act 2 is based on Seneca‚Äôs Act 3, and begins with Clytemnestra solo,
            before <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215391/" type="Drama_Character">Eurybates</rs> arrives to announce Agamemnon‚Äôs imminent arrival
            and relate the travails the returning Greeks have suffered on the seas. Eurybates is
            followed by captive Trojan women, who tell of their suffering. Agamemnon arrives home in
            a scene misnumbered as Act 4 (probably because the play has reached Act 4 of its
            source). He exults, gives brief thanks to the gods at altar, is warned by <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215413/" type="Drama_Character">Cassandra</rs>, and goes into the palace. Then comes a short scene with no analogue
            in Seneca, in which Atreus enters to pray at the altar, but is killed by Aegisthus, who
            has sneaked in behind him. Cassandra has a long solo speech describing Agamemnon‚Äôs going
            to bed, and the scene then shifts to his bedroom, with a brief dialogue about putting on
            a shirt given him by Clytemnestra. Clytemnestra and Aegisthus enter and kill Agamemnon
            with a single stab by Aegisthus. The murder is handled very differently from Seneca,
            where Aegisthus is portrayed as weak, and Clytemnestra has to take the axe from him to
            hew off Agamemnon‚Äôs head. The chorus that ends Act 2 retells the action, including the
            killing of Atreus, but adds no particular commentary on the events.</p>

          <p>The story of spiriting Orestes away, from the end of the Seneca, is left out, and Act 3
            begins with the first episode of Sophocles‚Äô <title>Electra</title>, as <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215435/" type="Drama_Character">Electra</rs> complains of her fate to a group of women supporters (named individuals
            taking the place of Sophocles‚Äô chorus). <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215457/" type="Drama_Character">Chrysothenis</rs> enters to debate the situation with Electra, the dialogue closely
            paralleling the one in Sophocles. Then comes a short scene not in Sophocles, in which
              <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215479/" type="Drama_Character">Strophius</rs> reassures Electra that he has kept Orestes safe. Electra and
            Clytemnesta argue about the killing of Agamemnon in a condensed version of the Sophocles
            scene. Clytemnestra wants to kill Electra but Aegisthus (who is not an onstage character
            in Sophocles) says that since Electra desires death, it will punish her more severely to
            imprison her instead. Then Cassandra (likewise not in Sophocles) is condemned by
            Clytemnestra and Aegisthus, and they kill her offstage. (This scenelet lessens the
            impact of the punishment of Electra). A chorus of the captive women laments Cassandra‚Äôs
            death. A chorus (labelled Act 4 but in fact the end of Act 3) does not follow Sophocles‚Äô
            chorus at all, but does generalize in suggesting that the events are all the gods‚Äô
            will.</p>

          <p>Act 4 (mislabelled Act 5, Scene 1) begins with <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215501/" type="Drama_Character">Euristhenes</rs> (called Pedagogus in Sophocles) reminding <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215523/" type="Drama_Character">Orestes</rs> how Euristhenes saved him and brought him up. Orestes tells Euristhenes
            to go to Electra and say Orestes is dead, while he deals with Clytemnestra and
            Aegisthus. However, in a scene not in the source, Orestes hesitates and engages in
            dialogue with <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215545/" type="Drama_Character">Pilades</rs> about their mutual support and love. A new scene
            finds Clytemnestra expressing her fears of her children, while Aegisthus tries to
            comfort her. He leaves and she has a brief outburst of passion but soothes herself by
            calling for a song, the only music indicated in the play. The rest of the act follows
            Sophocles, as Euristhenes tells Clytemnestra and Electra a story about Orestes‚Äô death in
            a chariot race at the Pythian Games. Electra remains and is joined by Chrysothenis, who
            believes the offerings at their father‚Äôs tomb indicate that Orestes is alive and has
            returned. Electra responds with Euristhenes‚Äô news of Orestes‚Äô death and urges
            Chrysothenis to join her in killing Aegisthus and Clytemnestra, but Chrysothenis
            refuses. The chorus that ends Act 4 basically recaps the action of the act, but is
            distinctive in form, with stage directions that indicate that the chorus first speaks at
            the east, then the west, and finally in the midst, apparently imitating the classical
            choral structure of strophe, antistrophe, and epode.</p>

          <p>Act 5 begins with a scene not in Sophocles, in which Euristhenes urges Orestes not to
            spare his mother. Pilades agrees, reminding Orestes of Apollo‚Äôs oracles that commanded
            he kill both his father‚Äôs murderers. Orestes still resists killing his mother, and feels
            either course will be impiety, but eventually the other two convince him. When Electra
            enters Orestes pretends to be a stranger bringing Orestes‚Äôs ashes, then reveals himself
            by showing her Agamemnon‚Äôs ring. </p>

          <p>The next section follows Sophocles fairly closely. The two siblings then work each
            other up to the killing of their mother in a lengthy exchange of single lines.
            Clytemnestra enters and pleads for her life, but Orestes is now determined and kills
            her. Aegisthus is then tricked by Orestes‚Äô bringing out Clytemnestra‚Äôs body and saying
            it is Orestes‚Äôs, making Aegisthus look beneath the cover. Orestes reveals his true
            identity and kills Aegisthus. (The killing takes place on stage, unlike in its Greek
            source.) Sophocles‚Äô <title>Electra</title> then ends rapidly with short speeches by
            Orestes and the chorus that claim justice has been done. But in
              <title>Pelopidarum</title> Orestes is immediately wracked by guilt and beset by ghosts
            ‚Äî of Clytemnestra and Aegisthus, but also of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215567/" type="Drama_Character">Tesiphone</rs> and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/215589/" type="Drama_Character">Cerberus</rs>. Although Orestes is tormented by ghosts rather
            than the Furies, the playwright here seems to be paralleling Aeschylus‚Äô version of the
            story.</p>

          <p>The final chorus is the only one to really comment on the events, recapping the events
            and characters of the play, as the earlier choruses do, but also repeating the lines
            ‚ÄòEarthe vnawares consenteth to the skyes‚Äô and ‚Äògod<ex>es</ex> will have offenders
            blinde.‚Äô The ending thus emphasizes the human inability to foresee the future or grasp
            the big picture. Orestes‚Äô matricide is not called justice, as it is in Sophocles, but
            misguided, and the chorus argues that all Greece</p>

          <quote><p>may iustly repent thy iust revenginge.<lb/> Thus we wishe for a thinge, to loath
              it after:<lb/> first we slaughter a kinge, then hate the slaughter:<lb/> pull
              Authoritie downe to gayne a madd man,<lb/> better twere for a crowne retayne a badd
              man.<lb/> Doe not move a disease the force alayed,<lb/> And disturbe not a peace the
              cyttie stayed.<lb/> Crownes are frayle, nor a bide the safe removinge</p></quote>

          <p>This chorus thus moves the play from academic classicism to commentary on English
            politics. Like <title>Gorboduc</title>, <title>Pelopidarum secunda</title> shows the
            explosion of violence and bloodshed that killing the king sets in motion. It could be
            applicable to almost any time during Elizabeth‚Äôs reign, but if it were associated with
            Christopher Johnson‚Äôs mastership in the 1560s, it would speak to those upset with the
            recently crowned Elizabeth, especially in the area around Winchester, where resistance
            to Protestantism was strong.</p>

          <p>Another intriguing possibility is that the invented scene of the killing of Aerope
            might be a veiled reference to Elizabeth‚Äôs part in the killing of Mary, queen of Scots.
            Though suggesting a parallel between Elizabeth and Clytemnestra might seem a dangerous
            move by the playwright, he depicts Clytemnestra as distressed at her part in killing a
            kinswoman, and absolves her of guilt by showing that she was tricked into complicity by
            the deceitful Atreus.</p>

          <p>Whether or not the play intended to comment on recent events, it appears to belong to
            the fashion for revenge tragedy, which would date it closer to the end of Elizabeth‚Äôs
            reign than the beginning. Though the author can hardly match Marlowe or Shakespeare as a
            poet, one may hear faint echoes or anticipations in lines like Storge‚Äôs ‚ÄòBringinge the
            Captiue dames of Phrygia,' which suggests Tamburlaine‚Äôs ‚ÄòHolla, ye pamper‚Äôd Jades of
              <title>Asia</title>‚Äô (<title>Tamburlaine the Great, Part 2</title>, <title>The
              Complete Works of Christopher Marlowe</title>, David Fuller and Edward J. Esche (eds),
            vol 5 (Oxford, 1998), 4.3.1). The play‚Äôs reflections on the cost, both social and
            personal, of pursuing revenge serve to emphasize Shakespeare‚Äôs much greater achievement
            in <title>Hamlet</title>.</p>

          <p>In addition to the play, the volume contains two Latin speeches by Queen Elizabeth, one
            to the heads of Oxford University and another rebuking the Polish Ambassador, as well as
            copies of Donne‚Äôs Satires I ‚Äî III, the arguments of the Psalms in verse, and a
            paraphrase of the Proverbs of Solomon in couplets.</p>

          <p>The hands of different copyists divide the play text into seventeen sections. The
            speech headings and stage directions appear to have been added by two different hands (I
            and II), in either black (B) or red (R) ink, and generally in an italic script intended
            to contrast with the secretary used for the spoken parts. The modern pencil foliation is
            continuous through the manuscript, while the original ink foliation is intermittent.
            Some folios also carry cancelled ink foliation (in parentheses below).</p>

          <p>*The ink foliation skips over pencil f 54.</p>

          <p>The two longest sections (13 and 16) appear to be by the same hand, and are written
            neatly with few corrections. Section 13a may have been added by the same writer as the
            stage directions designated by ‚ÄòI,‚Äô but all the other sections seem to be by different
            hands. This large number of different hands, many of them copying only one or two
            folios, suggests that the scholars were employed as copyists, with a supervising master
            or two organizing the project and providing the stage directions. Why this was done ‚Äî
            whether as a classroom exercise or in order to create additional copies of the play ‚Äî
            cannot be discerned.</p>

          <p>The manuscript has been repaired so that each leaf is glued to a modern stub leaf
            attached to the binding, which prevents us from learning anything from how the leaves
            were gathered. The uncancelled ink foliation of sections 13 and 16 accurately continues
            the cancelled ink foliation of sections 2, 5, and 6, suggesting that other copies of the
            intervening sections existed at some time. The uncancelled ink foliation of sections
            2‚Äî10 indicate an attempt to foliate the play by itself (apart from any texts on
            preceding leaves) and probably represent a somewhat later stage of the manuscript, with
            the current sections 3, 4, and 7 to 10 replacing earlier copies of those parts of the
            play. Whether sections 11 to 17 were all included in an earlier stage of the manuscript
            cannot be determined, since the ink foliation was abandoned after section 10. The
            epilogue seems to have been added at the end of section 16 after the rest was complete,
            though not much later, as the hand is similar in date to those in the rest of the
            manuscript.</p>

          <p>One can only conjecture how the manuscript may have come to take its present form. One
            possibility is that sections 13 and 16 are the oldest, the work either of the playwright
            himself or a professional copyist. Then a number of the Winchester College scholars may
            have been given the task of copying parts of the play, and their work substituted for
            the original folios containing those sections. A second possibility is that two or more
            complete copies of the play existed around 1600, and someone later created the current
            composite manuscript, perhaps choosing the sections that were in the best condition.</p>

                            especially apt in this context. Ceyx was king of Trachis and the couple
                            were both beautiful and very much in love. They took to referring to
                            themselves as Zeus and Hera, which angered the gods. When Ceyx was
                            traveling by ship to consult the oracle of Apollo, Zeus hit the ship
                            with a thunderbolt and Ceyx was drowned. Alcyone threw herself into the
                            sea in grief, but the gods were so impressed by the intensity of the
                            couple's love that Zeus transformed them into kingfishers (halcyon
                            birds). This allusion, and those to Procne and Philomela, are taken from
                            Seneca.</hi></note></cell>

                            here, as there is no speech heading for the first two lines. If they are

                            appear necessary to lead to Laucothea's following speech. The stage

            stories concerning early dramatic and musical activity in <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/79157/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Winchester</rs>, many of which have been repeated by later scholars (see, for
            example, Chambers, <title>Medieval Stage</title>, vol 1, pp 56, 361). A number of these
            that concern the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/21537/" type="Drama_Character">boy bishop</rs> at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/106806/" type="Place_F_School">Winchester College</rs> come from manuscripts that survive in the College Archives
            and are among the records from the college included in this collection. Unfortunately,
            the sources that Warton cites for some of his most interesting stories cannot now be
            found and may, in fact, have never existed. Certainly the suspect records give the
            initial appearance of being genuine. Warton gives likely sounding names for his
            manuscript sources, though not always where he found the manuscripts. He frequently
            gives what purport to be the original texts of the records, in Latin. The records thus
            appear to be too precise and detailed to be fabrications. However, scholars have found
            evidence that Warton did indeed engage in elaborate fabrication. H.E.D. Blakiston has
            carefully analyzed Warton‚Äôs quotations from Machyn‚Äôs Diary (BL: Cotton Vitellius F. 5)
            in the <title>History of English Poetry</title> and <title>The Life of Sir Thomas Pope,
              Founder of Trinity College Oxford</title>, 2nd ed (London, 1780) (‚ÄòThomas Warton and
            Machyn‚Äôs Diary,‚Äô English Historical Review 11, no 42 (April 1896), 282‚Äì300). Some of the
            passages quoted by Warton have indeed been transcribed from Machyn‚Äôs Diary, though
            Warton‚Äôs transcriptions show minor inaccuracies. But one lengthy passage, which
            describes the entertainments Sir Thomas Pope provided for Princess Elizabeth at Hatfield
            during Shrovetide 1556/7, including a play of Holofernes, does not appear anywhere in
            the extant manuscript of Machyn‚Äôs Diary. Warton offers a lengthy and complicated
            explanation, stating that because the manuscript had been badly damaged in the fire in
            Cotton‚Äôs library, he had to work from a transcript of the diary made by John Strype
            before the fire. Blakiston, however, argues that the manuscript was not damaged nearly
            as badly as Warton suggests, and further points out that the section of Machyn‚Äôs Diary
            covering Shrovetide 1556/7, when the play and other entertainments for Princess
            Elizabeth supposedly took place, is not damaged and ‚Äòthe entries from 26 Feb. to 18
            March are continuous on a single leaf of the manuscript‚Äô (Blakiston, ‚ÄòThomas Warton,‚Äô pp
            289, 293‚Äì4, 297‚Äì9; my own examination of Machyn‚Äôs Diary confirms Blakiston‚Äôs
            observations).</p>
          <p>The evidence that the Hampshire records in this appendix are fabrications is less
            certain than Blakiston‚Äôs evidence concerning the passages supposedly taken from Machyn‚Äôs
            Diary. Warton often visited his brother <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/219468/" type="Person_Clergy">Joseph</rs>, headmaster of Winchester College, which gave him ready access to the
            college documents he used. He could well have used other Winchester documents, such as
            the Winchester diocesan records held by the bishop, and of course some of those
            documents might have been lost or destroyed in the two-and-half centuries since Warton
            wrote. What makes the records suspect is the very detail that makes them so attractive.
            Most records are laconic and matter of fact; scribes of official documents recorded only
            as much detail as was necessary for the purpose of the document. The records Warton
            quotes from surviving documents fit that pattern: records concerning the boy bishops at
            Winchester College include a payment in the bursar‚Äôs accounts for the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/41365/" type="CalendarDay_Liturgical">feast of the Holy Innocents</rs> 1405 ‚Äì ‚Äòdat<ex>is</ex>
            per Epis<ex>copu</ex>m pu<ex>er</ex>or<ex>um</ex> ij s. viij d.‚Äô ‚Äì and an entry in a
            1432 college inventory for a cross on a staff for the boy bishop ‚Äì ‚ÄòIt<ex>e</ex>m alia

              Ep<ex>iscop</ex>o in die innocent<ex>ium</ex>‚Äô (see <ref target="https://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/records/hamps-ridp241492592/">Winchester

              College Inventory, 1432</ref>).</p>
          <p>The suspect records, in stark contrast, are so detailed as to be almost chatty,
            offering a wealth of the sort of information we would most like to know about what was
            performed, how, and by whom. But we find such information only rarely, and then in
            personal letters or journals, not in official records of the kind Warton claimed were
            his sources. Such documents might occasionally tell us a minstrel‚Äôs name, but not the
            subjects of what he sung, nor where he did it (which would have been obvious, and thus
            of little interest to the clerk doing the recording). So one reads with initial
            excitement, but also a good deal of suspicion, a record that tells us that in 1338 a
            minstrel named Herbert sang of the Danish giant, Colbrond, and also of Queen Emma (both
            local Winchester stories) in the prior‚Äôs hall. Or that two different groups of boy
            choristers dressed up like girls to perform in the refectory for the nuns of St Mary‚Äôs
            Abbey in 1441. The first of these records supposedly came from a register of the priors
            of St Swithun‚Äôs (a source Warton gives for several of the suspect records), the second
            from an account roll, neither of them documents in which we would expect to find
            unnecessary details (<title>History of English Poetry</title>, vol 1, p 89; vol 3, pp
            323‚Äì5).</p>
          <p>In his ‚ÄòPreface,‚Äô Warton argues that ‚Äòa history of poetry ... must be more especially
            productive of entertainment and utility,‚Äô and ‚Äòanecdotes of the rudiments of a favourite
            art will always be particularly pleasing‚Äô (<title>History of English Poetry</title>, pp
            ii‚Äìiii). His aim, he says, was to construct his history as a continuous narrative: ‚ÄòI
            have chose to exhibit the history of our poetry in a chronological series: not
            distributing my matter into detached articles, of periodical divisions, or of general
            heads‚Äô (p iii). He asks readers‚Äô indulgence for the fact that ‚Äòthe citations in the
            first volume are numerous, and sometimes very prolix. But it should be remembered, that
            most of these are extracted from antient manuscript poems never before printed, and
            hitherto but little known. Nor was it easy to illustrate the darker and more distant
            periods of our poetry, without producing ample specimens‚Äô (p viii). We can perhaps grasp
            here the motivation for inventing specimens to fill gaps in the narrative when few
            documents have survived and those that have are frustratingly uninformative in their
            terseness. Certainly his extensive research in manuscript sources and his training in
            Latin gave him the skills he needed to create records and manuscript references that
