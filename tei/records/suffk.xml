    <head>Acknowledgements</head>
    <div>
     <p>When work on a collection such as this one extends over so long a period of time (begun in
      2004), writing acknowledgments becomes not only an extensive series of 'thank you's' for
      assistance given, but an archaeological dig of sorts. A generation of splendid archivists and
      librarians that was once there has largely retired from the scene, giving way to a new one;
      some archives have been given new names, affiliations and institutional expectations (even new
      shelf marks for many materials); and this book is being published in a form unimaginable for
      it when work began in 2004. Yet amongst the comings and goings of time's children, the miracle
      that is REED continues to thrive.</p>

     <p>My acknowledgments must rightly begin with the two towering figures in REED's pantheon. The
      first is REED's legendary Founder (and now Senior Consultant), Professor Emerita Alexandra F.
      Johnson, who (with REED's Board) accepted me into the REED orbit as a fledgling editor in
      1980, and kept a careful guiding eye during my first lengthy on-site research trip that same
      year. Without her there would be no REED, of course, and for me personally there would have
      been no career doing the work that I love.</p>

     <p>The second is Professor Sally-Beth Maclean, Director of Research and General Editor of the
      REED Project, who, in 1982 became the face of REED (and many times thereafter its saviour)
      when Sandy took on her heavy responsibilities as Principal of Victoria College, University of
      Toronto, before returning to REED. On a personal note, Sally-Beth has been the guiding
      presence that helped bring my own three REED collections through to completion.</p>

     <p>REED has always been characterized by its collaborative spirit and team approach to
      scholarship. So, thanks, and admiration, must first go to the REED editorial team for its very
      considerable contributions to the production of this collection: to Sally-Beth MacLean and
      Professor John Craig (Simon Fraser University), Chair of the REED Executive Board, for their
      essential advice in the shaping of the Introduction; to Tanya Hagen, Managing Editor, and
      Chief Editor of EMLoT (Early Modern London Theatres) for her oversight and team guidance; to
      Patrick Gregory, Associate Editor, Latinist, Palaeographer, Glossarian, and possessor of what
      could only be described as a gift for unknotting editorial and linguistic perplexities; to
      Illya Nokhrin, Research Associate, Lead Digital Indexer; and to Peter Greenfield (University
      of Puget Sound), member of the REED Executive Board, English Palaeographer for the volume, and
      fellow REED editor, for his selfless contributions during production. No less essential and
      substantive have been the contributions of four talented research assistants on the editorial
      team: Alexandra Atiya (Centre for Medieval Studies), Bibliographer, Latin Glossarian, and
      Latin Checker; Morgan Moore (Centre for Medieval Studies), Content Checker; Andrew Wiebe
      (Faculty of Information), Mapping and Locations Indexer; and Laina Southgate (Department of
      English), Assistant Indexer.</p>

     <p>Other REED associates who deserve special thanks for their skills and contributions include
      Stephanie Hovland, Stuart Palmer, Matthew Payne, Alan H. Nelson, and Peter Greenfield, who
      variously conducted invaluable on-site checking of manuscripts and documents at The National
      Archives, the British Library, Oxford University, Cambridge Univerity, Norfolk Record Office,
      and Suffolk Record Offices at Bury St Edmunds and Ipswich. Without that crucial work, often
      done with deadlines looming, timely publication of the collection to REED standards would not
      have been possible.</p>

     <p>Looking further afield, when I sought help in gathering names of staff to acknowledge at the
      three branches of the Suffolk Record Office, the senior archivist to whom I spoke declined to
      single them out, saying that they worked as a team and preferred to be acknowledged in that
      way. I can thus only offer my thanks and admiration to the great many unnamed archivists who
      assisted me at Suffolk Record Office Ipswich, Bury St Edmunds, and Lowestoft. But I can more
      properly acknowledge other persons, in Suffolk and beyond, who generously facilitated and
      contributed to the work on this volume. The late David Dymond, Vice-President of the Suffolk
      Institute of Archaeology and History, President of Suffolk Record Society, and Vice-President
      of the British Association for Local History was rightly described by Mark Bailey of the
      Institute as ‘Suffolk’s greatest historian.’ He had a special interest in REED and
      enthusiastically responded to my every question, especially those having to do with the
      Suffolk glebe. Sue Andrews, Honorary Archivist at Hadleigh Archives and a respected local
      historian, made documents accessible and identified a document containing performance content
      that would not otherwise have made its way into the collection. Anthony Breen, Bury historian,
      shared useful information concerning Abbey tenements in Bury which the Sacrist had rented to
      secular entertainers in the town. Local historian David Lindley, of Beccles and District
      Museum (now retired), generously shared his considerable collection (some 23 pages) of
      carefully researched materials concerning the Beccles game place, which he had mined from the
      Rix Collection (now archived at SRO Ipswich). Catherine Howard-Dobson, Lead Curator for
      Aldeburgh Museum, and a Town Councillor of Aldeburgh, most generously shared her knowledge of
      early performance in that town. My thanks as well to Paul R. Dryburgh, Medieval Records
      Specialist, Advice &amp; Records Knowledge Department of the National Archives, and Richard W.
      Barber, founder of The Boydell Press and a noted medieval historian, for their assistance with
      records of Edward the Black Prince, and the early tournament tradition in Suffolk. Finally,
      Northamptonshire Record Office supplied a copy and document description of a letter containing
      references to Christmas games written by John Chamberlain to Sir Ralph Winwood on 13 January
      1609, for which I am most appreciative.</p>

     <p>I gratefully acknowledge permissions to publish transcriptions of extracts from among their
      holdings that were given by numerous archives and libraries, including: the National Archives,
      Kew; The British Library, London; The Bodleian Library, Oxford; Cambridge University Library;
      Suffolk Record Office (SRO) Lowestoft; SRO Bury St. Edmunds; SRO Ipswich; Northamptonshire
      Record Office; University of Chicago Library, Special Collections Research Center, notably
      (for their splendid assistance), Julia Gardner (Head of Reader Services at the Center) and
      Christine Colburn for facilitating the obtaining of photographs; and, finally, The Society of
      Antiquaries, London, for providing access to study household account books of the Duke of
      Norfolk.</p>

     <p>Finally (but incalculably significantly in their impact on the collection), I received
      support in the form of grants, fellowships and awards from a number of sources that enabled me
      to do on-site research, and to have the time and several settings in which to make the results
      of that research ready for publication). For all that support, I am endebted beyond measure.
      This patronage (to use a REED term) includes: a fellowship from the National Endowment for the
      Humanities; a travel grant from the American Philosophical Society; a Friends of the
      UW-Madison Libraries Grant-in-Aid; two UW-System fellowships, plus an additional Honorary
      Fellowship at the Institute for Research in the Humanities, UW-Madison; two sabbaticals from
      University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point (UWSP); seven research grants from UWSP; a number of
      recognitions from UWSP that enabled on-site research to continue; and finally, the consistent
      support for multi-year research by the UWSP Chair of English, the successive Deans of the UWSP
      College of Letters and Science, and the numerous colleagues who comprised the UWSP Personnel
      Development Committee. Words cannot suffice. . . . </p>

     <p>I must always thank my teacher, mentor and true friend, the late John Wasson, Washington
      State University professor, and pioneering REED editor for his uniquely generous introduction
      to the magical world of documentary research.</p>

     <p>Lastly (but firstly), with love, to my wife and fellow explorer Bobbie.</p>

    <head>Historical Background</head>
    <div>
     <p>The county of <rs ref="eats:2273" type="Place_County">Suffolk</rs> lies sixty miles north of
      London. Together with Norfolk it forms the heart of East Anglia, a region that, culturally and
      geographically, also includes Essex and parts of Cambridgeshire. Anciently described as 'a
      maritime county,' Suffolk borders the North Sea to the east. To the north, the rivers Little
      Ouse and the Waveney form the border between Suffolk and Norfolk; to the west, The Devil's
      Ditch (an ancient seven and a half mile ditch and rampart) form the border with
      Cambridgeshire; and to the south, the River Stour separates Suffolk from Essex.<note
       type="foot">Gordon Blackwood, <title>Tudor and Stuart Suffolk</title> (Lancaster, 2001), 1–2;
       David Dymond and Peter Northeast, <title>A History of Suffolk</title> (Chichester, 1995),
       31.</note> On its surface, Suffolk is deceptively modest and simple. As Suffolk historian
      Mark Bailey puts it, to the eye of a visitor, it 'might appear to be a pleasant, but
      undistinguished, backwater.'<note type="foot">Mark Bailey, <title>Medieval Suffolk</title>
       (Woodbridge, 2007), 1.</note> Even its gentle topography lacks severe extremes. Yet Suffolk
      has made contributions of central, national, and lasting importance at every point in English
      history. Even its performance traditions and its sophisticated culture are of a magnitude out
      of proportion to Suffolk's by-way location and its unassuming ways. The facts of Suffolk's
      history offer useful insights into the reasons for the richness of that performative
      heritage.</p>

     <p>One key to situating Suffolk's unique cultural heritage within its immediate surroundings is
      to notice the interdependent relationship among Suffolk's soil regions, rivers, and
      transportation systems, and their contribution to the essential mobility that is a
      characteristic feature of early Suffolk. The first of these three topographical features,
      Suffolk's landscape, is composed of four regions, viewed west to east. In the far northwest
      lie the Fens and the Breckland, sandy soils once suitable mainly for sheep-raising and rabbit
      warrens. The centre two-thirds of the county, High Suffolk and Woodlands, generally the
      highest land in the county, is composed of boulder-clay, and occupied with agricultural
      production amidst substantial villages and isolated churches. The northern part of High
      Suffolk is flat and interfluvial (meaning that it is an area between adjacent streams that
      flow in the same direction, in this case, toward the east and the sea). Once dominated by
      hedgerows and small farms, High Suffolk now has many large, unbroken, fields. In the way that
      they preserve 'two millenia or more of planning and replanning, expansion and contraction, and
      piecemeal alteration,' the fields and minor routeways of High Suffolk are, in the words of
      landscape historian, Tom Williamson, 'a rich historical document' of the greatest value. In
      the southern part of High Suffolk, known as the Woodlands, the land is more compact and
      dissected by streams. The central region was particularly known for its production of butter
      and cheese. At Suffolk's eastern edge, stretching the entire length of the county is the
      coastal Sandlings, composed of alluvial soils and suitable mainly for sheep and corn.<note
       type="foot">Blackwood, <title>Tudor and Stuart Suffolk</title>, pp 2–3; John Wymer, 'Surface
       Geology,' in David Dymond and Edward Martin (eds), <title>An Historical Atlas of
        Suffolk</title>, 3rd ed (Ipswich, 1999), 18; Edward Martin, 'Soil Regions,' in Dymond and
       Martin, <title>Historical Atlas</title>, pp 20–21; Tom Williamson, 'Ancient Landscapes,' in
       Dymond and Martin, <title>Historical Atlas</title>, pp 48–49.</note> Suffolk's considerable
      dramatic records come from communities located in all four of these geographical regions.</p>

     <p>The retreating glacial age that created Suffolk's 'gently undulating countryside' also
      created the county's signature river valleys. As John Wymer explains, melt-waters from the
      receding glaciers drained east and southeast creating the wide and shallow valleys associated
      with the Rivers Waveney, Deben, Gipping, and Stour. Suffolk has four other, lesser, rivers as
      well: Lark, Little Ouse, Blyth, and Alde, plus innumerable smaller waterways. All but two of
      those eight major rivers flow west to east, providing 'ready-made highways.' They and other of
      Suffolk's waterways had quays, jetties, rudimentary cranes, bridges, and ferries built and
      operated along them. Rivers and creeks emptied into the North Sea at one or another of
      Suffolk's seven larger ports (Aldeburgh, Dunwich, Ipswich, Lowestoft, Orford, Southwold, and
      Woodbridge). Using them, early Suffolk engaged in massive coastal shipping (from Newcastle to
      London), major commerce with the midlands, and considerable traffic with Iceland, and
      continental Europe. This sophisticated system of water-transport, complementing its roadways,
      made Suffolk 'one of the most commercialized areas in medieval England.'<note type="foot"

       Suffolk,' in Dymond and Martin, <title>Historical Atlas</title>, p 14; Alistair Robertson,

        Atlas</title>, pp 132–3.</note></p>

     <p>The third of these interdependent elements—Suffolk's major and minor or local road
      systems—offers further potential insights into the county's performance traditions. Early maps
      indicate one major north-south road as going from London to Chelmsford, Essex. At that point
      this main road diverged into two roads that both made their way through Suffolk. The first of
      them (a coastal branch) went from Chelmsford to <rs ref="eats:372911"
       type="Place_PA_Settlement">Colchester</rs> (Essex) to <rs ref="eats:369522"
       type="Place_PA_Settlement">Ipswich</rs>, <rs ref="eats:366764" type="Place_PA_Settlement"
       >Aldeburgh</rs>, and <rs ref="eats:373969" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Dunwich</rs>, branching
      at Dunwich either to Yarmouth in Norfolk or to Norwich. The second branch went from
      Chelmsford, Essex, to <rs ref="eats:366577" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Sudbury</rs> and <rs
       ref="eats:313077" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Bury St Edmunds</rs>, to Thetford, Norfolk. At
      Thetford, this branch diverged, with one road continuing to Norwich, the other going to King's
      Lynn. One major east-west road travelled through early Suffolk, going from Ipswich to Bury,
       <rs ref="eats:324038" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Newmarket</rs> and Cambridge. In four spots
      along this east-west road (at <rs ref="eats:373705" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Creeting St
       Mary</rs>, Elmswell, Bury St Edmunds, and Newmarket) branches travelled south-north into
      Norfolk.
     </p>

     <p>Based on the number of payments to <rs ref="eats:8782" type="Entertainer_Type">players</rs>
      in the Suffolk records and elsewhere, these main roads from London to Suffolk, and from
      Suffolk into the midlands, constituted part of the most heavily travelled circuit for
      professional performers in the kingdom. Interestingly, the many payments to itinerant
      professionals in Suffolk occur only in communities on or very near these few major roads. The
      payments themselves occur only in the accounts of towns, religious foundations, and private
      households. While Suffolk's <rs ref="eats:3576" type="Collective_Office">churchwardens'</rs>
      and religious guild accounts record exceptionally robust amateur local playing traditions in
      parishes, none of those parish and guild accounts (with one exception) contain payments to
      professional troupes (nationally). The reasons for the apparent separateness of the two
      traditions may partly lie in the robust nature of Suffolk's powerful market towns, parishes,
      and religious guilds as patrons and producers of local religious drama (see discussions below
      under towns, parishes, and guilds). Perhaps it is just a matter of professionals sticking to
      their own pre-planned circuits for their own reasons.</p>

     <p>In addition to its main roadways, early Suffolk had a vast capillary system of local roads.
      The density of its population and the magnitude of its agricultural and industrial needs,
      together with a host of other social factors, made that network of local routes necessary. As
      Mark Bailey has observed, various kinds of evidence serve to confirm the presence and
      importance of these local roads. Among those sources are: the considerable expenditures for
      bridges in financial records; the many charitable bequests for the upkeep of roads in wills;
      the regulation of specific local roads by courts; the ubiquitous presence of two-wheeled carts
      used on roads to carry <rs ref="eats:40978" type="Thing_FoodDrink">grain</rs>, <rs
       ref="eats:40997" type="Thing_FoodDrink">wines</rs>, herring, and other goods and produce; the
      movement of livestock; the manorial renting of horses and carts to conduct business in ways
      involving travel; the great number of cart horses recorded; and manorial records.<note

     <p>One form of evidence that has not been considered in the study of local roads is the local
      playing circuits that are characteristic of Suffolk. Records show that each of Suffolk's
      topographical regions had local playing circuits in which various forms of inter-parish
      support involving travel existed among a great number of parishes. Communities travelled to
      announce their plays; people from other parishes travelled to attend those plays; communities
      loaned <rs ref="eats:42274" type="Thing_TheatricalCostume">theatrical gear</rs>, costumes, and
      scripts to other communities; neighbouring communities exchanged customary traditions. Some
      communities cooperated in the production of a shared play. <rs ref="eats:371513"
       type="Place_PA_Settlement">Boxford's</rs> churchwardens' accounts give the names of
      twenty-eight communities who in one year contributed support for Boxford's play. A map of the
      required roads in that instance would look as interlaced as a spider's web. The intricate
      number of possible reasons why small communities cooperated in their production of local
      religious drama is yet to be fully resolved, but the evidence clearly shows that interparish
      cooperation involved mobility and that the mobility would have required many more local roads
      than are shown on contemporary maps.</p>

     <p>Because of Suffolk's navigable rivers, many roads, and negotiable regions, its early borders
      were not barriers so much as doors, in a manner of speaking, opening the way to and from
      London, the midlands, the eastern coast of England, Iceland and the countries of the
      continent, most notably the low countries.</p>

     <p>Those three features, among others, have always attracted a large population to Suffolk.
      Using archaeological, financial, and manorial documents, David Dymond and Peter Northeast
      estimate Suffolk's population as being 72,000 in 1066. The two most informed and recent
      estimates by professional medieval historians independently estimate the population <hi
       rend="italic">c</hi> 1340 as being around 225,000.<note type="foot">Dymond and Northeast,

      'one of the most densely populated, intensively farmed and economically advanced counties of
      England,' with an ever-growing population. However, in the mid-fourteenth century the Black
      Death is estimated to have killed between half and two-thirds of Suffolk's population. Three
      hundred years later the population had not yet returned to pre-plague numbers.<note

        Atlas</title>, p 80.</note> Citing the research of John Patten, Gordon Blackwood estimates
      Suffolk's population as being 90,000 in 1520, 108,000 in 1603, and 125,000 in 1670. He lists
      seventeen Suffolk towns having at least 1,000 inhabitants at some point between 1524 and 1670.
      All but two doubled their population between 1524 and 1670, with the number of urban dwellers
      in Suffolk rising from fifteen to twenty-seven percent during those years.<note type="foot"
       >Blackwood, <title>Tudor and Stuart Suffolk</title>, pp 4–6, 265–6 nn 21–34.</note> All but
      one of those seventeen towns (<rs ref="eats:374563" type="Place_PA_Settlement"
      >Halesworth</rs>) left dramatic records, but all the seventy-six other Suffolk communities
      that left dramatic records had populations much smaller than those seventeen towns. There
      appears to be no necessary correlation between size of population and amount of dramatic
      activity. Ipswich, for example, had a population roughly comparable to that of Bury St Edmunds
      during much of the sixteenth century, yet it has left a greater volume of dramatic records.
       <rs ref="eats:386439" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Walsham-le-Willows</rs> had a population
      comparable to a number of its neighbouring villages, yet it had a <rs ref="eats:386537"
       type="Place_F_OpenArea">dedicated outdoor playing space</rs> where plays were certainly
      staged, while those other communities apparently did not. In relation to the presence of
      performance in early Suffolk, other factors seem more significant than size of population.</p>

     <p>The years between 1360 and 1530 brought great prosperity to Suffolk, mainly from four
      principal sources: the <rs ref="eats:302518" type="Thing_ClothingMaterials">cloth</rs> trade,
      agriculture, fishing, and the proceeds from continental warfare.<note type="foot">Dymond and
       Northeast, <title>History of Suffolk</title>, p 55.</note> During this period, 'the cloth
      industry reached a major peak of prosperity, and especially so in the main broadcloth area of
      South Suffolk,' centred in the hundreds of Babergh and Cosford. With it came huge wealth,
      plentiful employment in the cloth trade, a new class of capitalists, and a surge in local
      pride and patronage that led to the building or refurbishment or re-building of magnificent
      parish churches and 'fine timber-framed houses,' both in the cloth-making regions, along the
      Suffolk coast, and in the central dairying regions.<note type="foot">Dymond and Northeast,
        <title>History of Suffolk</title>, pp 51–2, 53.</note> The prosperous years coincide with
      references to locally-sponsored performance and ceremony, and fund raising in religious guild
      and parish records. Documents show considerable ownership of local religious responsibility by
      the craftsmen and craftswomen, capitalists, and merchants in Suffolk's ever-more-prosperous
      towns on the eve of the Reformation.</p>

     <p>Much of this relative peace, prosperity, and unanimity was swept away in the tumult of the
      sixteenth century. Four principal and interrelated kinds of stresses repeatedly bludgeoned the
      county during that century and the first half of the next. The economic stresses are easy
      enough to summarize. Most catastrophic was the decline of the cloth trade caused by the
      collapsing demand for Suffolk dyed cloth in Europe, together with the <rs ref="eats:58759"
       type="Collective_Occupations">clothiers</rs>' wide-spread failure to adjust to changing
      fashions; together with the increasing control of Suffolk’s coastal and overseas trade by
      London merchants, especially from the mid-fifteenth century. Other economic factors included
      the imposition of export restrictions, funding needs for the war with Spain, and the rise of
      venture capitalists (such as the Merchant Adventurers), who competed for investment monies.
      Further, a rising urban population with its attendant need for food caused a boom in
      agriculture; but while food costs rose, wages declined. Decreasing demand for fish damaged the
      fishing trades; encroachment by the sea and silting damaged ports and harbours; and piracy
      increased. These economic hardships brought with them an explosive atmosphere of civil unrest,
      seen most notably in the outbreaks of 1549 and 1569.<note type="foot">Dymond and Northeast,

     <head>Religious History</head>

     <p>The county of Suffolk became part of the southern province of the <rs ref="eats:205167"
       type="Collective_Clergy">archbishop of Canterbury</rs> in the seventh century. From 1094
      through 1836 all of Suffolk (excepting the three episcopal peculiars of Moulton, <rs
       ref="eats:372100" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Hadleigh</rs>, and <rs ref="eats:371909"
       type="Place_PA_Settlement">Monk's Eleigh</rs>) was part of the diocese of Norwich. From 1125
      on, under the bishop of that diocese, Suffolk had two archdeaconries (the archdeaconry of
      Sudbury for West Suffolk, and the archdeaconry of Suffolk for East Suffolk). Those two
      archdeaconries bore administrative and disciplinary responsibility for the county's
      twenty-three rural deaneries (similar to the hundreds in their boundaries and names), whose
      rural deans in turn oversaw the clergy, the churches, and the other properties of 501 parishes
      (many dating, in origin and dimensions, from the late Anglo-Saxon period). The great East
      Anglian historian Norman Scarfe has shown that 418 of Suffolk's many parish churches were
      already founded by 1086, and he has identified at least thirty-two certain or likely minsters
      (central churches with teams of priests serving several parishes) from that early period, in
      patterns violently disrupted (especially in northeast Suffolk) by the Danish invasions.
      Significantly, according to Scarfe, 'the distribution of [[these early]] minsters seems to be
      related to the principal rivers, with strings [[of minsters]] lining the Waveney, Gipping and
      Stour valleys,' and to their connection 'with important royal or ecclesiastical manors.' The
      great new personal and civic wealth that came to Suffolk via commerce in the late medieval
      period led directly to the reconstruction of many of these parish churches. Cumulatively, they
      became one of the architectural glories of the county.<note type="foot">Joanna Martin,

        Atlas</title>, pp 52–3.</note></p>

     <p>Suffolk's many religious foundations (its abbey, colleges, friaries, nunneries, priories,
      and small cells) formed another major presence in the spiritual, economic, and cultural life
      of the county. At the time of the dissolution, Suffolk had forty functioning religious
      foundations (down from the sixty-plus listed by Knowles and the seventy-four listed by Cox).
      They represented nine religious orders, plus the Knights Templars, the Knights Hospitalers,
      and the Premonstratensian Canons. Collectively, these foundations possessed some 200 manors.
      The greater number of these religious foundations lay in East Suffolk. Far fewer of them lay
      in West Suffolk, a fact apparently reflecting the dominant presence there of the <rs
       ref="eats:368503" type="Place_F_ReligiousHouse">abbey of Bury St Edmunds</rs>, one of the
      largest, wealthiest, and most revered abbeys and sites of pilgrimage in England. <note

      2025].</note></p>
     <p>Religious foundations in Suffolk ranged in size from fifty to eighty monks at Bury St
      Edmunds, to two monks constituting the entire membership in each of several tiny foundations.
      The greatest number of houses were the Augustinians, the numerous hospitals, and the secular
      colleges, although in general friaries attracted a greater number of inhabitants than did
      monasteries and nunneries. Religious houses held authority over many of Suffolk's parishes.
      Although they were major landlords in the county, religious houses often rented their manorial
      properties and lands to others, thereby enriching glebes and properties in many of Suffolk
      parishes, although the religious houses reserved to themselves much of the wealth deriving
      from those properties.<note type="foot"> Peter Northeast, 'Religious Houses,' in Dymond and
       Martin, <title>Historical Atlas</title>, pp 70–1.</note> Many of these religious manorial
      lands included parcels that became (or already were) the camping closes or outdoor
      recreational sites that became a distinguishing feature of the Suffolk landscape (see, for
      example, the game place at Beccles).</p>
    </div>

    <div>
     <head>Guilds</head>

     <p>Religious guilds were a vital feature in pre-Reformation Suffolk's social, administrative,
      and religious history. The existence of some 500 religious guilds based on local parish
      churches has been confirmed in the county, and the presence of numerous others can be inferred
      from wills, accounts, tax rolls, and other forms of evidence. The guilds, however, were not
      evenly distributed throughout the county. Northeast has shown that while the majority of
      parishes in both the west and northeast parts of Suffolk had one or more religious guilds,
      most parishes in southeast Suffolk were served by three very large, 'centrally-placed,' guilds
      (at <rs ref="eats:374458" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Framlingham</rs>, Kelsale, and
      Woodbridge), and a very few others, a situation perhaps influenced by the powerful manorial
      presence of the Duke of Norfolk.<note type="foot">Northeast, 'Parish Gilds,' in Dymond and
       Martin, <title>Historical Atlas</title>, p 74.</note></p>

     <p>An exponential rise in the number of religious guilds in Suffolk occurred in the aftermath
      of the Black Death of 1348–9. Guilds provided the 'communal response' to the religious and
      social needs that had been lost in the near obliteration of families and parishes. At the same
      time the rise of religious guilds reflected the growing affluence and economic power of the
      laity, most visible in the number of surviving guildhalls that remain one of Suffolk's
      architectural glories. The roles and contributions of the religious guilds are a matter of
      some complexity. In addition to religious and social services, in some places guilds became
      what Northeast calls 'civic guilds,' functioning as governing bodies. In the fourteenth
      century Ipswich renamed its gild merchant as the <rs ref="eats:402310"
       type="Collective_GuildsReligious">guild of Corpus Christi</rs>; in Bury the gild merchant
      became the <rs ref="eats:371701" type="Collective_GuildsReligious">Candlemas guild</rs>.<note
       type="foot"> Northeast, 'Parish Gilds,' in Dymond and Martin, <title>Historical
       Atlas</title>, p 74; and Bailey, <title>Medieval Suffolk</title>, pp 250, 140-141.</note> The
      magnitude of the contributions of these religious guilds to local drama, custom, and ceremony
      in pre-Reformation Suffolk cannot be overstated. Together with parishes, they were the chief
      patrons of vernacular religious drama, custom, and ceremony.</p>

     <p>Craft guilds, on the other hand, are rare in early Suffolk, and it is not clear whether
      those existing thought of themselves as guilds in the same way that we do. No craft guilds
      existed in rural areas, but they do appear in Bury and Ipswich. Bury had three known craft
      entities (the <rs ref="eats:371554" type="Collective_GuildsOccupational">Weavers</rs>, Bakers,
      and Cordwainers). The Bakers' guild dated from the late twelfth century. The regulations of
      the Weavers (the only craft regulations to survive for Bury) don't use the word guild (the
      regulations refer to groups of craftsmen repeatedly as 'the Ocupiers of the seyd Crafte'). The
      Weavers bore responsibility for an Ascension <rs ref="eats:403978" type="Entertainment_Type"
       >pageant</rs>, one of several in the annual procession; however an entity other than the
      Weavers (likely the Candlemas guild) had authority over the procession. That is, the craft
      guild subordinated itself to the principal religious guild in matters of performance. The same
      principle applied in Ipswich (see the discussion of <ref target="#background-ipswich">its Corpus Christi celebration below</ref>).</p>
    </div>

    <div>
     <head>Public Administration</head>

     <p>The system of public administration had very ancient roots in Suffolk. From at least the
      late Anglo-Saxon period forward, the basis of public administration in Suffolk was the
      hundred, an area thought either to represent 'a hundred <hi rend="italic">hides</hi> or family
      holdings' or 'even older land units.' The hundreds were 'the basis of all public
      administration in medieval England, judicial, fiscal and military,' superseded only by the
      county court.<note type="foot"> Edward Martin, 'Hundreds and Liberties,' in Dymond and Martin,
        <title>Historical Atlas</title>, pp 26–7. Much of the information here provided concerning
       public administration in Suffolk is informed by Martin.</note> In 1086 the county had
      twenty-five hundreds of various size; however, the number changed several times in subsequent
      centuries. A hundred bailiff presided over the hundred (or moot) courts. Originally nearly
      all-powerful, during the course of the medieval period the hundred courts gradually lost a
      good part of their authority to the rise of royal justice, the quarter sessions courts,
      municipal courts, and a sheriff from 1576 on.</p>

     <p>Several other kinds of administrative entities existed alongside or superimposed across the
      authority of the hundreds. They included: the boroughs of Ipswich, Bury, and Sudbury (which
      were separate hundreds); the liberties of St Ethelreda Abbey at Ely and St Edmund Abbey at
      Bury (areas within which the crown had effectively privatized the functions and profits of the
      hundreds within the liberties of the two abbeys, answerable not to the sheriff or borough but
      to the lord); the north and south capitals of the geldable (a taxable unit under royal
      jurisdiction), at <rs ref="eats:373096" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Beccles</rs> and Ipswich
      respectively; and several feudal liberties, including the honours (areas in which the lord had
      certain additional rights based on the number of manors which he held in Suffolk and
      elsewhere) of Clare, Eye, and Haughley, the manors of the duke of Norfolk, and the southern
      seat of the <rs ref="eats:429410" type="Collective_Clergy">bishop of Norwich</rs> at Elmham.
      In the historical period covered by this edition, Suffolk returned sixteen members to
      parliaments: two knights of the shire, and two members each from its seven parliamentry
      boroughs: Dunwich and Ipswich (from 1298), Orford (regularly from 1529), Sudbury (from 1558),
      Aldeburgh and Eye (from 1571), and Bury St Edmunds (from 1621).<note type="foot"> Martin,

    <div>
     <head>Education</head>

     <p>Writing in 1907, A.F. Leach offered several acute observations about education in early
      Suffolk. The unusually high proliferation of medieval grammar schools in Suffolk appears to
      reflect the county's early wealth, widespread commercial activity, and density of population.
      Many of those early schools, as Leach notes, far predate foundations by Edward VI and
      Elizabeth I. Even many of the schools founded in 1548 were actually re-foundings of much
      earlier schools. Most notably, at odds with the common view that early education sprang from
      the monasteries, early schools in Suffolk are 'found in connexion [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]
      with the secular clergy, not the monks.' Even at the first known <rs ref="eats:373556"
       type="Place_F_School">school in Bury</rs>, though he was appointed by the abbot, the master
      was a clerk, not a monk, and the school's students were not novices. That is, this earliest of
      Bury's schools was the public school of the town.<note type="foot"><title>VCH:
       Suffolk</title>, vol 2, pp 301–2, <title>BHO</title>
       <ref target="https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/suff/vol2"
        >https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/suff/vol2</ref> [accessed 8 February 2025].</note>
      Having a school, it appears, became a sought-after part of emerging civic identity for towns,
      a pattern also appearing to reflect the perpetual tension between religious authority and
      secular expression so characteristic of early Suffolk, and particularly strong in Bury.</p>

     <p>Leach identifies fifty-six schools: fourteen of them grammar schools established before the
      reign Edward VI, another sixteen petty schools founded during the later sixteenth and
      seventeenth centuries, and twenty-six of them elementary schools (six established before 1642;
      twenty of them after). The grammar school at Dunwich was the oldest school of its kind in
      England. Other grammar schools established well before 1548 included those at Beccles,
      Boxford, Bury, Clare, Eye, Hadleigh, Ipswich, Long Melford, Lowestoft, Stoke-by-Clare,
      Stowmarket and Sudbury. Elizabethan schools included those at Botesdale, Bungay, Palgrave, and
      Woodbridge. Jacobean and Caroline grammar schools included those at Aldeburgh, Brandon,
      Debenham, Framlingham, Gislingham, Lavenham, Little Thurlow, Mendlesham, Needham Market, and
      Stonham Aspall.<note type="foot"><title>VCH: Suffolk</title>, pp 301–56, <title>BHO</title>

      2025].</note></p>

     <p>On the other hand, visitation records show that many of Suffolk's religious houses had to be
      directed by authorities to provide grammar school and singing masters for their novices at a
      time when towns were purposefully creating them. The lack of drive within religious houses to
      maintain their schools is puzzling. J.C. Cox identifies eight functioning, lapsed or inferable
      song-schools at: the colleges of Clare, Mettingham, Stoke-by-Clare, Sudbury and Wingfield; at
      Woolsey's ill-fated Cardinal's College at Ipswich; and at Bury Abbey, and Butley Priory. He
      also describes eight monastic grammar schools (some of them combined with song-schools) at the
      abbey of Bury St Edmunds, Hoxne Priory, Butley Priory (the latter of which had boarding
      scholars and one scholar sent to university); at Ipswich Priory of St Peter and Paul; at
      Cardinal's College in Ipswich; and at <rs ref="eats:385096" type="Place_F_School">Mettingham
       College</rs>. Hoxne Priory appears to be nearly unique among Suffolk's religious foundations
      in that it 'kept a school [specifically] for the children of the parish, as opposed to
       novices.'<note type="foot"><title>VCH: Suffolk</title>, vol 2, p 301, <title>BHO</title>

     <head>Religion and Society</head>

     <p>Before the Reformation, the people of Suffolk shared a common theology. But pre-Reformation
      Christianity in Suffolk also reflected the social, political, and economic stresses afflicting
      Suffolk during the medieval period. Endless power struggles in the county (among towns,
      religious foundations, the Crown, knights and other lords, and the Papacy) together with
      catastrophic natural events, helped make protest, resistance, and periodic upheaval in matters
      of society and religion a distinctive and permanent feature of the Suffolk character. Three
      seismically important factors in particular brought fundamental change to society and religion
      in Suffolk, and turned the county into ripe ground for the sixteenth-century Reformation.</p>

     <p>Most devastating among them was the Black Death, which first struck the country in 1348.
      When it descended on Suffolk in 1349, the Black Death killed nearly half of the population.
      While the effects of the Black Death were unimaginably dire, historians Dymond and Northeast
      offer a corrective to the widely held view that the abandonment of buildings, the decline in
      rural population, and the leaving of lands untilled that occurred during the fourteenth
      century were mainly caused by the Black Death. In fact, after 1349 many heirs re-claimed the
      homes of family members who had fallen victim to the outbreak. Nor, they say, is it correct to
      refer to the many isolated churches in Suffolk as 'plague churches' of 1349 when, in fact, the
      Black Death merely advanced a process that was already occuring. Rather, it was later
      recurring outbreaks of the plague in the late fourteenth and fifteenth centuries that left
      'vacant buildings and shrunken villages.'<note type="foot"> Dymond and Northeast,
        <title>History of Suffolk</title>, pp 47–51.</note> More significantly, the Black Death left
      two-thirds of the county's parish priests dead. The loss of so many priests in 1349 crippled
      the ability of many parishes to conduct their traditional pastoral duties. In the vacuum, much
      care-giving work fell to the religious guilds in towns and villages. The men and women of
      those guilds (both sexes equally enfranchised by guild statutes), assumed many pastoral
      responsibilities (other than religious services), assisting the depleted clergy in providing
      traditional services such as chistenings, marriages and funerals. Practical piety moved
      increasingly into the hands of the laity via its guilds, whose powerful influence continued
      unabated until the abolition of the guilds under Edward VI.<note type="foot"> For important
       studies on the increase in ‘religious consumption’ by the laity and the lower orders during
       this period, see Judith Middleton Stewart, <title>Inward Piety, Outward Splendour: Death and

       439–59.</note> This guild-driven popular religion in post-Black Death Suffolk also served to
      water the seeds of a growing discontent directed at all-powerful ecclesiastical authority.
      Many of the religious plays sponsored by parishes (for example, the Brome <title>Abraham and
       Isaac</title>), not only spoke to the oceans of grief engulfing parishioners in Suffolk
      manors, towns and villages, many also contained implicit critiques of higher authority, both
      religious and secular.</p>

     <p>Two subsequent movements—one economic and political, one theological—further illustrate the
      fraught relationship between religion and society in medieval Suffolk. The county-wide
      insurrection in 1381 known as the Peasants' Revolt ushered in a decade of rebellion that
      plunged Suffolk into 'a state of reformist ferment.'<note type="foot"> John Rigard, ‘The
       Uprising of 1381,’ in Dymond and Martin, <title>Historical Atlas</title>, pp 90–1; Bailey,
        <title>Medieval Suffolk</title>, pp 184–93; Joe Chick, ‘The 1381 Rising in Bury St Edmunds:

       1381,’ <title>Proceedings of the Suffolk Institute of Archaeology and History</title>, 44.2
       (2018), pp 214–34.</note> As Ridgard describes it, rebels had purposely chosen the eight days
      that began the rebellion (12–18 June 1381) to coincide with the <rs ref="eats:41497"
       type="CalendarDay_Liturgical">feast of Corpus Christi</rs>, a time when people
      characteristically assembled for plays and ceremonies and processions. In fact, in Bury the
      rebellion included a theatrically conceived crowning of a king of Suffolk from among the
      rebels, and a conversation between the decapitated heads of the chief justice of England and
      the prior of the abbey at Bury, as well as other dramatic acts of public spectacle. The
      insurrection spread throughout the county, and the identified rebels numbered at least 2,000
      (including seventy women). The rebels' main objective was to seize legal, fiscal and manorial
      records (especially those of religious houses), since they included the names of villeins, and
      to destroy them in public burnings. The rebels' chief targets were establishment lawyers, tax
      collectors, and church leaders, whereas the rebel leaders themselves included 'lowly paid
      clergy.' The revolt was far from an isolated event. It followed centuries of periodically
      violent outbursts of grievance by nearly every segment of a Suffolk population long existing
      at the economic mercy of the ruling classes, as occurred at <ref target="#background-bury"
       >Bury St Edmunds</ref>. It would be followed by successive rebellions in the county. The
      rebellion of 1381 also reflected the rising importance of market towns that were effectively
      functioning as boroughs in all but name and charter, and a growing number of freemen farmers
      and husbandmen who built large agricultural holdings and leased many manorial demesnes in the
      century after the Black Death.</p>

     <p>The Lollard movement of the late fourteenth and early fifteenth century found equally
      fertile ground in Suffolk. The name Lollardy attached itself to a religious movement arising
      from the reformist prescriptions of Oxford theologian John Wycliffe (d. 1384), and his
      followers, originally known as Wycliffites. To a surprising degree, Wycliffe's teachings
      mirrored those that would later recur as foundational in the Reformation. Among their precepts
      were opposition to: the transubstantiation, confession, baptism, iconography, veneration of
      saints, oaths, fasting, prayers for the dead, pilgrimages, and ecclesiastical celibacy. That
      is, they were 'antisacramental and antisacerdotal.'<note type="foot"> Maureen Jurkowski,
       'Lollardy and Social Status,' <title>Speculum</title> 82.1 (January 2007), 123.</note>
      Maureen Jurkowski has shown that the majority of East Anglia's Lollards lived in east Suffolk
      and Norfolk in an area radiating nothward and southward from the Waveney Valley in or near
      thirty-eight small market towns and villages, plus several towns associated with the cloth
      market in central and south Suffolk. While adherents in East Anglia included artisans and
      tradesmen, most recorded Lollards, according to Jurkowski, were prosperous farmers and rural
      husbandmen who lived in small communities that were 'largely self-governing' and 'ruled
      largely by village elites and manorial officials.' East Anglian Lollardy 'was a faith that
      suited the aspirations of village elites and a nascent class of prosperous yeomen.'<note
       type="foot">Jurkowski, 'Lollardy and Social Status,' pp 123–4, 150–4.</note> Edwin Welch sees
      a strong connection between nonconformity and the 'early form of industrialization' prevalent
      in East Anglia that gave Lollardy a particularly strong appeal there. As he observes, many of
      the politically-driven rebel leaders in 1381 shared surnames with the theologically-driven
      leaders of the Lollard movement.<note type="foot"> Edwin Welch, 'Some Suffolk Lollards,'
        <title>Proceedings of the Suffolk Institute of Archaeology and Natural History</title> 29,
       pt 2 (1962), 154.</note></p>

     <p>Lollardy, as a movement, was short-lived. It was declared a heresy in 1382 and, although the
      movement opposed the Peasants' Revolt, Lollards were persecuted as traitors. The rebellion of
      Sir John Oldcastle in 1414 caused Lollardy to become connected to treason, and the movement,
      as a force, was gone by 1431.<note type="foot">Welch, 'Suffolk Lollards,' p 154.</note>
      However, its influence lingered into the sixteenth century in Suffolk. As Diarmaid MacCulloch
      observes, '[p]opular Protestantism could draw on the Lollard tradition preserved in the
      sixteenth century, particularly in such communities as Stoke by Nayland and Mendlesham.'<note
       type="foot">Diarmaid MacCulloch, <title>Suffolk and the Tudors: Politics and Religion in an
        English County 1500–1600</title> (Oxford, 1986), 317.</note> Lollards had a strong sense of
      community; they established schools and they used itinerant preachers—all features that would
      be central to the propagation of the Protestant faith in the sixteenth century. Just as in the
      sixteenth century, fairs, markets, and the Feast of Corpus Christi provided moments when
      people gathered in great numbers, an opportunity seized upon by both nonconformist dramatists
      and organizers, and which were greatly feared by the authorities.</p>

     <p>Much of the period between the 1360s and 1530 saw great economic growth and accompanying
      wealth in Suffolk. Although the period from 1370 to 1520 saw major shifts within Suffolk’s
      agriculture from arable to livestock, and in its economy from agriculture to manufacturing and
      retail, which made the fortunes of some and increased wealth per head for the vast majority,
      the slump in the textile industry in the early sixteenth century brought severe economic
      decline to the county and great hardship to its population. Those economic difficulties were
      as nothing compared to the century of religious upheaval caused by the Reformation that was to
      come. As Christopher Haigh and Patrick Collinson have pointed out, the so-called Reformation
      was actually four successive state-imposed reformations (Henrician, Edwardian, Marian, and
      Elizabethan) and a 'parallel evangelical Reformation' which, together with many other forces,
      set church, state, and people at various ends with each other in events that played out
      uniquely in every county, town, and hamlet of the land.<note type="foot"> Christopher Haigh,
        <title>English Reformations: Religion, Politics, and Society under the Tudors</title>
       (Oxford, 1993), p 14; Patrick Collinson, <title>The Birthpangs of Protestant England</title>
       (London, 1988).</note> As Alec Ryrie has shrewdly observed, describing the Reformation 'is
      governed by what you think is important and what is trivial, by whether there are heroes or
      villains you want to celebrate or condemn, and by the legacies and lessons which you think
       matter.'<note type="foot"> Alec Ryrie, <title>The English Reformation: A Very Brief
        History</title> (London, 2020), p xiv.</note> In Suffolk, the mosaic of reformation was as
      complex as the social traditions, the structures of local power and governance, and the
      economic stresses that drove each community (see the <ref target="#background-towns">section
       on towns and villages</ref> below).<note type="foot"> That complexity has been richly
       documented by John Craig, Diarmaid McCulloch, Patrick Collinson, and others. See Craig,

        Market Towns, 1500–1610</title>, St Andrews Studies in Reformation History (London, 2001);

       Reformations</title>; and Collinson, <title>Birthpangs</title>.</note></p>

     <p>The extent to which the Reformation of Henry VIII was essentially religious or political is
      a matter of perpetual debate among historians. Ryrie has compellingly made the case that 'the
      organizing principle, the doctrine' of Henry's religion was the royal supremacy rather than
      theology, his political objectives creating 'theological incoherence.'<note type="foot">Ryrie,
       'Divine Kingship and Royal Theology in Henry VIII's Reformation,' <title>Reformation</title>
       7.1 (2002), 54, 77.</note> Successive royal decrees concerning religion, while seeming
      reformist, certainly also had the effect of asserting the monarch's power while diminishing
      that of the Pontiff in Rome. In 1534 the Act of Supremacy acknowledged Henry as head of the
      Church of England; abolished 'Peter's Pence' (annual payments that each parish had been
      required to make to Rome); and reduced the number of church holidays from ninety to
      thirty.</p>

     <p>In 1536 in Suffolk, Henry closed the lesser abbey at Sibton, and the nunneries at Bungay and
      Campsey, and between 1537 and 1540 he closed the remaining twenty-eight larger houses in
      Suffolk. The effect cannot be overstated. As Page observes, ‘[p]robably no other county felt
      the change more keenly from a social and economic standpoint than was the case with Suffolk.’
      The dissolution left 273 <rs ref="eats:27258" type="Collective_Clergy">monks, canons, and
       nuns</rs> without a home or a mission. The county immediately lost many of its
      priest-schoolmasters; alms giving stopped at the entrances to religious houses, and tithing in
      150 parishes passed from monastic lords to civilian lords collectively more interested in
      collecting money than in parcelling it out to the needy. The dissolution ‘involved the largest
      confiscation and redistribution of land and property since the Norman Conquest.'<note

      booty went (by sale, grant, exchange, or some combination thereof) to the county’s two great

       ref="eats:167868" type="Person_Male">Thomas Howard</rs>, the dukes of Suffolk and Norfolk
      respectively), and eventually to five groups of individuals who became the county’s new ruling
      elite. They included five noblemen, the non-monastic Church, two local lawyers, a few
      important merchants, numerous royal officials, and three high-ranking officials who worked for
      Brandon or Howard. Half of the beneficiaries were Suffolk gentry, and they included both
      Catholics and Protestants.<note type="foot">Blackwood, <title>Tudor and Stuart

      permanent.</p>

     <p>Concerning religious practice nationwide, royal injunctions forbade placing candles before
      images, along with other 'superstitious' practices; ordered the destruction of images; forbade
      visible veneration of Thomas à Becket; ordered that every church have an English Bible; and
      with a royal decree on 22 July 1541, abolished the ceremony of the <rs ref="eats:21537"
       type="Entertainment_FolkCustom">boy bishop</rs>. Because the boy bishop symbolically replaced
      the actual ruler with the ruled, Henry saw it as ‘"unlawful superstition", a dangerous
      inversion of the God-given social order and thus perhaps a form of indirect treason.’<note
       type="foot">Dymond and Northeast, <title>History of Suffolk</title>, pp 60–1; and Ryrie,
       'Divine Kingship,' p 71.</note> Since most mimetic customs used similar inversions (Robin
      Hood, Christmas Lords, May Ladies, etc) the decree implicitly represented a serious potential
      threat to the survival of traditional customs in general. In December 1545, near the end of
      Henry’s reign and spurred by his requests, parliament passed an act that 'empowered the King,
      if he wished, to dissolve any chantries, colleges, hospitals or guilds' and seize their
      endowments; however, he did not actually exercise that power.<note type="foot">Peter Marshall,

      conservatives erupted in the 1530s, most dramatically in Hadleigh and Ipswich, but in other
      towns and parts of the countryside as well. While most clergy remained conservative,
      evangelical preachers from Cambridge and merchants and other travellers returning from the Low
      Countries brought protestant fervour to Suffolk. The diversity of views within the great
      households of Suffolk was no less inflammable. During these years, the first wave of the
      county's martyrs occurred in the religious tinder box that Suffolk had become during Henry's
       reign.<note type="foot"> For meticulous descriptions of the Henrician Reformation in Suffolk,

     <p>Following the death of Henry VIII in 1547, the short reign of Edward VI (1547–53) brought
      sudden, massive, and foundational religious change to England. In what Ryrie describes as ‘an
      internal coup,' justification by faith only became (as Marshall says) ‘the centre of the
      teaching mission of the English Church,' replacing the doctrine that souls could also be
      redeemed by penitential suffering, good works, intercession and participation in ritualized
      communal worship.<note type="foot"> Marshall, <title>Heretics</title>, pp 307–8. Much of the
       description that follows is indebted to Marshall, pp 302–27.</note> In condemning those
      traditional practices as 'papistical superstitions,’ it abandoned the related concepts of
      Purgatory, Confession, and the Eucharist.</p>

     <p>The new government undertook its reformist campaign with lightning speed, the autumn of 1547
      bringing what Peter Marshall calls 'a festival of destruction' in churches. Specifically, in
      1547 royal injunctions reaffirmed the Henrican proscription of shrines and processions.
      Injunctions also ordered: change of the liturgy; replacement of the old Latin service with an
      English service; the replacement of wall paintings with texts from scripture; the destruction
      of objects retained from pilgrimages; the use of an English book of common prayer (except in
      college chapels and grammar schools, which might still use Latin); the removal of candles and
      incense before images; and the destruction in churches of statues, including roods. One of
      their first actions, the Chantries Act of 6 December 1547, was nothing less than 'a second
      dissolution' in its financial and cultural impact.<note type="foot"> Marshall,
        <title>Heretics</title>, p 310; Ryrie, <title>English Reformation</title>, pp 24–25.</note>
      Of grave significance to parish life, it abolished all chantries and parish religious guilds
      or confraternities, which had provided sponsorship and infrastructure for the production of
      fund-raising religious drama and games as a form of lay religious practice.</p>

     <p>The imposed changes continued unabated. In 1548 the regime abolished the use of ashes,
      palms, and candles on, respectively, Ash Wednesday, Palm Sunday and the Feast of the
      Purification of the Virgin. It banned the use of holy bread and holy water, as well as the
      ceremony of creeping to the cross on Good Friday, and it suppressed the ringing of knells.
      Further, it imposed a 'blanket ban on church imagery,' made confession optional, and
      authorized the sale of chantry lands. In short, its actions caused a 'huge local disruption'
      to the 'financial and devotional life' of parishes, replacing lay piety with spiritual
      rhetoric fed by an extraordinary proliferation of evangelical presses. In 1549 it changed the
      language of the liturgy into an English book of common prayer, while abolishing the feast of
      Corpus Christi and many other important feasts.</p>

     <p>As had always happened in Suffolk, the shape and intensity of responses to religious change
      in the county reflected the complicated character of the county. As MacCulloch puts it, the
      Suffolk character combined 'conventional commitment to Catholic piety’ (most strikingly seen
      in the grand churches of its cloth towns) with 'a tendency towards independence of mind and an
      interest in dissident ideas' (reflecting the wealth and mobility of labour in the cloth
       towns).<note type="foot">MacCulloch, <title>Suffolk and the Tudors</title>, p 176.</note>
      Surviving parish and civic records show that on the eve of the Reformation, Suffolk parishes
      were thriving Catholic communities, immersed in the pietistic and festive rituals, ceremonies
      and entertainments associated with traditional communal town and village life, activities seen
      as good and godly service.</p>

     <p>Sophisticated fund-raising drama and games, in particular, flourished. Yet beginning in the
      early 1530s Reformation ideologies took root in Suffolk parishes with extraordinary speed. The
      reasons defy facile generalizations, but as MacCulloch fairly says: 'What would matter in the
      East Anglian parishes would be the combination of the new ideas from Germany with the existing
      obscure undercurrents of dissent in the parishes.' He cites several possible factors:
      encounters of Suffolk's merchants with Lutheranism in their continental dealings; a continuity
      between the resistance mentality of Lollardism (as it survived in Suffolk) and the congruent
      ideas of Protestantism; and the rapid spread of new ideas facilitated by the travels of the
      new Protestant preachers.<note type="foot"> Diarmaid MacCulloch, 'The Impact of the
       Reformation on Suffolk Parish Life,' <title>The Suffolk Review</title> 15 (Autumn 1990),
       4–6.</note> One might also note the persistent resentment against rents and other taxes
      levied by the Church, and the independent-mindedness of town bodies that had become
      essentially self-governing in the face of absentee landlords.</p>

     <p>The revolutionary change thus begun effected 'a mammoth effort of realignment of parish life
      which dwarfed the hesitant beginnings of change' by the earlier monarchs.<note type="foot"
       >MacCulloch, 'Impact,' p 11.</note> It shifted the centre of communal religious life from the
      parish church to a preaching clergy and sometimes interminable sermons.<note type="foot">
       MacCulloch, 'Impact,' pp 14–16.</note> The movement swept away most fund-raising customs,
      rituals and drama. Above all, this evangelizing reformation enforced the creation of new ways
      of being—religiously, socially, and politically—everywhere in the kingdom, changing the very
      definition of community.</p>

     <p>While the massive religious and social changes imposed by reformists fractured communal
      harmony in many parishes (as evidence from court records most vividly testifies), Christopher
      Marsh has shown that while the Reformation brought community-destroying conflict, the period
      experienced a different process in many parishes as well. He describes a complex, as yet
      imperfectly understood, evolution in which the great number of parishioners forged the social
      and spiritual continuities that they would hope for were they to live in a peaceful community.
      They did so by adhering to authority, by finding sufficiently acceptable continuities between
      the liturgy of the traditional religion and that of the newly imposed one, and by maintaining
      at least transactional harmony through neighbourliness and charity. The success with which a
      given community might bridge the seemingly insurmountable contradictions of the age, as Marsh
      shows, was largely determined by unique societal factors within each individual parish, and by
      their skillfull application of the new religious dicta.<note type="foot"> Christopher Marsh,

     <p>Predictably, this massive assault on traditional religious culture brought waves of bloody
      protest throughout the kingdom. The Western Rebellion, begun in Cornwall in 1547, expanded to
      Devon in 1548. Protests ignited across the kingdom in the summer of 1549 with rioting,
      looting, assaults on landlords, encampments, and petitions to the Crown.<note type="foot"

      Thomas à Becket in Wymondham, spread to Yarmouth and other Norfolk towns, and centred finally
      at a huge rebel encampment on the outskirts of Norwich where many hundreds would die. It
      spread as well into Suffolk towns, most notably Bury St Edmunds and Ipswich. While the cause
      of rebellion in the Western counties was strongly theological, Kett’s Rebellion was
      principally fuelled by anger at rapacious economic policies imposed by both by the Crown and
      wealthy local landlords.<note type="foot"> Fletcher and MacCulloch, <title>Tudor

     <p>When the Edwardian whirlwind ended with Edward's illness and death in 1553, his Catholic
      sister, Mary, moved to reinstate (as official policy) much of the cultural and religious
      traditionalism that Edward's regime had sought to destroy. However, her five-year reign
      brought not a sudden and simple obverse Catholic image of Edward's seven-year Protestant rule,
      but a fraught chain of events. She needed first to secure her throne, which she did at the
      beginning of her reign with great daring and with what turned out to be massive support from
      leaders in the eastern parts of Suffolk.<note type="foot">Marshall, <title>Heretics</title>,
       pp 358–9.</note> While Suffolk had become a solidly Protestant county by the mid-sixteenth

      evade capture, seize power, and secure the throne.<note type="foot"> MacCulloch,

     <p>Although her throne was securely established, she faced complexity in matters of religious
      practice that could have led to civil war at the very beginning of her reign. In August 1553
      she moved quickly to restore traditional Catholic liturgy, ritual, and music (and followed it
      herself), yet she also allowed the funeral of Edward VI to be performed by <rs
       ref="eats:139370" type="Person_Male">bishop Gardiner</rs> in Westminster Cathedral, on 8
      August, using the 1552 Prayer Book (although she subsequently also ordered Gardiner to
      celebrate a requiem for Edward, together with a general public claim that the new state had
      accepted Catholic orthodoxy as an act of conscience not the imposition of Catholicism on the
      nation). It was, as Marshall puts it, 'England's first declaration of formal religious
      toleration, albeit an explicitly temporary [and tactical] one.’<note type="foot">Marshall,
        <title>Heretics</title>, p 363.</note> It mainly served to sow confusion and political
      hesitancy on both sides. Beneath this stable-appearing surface stirred thorny issues. What
      precisely would be the future relationship between the Papacy and the English church and
      state? Would the wealthy gentry be required to return monastic lands and wealth? Would the new
      queen undertake a dynastic marriage?<note type="foot"> Marshall, <title>Heretics</title>, pp
       365–8.</note></p>

     <p>These controversies culminated in January–February 1553/4, when Mary faced the most
      dangerous rebellion of her reign, saving her throne by the sheer bravura of her response.<note
       type="foot">Marshall, <title>Heretics</title>, pp 368–73.</note> Her victory brought the two
      responses that have come to define her five-year reign: the full-throated implementation of
      Catholic orthodoxy and practice; and, in its wake, the imposition of bloody justice. The new
      orthodoxy restored processions, ceremonies, holy days, fasts, tithing; and the defrocking of
      married priests (all seen most impactfully at the parish level). The hardening of views
      deepened on both sides.<note type="foot">Marshall, <title>Heretics</title>, pp
      372–9.</note></p>

     <p>The new justice reflected a return to the defining of conscience-driven resistance as heresy
      so as to require burning at the stake, of individuals and groups, in ever-growing numbers as a
      form of religio-political theatre. Mary restored a statute, <hi rend="italic">de Haeretico
       Comburendo</hi> (the burning of heretics), originally passed by Parliament on 10 March 1400/1
      but repealed by Henry VIII, and again repealed by Elizabeth I following the reign of Mary. The
      Marian enforcement began with the execution of some 100 rebel leaders between February and
      April 1554. During the next three years her regime burned several hundred 'heretics,' great
      and obscure, often in mass burnings, the latter of which seems to have been the preferred
       way.<note type="foot">Marshall, <title>Heretics</title>, pp 372–416.</note></p>

     <p>When Elizabeth I ascended the throne on 17 November 1558, a moderate Protestantism once
      again became the state-sanctioned religion of England. But the country itself was riven by
      dangerous theological, political, and social conflicts among reformist Protestants and
      Catholics alike. It was undoubtedly the Catholics who would pose the greatest existential
      threat during the first three decades of Elizabeth’s reign. Managing those chasmic divisions
      and accelerating existential threats would become the never-ending masterwork of the queen and
      her councillors during her half-century of rule.<note type="foot">Ryrie, <title>English
        Reformation</title>, p 59.</note></p>

     <p>Her problem was the irreconcilable gap between the ideologues on both sides and her own
      principal objective, which was to have ‘quiet and orderliness’ in her kingdom. Her means to
      that end was the twin acts of supremacy and uniformity passed by parliament in 1559. It
      prescribed uniformity (via the Book of Common Prayer) and Royal Supremacy, while seeking to
      couple them with a leniency and tolerance toward Catholics that seems to have been part of her
       nature.<note type="foot">Marshall, <title>Heretics</title>, pp 419–27.</note> To that end,
      she reestablished her father’s ‘moderate middle way’ or ‘<hi rend="italic">via media</hi>’ as
      her own operating principle, coupling it with a steely unwillingness to waver from a position
      once she had taken it.<note type="foot">Ryrie, <title>English Reformation</title>, p
       68.</note></p>

     <p>The queen’s approach had the opposite effect to the one she intended. Her complex approach
      caused both sides to conclude that she was a ‘Nicodemite Queen’ (one who hides his or her true
      religious feelings behind dissembling), a suspicion causing great fear and anxiety among her
      allies and the protestant reformists, and undue hopes among Catholics who were encouraged by
      her liking for dignified and formal ceremonialism, her love of choral music, her acceptance of
      a controlled episcopacy; her rejection of marriage by clergy; and her retention of a crucifix
      in her private chapel.<note type="foot">As Ryrie points out, in spite of Protestant fears,
       Elizabeth supported the Calvinist doctrine of predestination and the use of a common book of
       prayer, and over the course of her reign universities steadily developed protestant
       ministers; towns endowed ‘lectureships’ for preachers; reformists produced a flood of robust
       rhetoric via ‘cheap pamphlets and ballads’; the English Church introduced the Geneva bible;
       and the queen’s preference for law and structure advanced long–sought protestant uniformity;
       see Ryrie, <title>English Reformation</title>, pp 58–65, 72; Marshall,
        <title>Heretics</title>, pp 448–9.</note></p>

     <p>The relentless efforts of ideologues on both sides forced the queen and her ministers to
      move inexorably from moderate policies to violent and repressive ones. Elizabeth’s continuous
      purging of Catholic rites and core beliefs brought Catholics together as an aggrieved,
      threatened community, and galvanized European Catholicism. In their trajectory, the actions
      and counter-actions of Crown and Catholics between 1565 and 1588 took on a tragic
      inevitability culminating in two incalculably significant events: the Crown’s execution of
      Mary, Queen of Scots, on 8 February 1586/7 (an action resulting from the perception that
      Catholic plotting had dangerously merged with the ambitions of the Scottish queen); and the
      English defeat in August 1588 of the invading Spanish Armada.<note type="foot">Marshall,
        <title>Heretics</title>, pp 419–75. Marshall’s exhaustive survey of reactions by the Crown
       to resistance to conformity between 1559 and 1588 shows the uninterrupted intensification of
       the violence on both sides, notably: the purging of Catholics from official positions and the
       publishing of new articles of faith and the rejecting of transubstantiation and purgatory in
       1563; the formalizing of the recusancy law in the early 1560’s; the Catholic rising in 1569
       that brought violent and bloody retribution from Elizabeth; the papal declaration of
       Elizabeth as a heretic in 1570 followed by schemes to assassinate her; the execution of
       priests between 1571–3; and the beheading of Mary, Queen of Scots in 1587; see pp 457, 467,
       491, 493–5, 498, 560.</note></p>

     <p>The English saw their maritime victory as the victory of their religion. While the Catholic
      question would continue to bedevil (so to speak) England, erupting most spectacularly in the
      attempt to blow up King James and the English parliament in 1605, there was no question after
      1588 that England was a Protestant nation.<note type="foot">Marshall, <title>Heretics</title>,
       pp 575–77.</note> The battles to come between 1588 and the English Civil War in 1642 were
      between parliamentarian and royalist sympathizers. The English were now free to get really
      nasty with each other.</p>

     <p>Elizabethan Suffolk remained its contradictory, nationally significant, self during her
      reign. While still one of the most Protestant-minded counties in England, Suffolk’s powerful
      conservative elements, which had put Mary on the throne and remained loyal to her memory, also
      represented a potent political force in the county. But being weary of conflict and ‘religious
      extremism,’ as Diarmaid MacCulloch puts it, the county’s elite from both camps initially
      adopted a ‘state of cautious compromise,’ gracefully accepting the new queen.<note type="foot"
       >MacCulloch, <title>Suffolk and the Tudors</title>, pp 181–2.</note> Open conflict would
      return with a vengence throughout the 1560s and 1570s.</p>

     <p>In his close study of <rs ref="eats:311842" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Mildenhall's</rs>
      churchwardens' accounts, for example, John Craig reveals a complex interplay between the
      town's 'reasonable observance to the Protestant order of the day’ and 'concerns reflective
      more of local initiatives than of deference to authority,’ specifically to 'a growth of
      puritanism' and 'a world of nonconformity and dissent' in the parish. The accounts reflect the
      conflict between two factions—conservatives and non-conformists—in the people and the clergy
      of the parish by the community’s swift embrace of Protestantism. Communal harmony withered
      away as the very idea of what constituted a community changed utterly. Figures such as Thomas
      Bilney, the brilliant and inflammatory preacher and Cambridge don, turned the county into a
      rhetorical arena, as did the minister and playwright, <rs ref="eats:84791" type="Person_Male"
       >John Bale</rs>. For example, the large religious morality plays which were one of the
      fifteenth-century cultural jewels of Suffolk, and which dramatized the journey of the self
      toward redemption, gave way to political moralities that satirically and parodically
      dramatized 'seditious' themes about the powerful. The age of ideologies put down some of its
      earliest and deepest English roots in Suffolk.<note type="foot">Craig,
        <title>Reformation</title>, pp 53–8. Other rich sources of evidence can also be brought to
       bear more fully in the study of the popular response to Protestantism, most notably the
       charges and witness testimonies in the rich deposition books of the ecclesiastical courts and
       the order books of the quarter sessions courts, not to mention the statutes of local
       confraternities or religious guilds (until 1547); see James Stokes (ed),
        <title>Somerset</title>, REED (Toronto, 1996), and <title>Lincolnshire</title>, REED
       (Toronto, 2009).</note></p>

     <p>In the latter years of the 1570s the Crown was carefully watching Suffolk move toward
      crisis. As Patrick Collinson has said: ‘This was a region whose very soul was at stake, as
      progressive, Protestantizing, elements competed for the upper hand with conservative,
      Catholic, or crypto-Catholic forces.’<note type="foot">Patrick Collinson, ‘Pulling the
       Strings: Religion and Politics in the Progress of 1578,’ <title>The Progresses, Pageants, and
        Entertainments of Queen Elizabeth I</title>, Jayne Elizabeth Archer <hi rend="italic">et
        al</hi> (eds) (Oxford, 2007), 126.</note> Two signature events defined the dangerous
      complexity of the time in Suffolk. The first was the lengthy progress made through the heart
      and length of Suffolk and Norfolk by the queen in July and August 1578. Collinson has
      compellingly shown, in meticulous detail, that nothing whatsoever about this progress was
      random. Rather, its use of statecraft, selection of lodgings, spectacles, pageantry and
      performances, Protestant knightings and recusant shamings and finings were all meant, through
      a display of royal power, as a powerful rebuke to Catholic elements in both counties, so as to
      ensure peace in both the diocese of Norwich and greater East Anglia.<note type="foot">For a
       detailed analysis of the progress from this perspective, see Collinson, ‘Pulling the
       Strings,’ pp 122–41; MacCulloch, <title>Suffolk and the Tudors</title>, pp
      195–197.</note></p>

     <p>The second event, an upheaval between 1578 and 1585 that has come to be known as the 'Bury
      "stirs",' served as a check on radical protestantism. At the heart of the crisis was a
      constitutional dispute (grown ever more fraught following the dissolution of the abbey): who,
      in the absence of a local corporation, was to dominate governance in Bury? At that historical
      moment, three groups—religious conservatives (Catholics), conformist Protestant moderates, and
      radical reformist puritans—were competing for power. Bury had become the center of puritanism
      in West Suffolk and puritans were taking ever more control of the county’s judicial system.
      Their chief jurisdictional opponent in Bury was the bishop of Norwich (also representing the
      interests of the Crown), but they also faced serious local challenges from both conformist
      Protestants and Catholic interests. The political situation in late sixteenth-century Bury was
      almost impossibly complex. In the absence of a corporation or a powerful religious guild,
      administrative power in Bury lay with the town feoffees and the governors of Bury School,
      mainly representing conformist interests, although conservatives and moderates found it
      necessary to form an alliance against the puritans. Conflict during the stirs unfolded as a
      series of legal and judicial battles used largely as a means to punish and discipline
      opponents. Executions and demonizations of opponents resulted. Both the tenor and the
      factionalism in Bury reflect the larger currents in the county but were especially explosive
       there.<note type="foot">For essential analyses of the Bury stirs and their context, see
       Craig, <title>Reformation</title>, pp 72–114; MacCulloch, <title>Suffolk and the
        Tudors</title>, pp 192–219.</note></p>

     <p>During the rule of the two early Stuarts (1603 to 1642), Suffolk, like all of England, was
      firmly Protestant. However, the conflicts that had threatened Suffolk during the reign of
      Elizabeth (Catholics versus Protestants, and the Church of England versus Puritans) continued
      and, together with new difficulties, brought an irreconcilable hardening to matters of
      religion and politics.</p>

     <p>The thriving Elizabethan economy in Suffolk declined under the Stuarts. The once-robust
      cloth trade collapsed in the face of falling European demand, domestic export restrictions,
      and failure to respond to changing fashions abroad in the cloth trade. Fishing suffered from a
      post-Reformation decrease in demand for fish, foreign competition, and sea erosion in port
      towns. While agriculture boomed for food producers, workers suffered in poverty. While local
      grammar schools proliferated (former household clergy often serving as schoolmasters), the
      focus of education shifted from preparation for holy orders to preparation for law school.
      While literacy grew greatly among the gentry, yeomen, and tradesmen, most other folks remained
      illiterate—a situation contributing to the rise of a new ruling class. As a major maritime
      county, Suffolk became increasingly involved in the fraught issues of the day (war with Spain,
      foreign trade, emigration, colonization, and voyages of discovery). That is to say, the
      Suffolk of the early Stuarts was ‘precarious and turbulent,’ but never more so than in matters
      of religion and control of local order.<note type="foot">Dymond and Northeast, <title>History
        of Suffolk</title>, pp 67–73.</note> While identifiable Catholic recusants declined sharply
      in number during the early seventeenth century, they remained a social force in the county,
      mainly because of who they were. As Blackwood says, ‘Roman Catholic Recusancy was essentially
      seignorial’ under Elizabeth and the Stuarts, the greatest number of identifiable recusants
      being gentry, as well as some yeomen. The Howards, dukes of Norfolk; Sir <rs ref="eats:442216"
       type="Person_Male">Thomas Cornwallis</rs> of Brome, and the Jernegans of Somerlyton, among
      others, had been nationally important under Elizabeth. By 1641 a mere thirty-four identifiably
      recusant gentry families, all diminished by the Crown, remained in Suffolk. Recusants were
      mainly to be found, according to Joy Rowe, ‘in High Suffolk and the Liberty of St Edmund’ and
      ‘ along the valley of the River Waveney,’ but Blackwood notes that they were ‘practically
      non-existent in the Breckland, in Risbridge Hundred, in Ipswich and especially in the
       Sandlings.’<note type="foot">Blackwood, <title>Tudor and Stuart Suffolk</title>, pp 117–119;
       Joy Rowe in <title>England’s Long Reformation</title>, pp 169–70 and 178, quoted in
       Blackwood, <title>Tudor and Stuart Suffolk</title>, pp 119; Blackwood, <title>Tudor and
        Stuart Suffolk</title>, p 120.</note></p>

     <p>The struggle over order and control in early Stuart Suffolk was now between the Anglicans
      (Church of England) and the Puritans. Both were firmly protestant. As Patrick Collinson says,
      ‘the differences between Puritans and Anglicans were differences of degree, of theological
      temperature ... rather than of fundamental principle.’<note type="foot">Patrick Collinson,
        <title>The Elizabethan Puritan Movement</title> (London, 1967), 26–7, as quoted in
       Blackwood, <title>Tudor and Stuart Suffolk</title>, p 122.</note> Both factions believed in
      the fundamental tenets of protestant theology. The Puritans, however, passionately rejected
      the ceremonial and episcopal hierarchies retained by the Anglican church, which elements the
      Puritans judged to be residual Catholicism.</p>

     <p>Several factors strongly favored the Puritans in the struggle. First, East Anglia was a
      strongly Puritan region and, as MacCulloch says, Suffolk was ‘the heart of East Anglian
      Puritanism, where so many of the leading gentry were enthusiastic for radical
       reformation.’<note type="foot">Diarmaid MacCulloch, ‘Catholic and Puritan in Elizabethan
       Suffolk,’ <title>Archive for Reformation History</title> 72 (1981), p 283, quoted in
       Blackwood, <title>Tudor and Stuart Suffolk</title>, p 122.</note> Second, Puritans expressed
      a deeper commitment to their objections, perceiving Catholic vestiges as undermining
      Protestantism itself. Third, and most decisive, the gentry and the clergy of Puritan Suffolk
      struck an alliance, which has come to be known as ‘magistracy and ministry,’ that consolidated
      their power in governing the county. The Puritan clergy were generally learned, sincerely
      religious, and skilled in public speaking, and they were utterly opposed to ceremonial, to
      major prescriptions in the Prayer Book, and to the episcopal hierarchy. Jacobean Puritanism
      expressed minimal objections to the Crown, since it seemed so strongly Calvinist and supported
      the importance of preaching.<note type="foot">Blackwood, <title>Tudor and Stuart
        Suffolk</title>, pp 123–6.</note></p>

     <p>Most importantly, ‘the character of Puritanism changed’ in that it took ‘an inward turn,’
      becoming especially concerned about ‘household religion, sabbatarianism, and an emphasis on
      discipline, preaching and strict morality, especially the latter.’ Clergy were supported in
      their disciplinary efforts by the gentry, who appointed clergy, practiced household religion,
      were pietistic, held strong anti-episcopal feeling, and saw a decline of morality in the
      county. A kind of stifling probity took over and Puritan magistrates earnestly focused on
      matters of personal behaviour (the zealous punishing of minds, hearts, and bodies, in the name
      of good order).<note type="foot">Blackwood, <title>Tudor and Stuart Suffolk</title>, pp 126–7,
       132.</note></p>

     <p>While the Puritan magistracy and ministry worked relentlessly to complete the Reformation
      (as they saw it needed doing), their opponents, in the person of the Anglican bishops, were
      equally zealous in carrying out the opposing policies and religious positions of the Crown and
      the High Church. The bishops of Norwich countermanded Puritan actions, strengthened
      ceremonials, and did so in ways that severely alienated parishioners in the battle for hearts
      and minds. While the four bishops of the period (<rs ref="eats:452505" type="Person_Clergy"
       >Francis White</rs>, <rs ref="eats:429088" type="Person_Clergy">Richard Corbett</rs>, <rs
       ref="eats:305445" type="Person_Male">Matthew Wren</rs>, and <rs ref="eats:452584"
       type="Person_Clergy">Richard Montague</rs>) served to strengthen the Puritan mindset against
      the episcopacy, none had more negative impact than <rs ref="eats:305445" type="Person_Male"
       >Matthew Wren</rs>. In summary, he was unpleasant; was hated; held Armenian
      (anti-predestination) views; tactlessly espoused royal authority; imposed strict liturgical
      and doctrinal uniformity and conformity among clergy; was very ceremonial, anti-sabbatarian,
      and anti-preaching; was pro-catechizing; and suppressed lecturers. And he ordered the moving
      of the communion table further away from the congregation.<note type="foot">Blackwood,
        <title>Tudor and Stuart Suffolk</title>, pp 129–32.</note> However, the greatest difficulty
      facing Anglicans was the monarch himself, Charles I, who tried to finance his wars with
      excessive taxation, and dissolved his parliaments (the first time in 1626), imposing a
      personal rule that almost everyone found problematic.</p>

      <head>ALDEBURGH</head>

      <p>It can initially seem inexplicable that a charming but modest and remote little town on the
       Suffolk coast (as it now is) should have attracted repeated visits by royal troupes, plus
       eleven other nationally prominent acting companies, between 1567 and 1635. The answer, then
       and now, lies largely with the sea.</p>

      <p><rs ref="eats:366764" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Aldeburgh</rs> (in Plomesgate Hundred)
       rests very literally beside the sea between Orford and Dunwich on the River Alde, which was
       once navigable to Snape Bridge. Aldeburgh's fishermen used <hi rend="italic">batella</hi>
       (small five-man draggable boats) to navigate the Alde and other rivers and creeks into
       Aldeburgh, and for off shore fishing for coastal species. Originally the site of a small
       Roman port, Aldeburgh became, in the early modern period, 'an important port centred on a
       haven.' It had a significant shipbuilding industry and a substantial sprat (a small
       sardine-like fish) and line-fishing industry.<note type="foot">Birch, <title>Ancient
         Sites</title>, p 16; Bailey, <title>Medieval Suffolk</title>, pp 156, 164.</note> It
       received a borough charter in 1529, and from 1571 was one of seven Suffolk parliamentary
       boroughs, sending two members to parliament. The borough (reduced to a municipal corporation
       since 1832) was ‘governed by two bailiffs, ten capital burgesses, and twenty-four inferior
       burgesses.’ Its timber-framed <rs ref="eats:369614" type="Place_F_TownHall">Moot Hall</rs>,
       where those officials met, was built between 1520 and 1540.<note type="foot">Wendy Goult,

       1568. Land for a grammar school was incorporated in 1638. Its grammar school predated 1581,
       and in the seventeenth century the school recorded itself as having a 'school dame.' Its
       population, according to Blackwood, was 700 in 1524, and 1,300 in 1603. Its occupants
       included many sailors, mariners and maritime craftsmen.<note type="foot">Birch,

       performed), was built with wealth from its fishing and overseas trade in the fifteenth
       century. Aldeburgh, in short, was a significant borough during the sixteenth century, and
       easily accessible on coastal roads between Ipswich and Yarmouth. But it has proved to be
       extraordinarily vulnerable to the sea. As Birch has observed, in the sixteenth century it had
       five substantial streets running parallel to the sea. Today it has two. Its Moot Hall, which
       once stood in the Market Square at the centre of town now stands at the edge of the beach.
       Nor can the town move inland, given its geography.<note type="foot">Dymond and Northeast,

      <p><rs ref="eats:373096" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Beccles</rs> is situated on a rise
       overlooking the River Waveney in Wangford Hundred in northeast Suffolk, nearly equidistant
       between the towns of Bungay and Lowestoft. It is one of the oldest towns in Suffolk, and in
       earlier centuries was 'the most substantial [town] between Ipswich and Norwich.'<note

       Ipswich, it was one of two capitals of an Anglo-Saxon division in Suffolk called the Geldable
       (a place empowered to levy royal geld or taxes). Domesday Book confirms that it already had
       burgesses at the time of the Conquest. Beccles was one of eleven Suffolk towns that had a
       market and 'urban status,' and one of only six of those towns that had burgesses, though it
       never became a parliamentary borough. By virtue of its location at the farthest navigable
       point of the Waveney River, and because it was positioned on what was once ‘the main route
       from London to Yarmouth,’ it was always commercially significant. Its market dates from the
       Anglo-Saxon period. As early as the tenth century its thriving riverine port 'provided 60,000
       herring a year' for the abbey of Bury St Edmunds. In 1302 its market had eighty-two stalls,
       and partly because of its strategic position in the borderland between Suffolk and Norfolk,
       the market survived the general economic decline of the fifteenth century.<note type="foot"

      <p>Though important, Beccles was never large. In 1327 it ranked second among Suffolk towns,
       having 167 taxpayers. It had between 1,000 and 2,500 residents in the fourteenth century,
       1,200 in 1525, 1,100 in 1603, 1,750 in the 1670’s, and 2,000 by the end of the seventeenth
        century.<note type="foot">Blackwood, <title>Tudor and Stuart Suffolk</title>, p 5; and Evans

      <p>The abbey of Bury St Edmunds, which had acquired Beccles in the mid-tenth century, remained
       its landlord until 1536. At the time of the Conquest, the abbots took most customary rights
       due from Beccles market, and were given a charter to hold a fair in 1205, which charter was
       renewed in 1259.<note type="foot">Birch, <title>Ancient Sites</title>, pp 35–36.</note> As a
       ‘mesne’ or seignorial borough, Beccles developed a network of seven medieval religious guilds
       (Holy Ghost, St Michael, Ascension, Holy Trinity, Holy Name of Jesus and St Nicholas, Corpus
       Christi, and Halfpenny, the first six of which were housed in the guildhall). Those guilds
       effectively provided local governance.<note type="foot">Nesta Evans, <title>Beccles
         Rediscovered</title> (Beccles, 1984), 65; Bailey, <title>Medieval Suffolk</title>, p

       and before the Reformation assigned administration of those lands (including the game place)
       to the most important of its guilds, the Holy Ghost guild, which had been founded in the
       fifteenth century.<note type="foot">Evans, <title>Beccles Rediscovered</title>, 57–9, 65;
        Bailey, <title>Medieval Suffolk</title>, p 141.</note> The Holy Ghost guild protected the
       manorial lands from seizure by the Crown by creating the Lands Feoffment Trust, with the help
       of merchant William Rede. Although responsibility for the manorial lands had thereby devolved
       to the Trust after the dissolution, the town had to contend with Rede for ownership of the
       manorial lands until 1590. In 1584 a limited charter created the Corporation of Beccles,
       giving it the power to regulate the manorial lands of the fen. While the Corporation had no
       comparable formal power over the town, it essentially shaped the ways in which the town
       increasingly governed itself. The often overlapping membership of the Corporation (its
       portreeves) and the Lands Feoffment Trust (its thirteen feoffees) constituted a local ruling
        oligarchy.<note type="foot">Blackwood, <title>Tudor and Stuart Suffolk</title>, p 86; Evans,

      <p>Medieval and early modern Beccles had a contentious religious history that reflects the
       presence of competing social, cultural, and economic forces in the area. Beccles’ manorial
       landlords, the abbots of Bury St Edmunds, of course exerted great influence over the town (as
       described above). The parish church of <rs ref="eats:373119" type="Place_F_Church">St
        Michael</rs> in Beccles was built between 1350 and 1400. In addition to its seven religious
       guilds, pre-Reformation Beccles had a Hermitage Chapel dedicated to Mary, a leper’s hospital
       dedicated to St Mary Magdalene and St Anthony, and a medieval chapel dedicated to St Peter
       that was important to the fishermen of Beccles.<note type="foot">Goult, <title>A Survey of

       traditional religious presence. But at the same time most of Suffolk’s Lollards 'lived in or
       near the Waveney valley,' and Beccles and Bungay 'were considered the chief centres' of
       Lollard activity in the region. The presence of stone fonts depicting the sacraments in
       fourteen churches 'near former centres of East Anglian Lollardy' (including Bungay near
       Beccles) reflects the Orthodox church reacting to Lollard attacks on the sacraments, and
       three Lollards were burnt at the stake in Suffolk in the early sixteenth century (one from
       Bungay in 1511; one each from Eye and Earl Stonham between 1512 and 1515). During the Marian
       persecutions in 1556, three Protestants were burned at the stake in Beccles. Such evidence
       indicates a volatile combination of traditional Catholicism, Lollardy, and eventually Tudor
       Protestantism in Beccles.<note type="foot">Blackwood, <title>Tudor and Stuart
        Suffolk</title>, pp 69–70.</note> The politics of land ownership in Beccles with the
       aforesaid William Rede were no less contentious. For several decades following the
       dissolution, the town waged legal battles with Rede for control of the manorial lands
       (including the game place). The town finally won the contest in 1584 when a charter awarded
       the lands to the Corporation of Beccles Common. However, lordship of the Manor remained with
       the Redes and later with Sir Thomas Gresham (1519-79), founder of the Royal Exchange.<note

      <p>From the late thirteenth century forward, Babergh and Cosford Hundreds were the centre of

       According to Bailey, the growth of clothmaking intensified after the Black Death,
       particularly in 'rapidly industrializing villages,' including Boxford, in the Stour valley.
       In the 1460's Boxford ranked twelfth among cloth-making centres in Suffolk, becoming
       increasingly 'dominated by shearmen and weavers' in particular. By 1522, according to Dymond

       Elmham, close by the Waveney towns of Mettingham and Beccles. Nearly encircled by the River
       Waveney at a navigable point, Bungay has always been a strategically significant place. Roger

       Medieval Bungay had two parish churches (<rs ref="eats:373153" type="Place_F_Church">St

       fair, which existed before 1199 because in that year, ‘Hugh Bigot gained permission to extend
       the privileges of his fair,’ and two markets, and by 1565 a grammar school. Though
       substantial and important, Bungay, like other of Suffolk’s market towns, was never large. Its
       population has been estimated as 230 in 1086, 650 in 1524/5, 1,050 in 1603, and 1,200 in the
        1670’s.<note type="foot">Goult, <title>East Suffolk A–H</title>, np; Blackwood, <title>Tudor
         and Stuart Suffolk</title>, pp 5.</note> By the fourteenth century Bungay had become an
       important link in the river-shipping of grain on the Ouse and Waveney River system. It also
       received cattle driven by land for sale in the town and benefitted from the development of
       the dairying industry on the clays of north Suffolk. Some woollen and linen textile
       manufacturing developed here in the century or so after the Black Death.<note type="foot">
        Bailey, <title>Medieval Suffolk</title>, pp 169, 272.</note> During the seventeenth century
       the linen and sail cloth industry had concentrated in the Ouse and Waveney river valleys,
       bringing Bungay relief from earlier severe poverty that had been caused by waning of trade in
       the wake of continental wars. In spite of the powerful seignorial and spiritual presence of
       the abbey of Bury St Edmunds, religious protest appears always to have been part of the
       character of Bungay. Most of Suffolk’s Lollards 'lived in or near the Waveney valley,' and
       Beccles and Bungay 'were considered the chief centres' of Lollard activity in the region, and
       the area periodically experienced vehement and violent religious outbursts in opposition to
        sacramentalism.<note type="foot">Blackwood, <title>Tudor and Stuart Suffolk</title>, pp 21,

      <p>It would be impossible to overestimate the importance of both the <rs ref="eats:368503"

       historical embrace, as it were, that was seldom friendly and which the town found intolerably
       stifling.</p>

      <p>Historically, the town and the abbey developed simultaneously. It was the eleventh century
       that gave Bury its name, its medieval identity, and the beginnings of its vast importance. In
       1020 King Cnut founded a Benedictine monastery on the site, and in 1038 Beodericeworth became
       a fortified town named Byrig, although it increasingly came to be called by variations
       including the words St Edmund and Bury.<note type="foot">Birch, <title>Ancient Sites</title>,

       area known as the Liberty of St Edmund (comprising the large hundreds of Babergh, Blackbourn,
       Cosford, Lackford, Thedwestre, Thingoe, and Risbridge) formed the dowry of Cnut's wife Emma.
       Her son, Edward the Confessor (1042–66), granted the entire liberty to the abbey at Bury,
       making the abbot the wealthiest, most powerful landlord in the county. The Liberty of St
       Edmund eventually became West Suffolk, whose boundary with East Suffolk was 'the most potent
       line of demarcation within Suffolk.'<note type="foot">Statham, <title>Accounts of the
         Feoffees</title>, p xviii; McCullough, quoted in Blackwood, <title>Tudor and Stuart
         Suffolk</title>, p 33.</note></p>

      <p>In founding the town, King Cnut granted privileges associated with boroughs, including
       burgesses, a coroner, a great or county court, courts leet, and a major market. In doing so,
       the town of Bury became the capital of the Liberty of St Edmund, and the eventual capital of
       West Suffolk. Subsequent charters by Edward the Confessor, Stephen, and Henry I confirmed,
       and notably expanded, the original privileges granted abbey and town by Cnut. Following the
       invasion of 1066, eleventh-century Bury thrived under the Normans. However, while Cnut had
       granted the town the practical right (and financial responsibility) to carry out the duties
       of a borough, he had given the authority of a landlord over those rights to the abbey, an
       ownership reaffirmed by subsequent kings, making the town a mesne borough. The town might
       appoint a <rs ref="eats:456840" type="Collective_Office">bailiff</rs> or other officers, but
       it must seek the approval of the abbot, the cellarer, or the sacrist for its choices.
       Further, the town must pay rents and taxes levied by the abbey. The town would remain a
       non-parliamentary, non-chartered borough until the early seventeenth century, an arrangement
       that guaranteed the four centuries of conflict between abbey and town that would follow.<note

       charter by King Stephen exempted the borough from all taxation except that levied by the
       abbey. The town had a guild merchant, which gave rising influence to the alderman of that
       guild, although the guild itself was not allowed to develop into an incorporated body.<note

         Suffolk</title>, pp 138–9.</note> Yet the growth in importance and power of the town was
       dwarfed by that of the abbey, whose temporal power came from two factors. In Bailey's words:
       'The landed estates of the abbey of Bury St Edmunds dominated west Suffolk, and its
       additional judicial rights associated with the Liberty of St Edmund enabled the abbey to
       protect its interests effectively and to control the local political landscape with an iron
        grip.'<note type="foot">Bailey, <title>Medieval Suffolk</title>, p 34.</note> And as the
       keeper of the shrine of St Edmund, the abbey was a centre of incalcuable spiritual attraction
       for kings and pilgrims alike. Both the abbey and the town experienced financial difficulties
       during the twelfth century. The century ended with the abbot intensifying his efforts to
       control the town and its money, while the town devised schemes to grow its corporate power
       and fiscal independence, setting the periodically explosive pattern of the next two
        centuries.<note type="foot"> See Antonia Gransden, <title>A History of the Abbey of Bury St

      <p>The thirteenth century brought sustained development to town and abbey. During the first
       sixteen years of the century, ending with the signing of the Magna Carta and the death of
       King John, the town of Bury continued to grow as an important centre of textile manufacturing
       and trade. King John signed a charter reaffirming the abbot's absolute monopoly over markets
       in all of the vast Liberty of St Edmund, a monopoly that the abbot ruthlessly affirmed when
       necessary. However, prosperity also brought endless conflicts involving money and power that
       entangled abbey, town, king, papacy, and barons in constantly shifting demands and alliances.
       Bury's impressive and ever-growing resources also became it greatest vulnerability. A
       controversy between the abbot and the Crown concerning the right to select the next abbot
       (should the right belong to the king or to the abbey?) also caused serious conflict between
       factions within the Abbey. The burgesses of the town, as might be expected, sided with the
       king. Further, between 1212 and 1214 the king assessed 4,000 marks from the abbey in taxes,
       and in response the abbey taxed the town for that money. No party was endearing itself to any
       of the others in this permanently simmering pot of trouble.<note type="foot">Gransden,

        94–106.</note> The town's textile industry continued to produce fabric prized throughout the
       kingdom. The former guild merchant (now called the <rs ref="eats:371701"
        type="Collective_GuildsReligious">Candlemas guild</rs>) expanded its <rs ref="eats:373579"
        type="Place_F_GuildHall">guildhall</rs>. The town also had a cordwainers' guild. In 1264,
       with the town still chafing under the abbey's control, major riots broke out challenging the
       abbot's charter of 1194 (which had given primacy to the abbot's court over the borough
       court). Further, the young burgesses, demanding that the Candlemas Guild be recognized as a
       corporation guild, formed the guild of youth. They elected an alderman, set up a court, and
       restricted the power of the monks in town affairs, also attacking the abbey gates and
       assaulting monks. In the end, their efforts came to nothing when the Crown forced them to
       abandon their guild. Although the abbot was now by far the largest landlord in Suffolk, its
       status ensured by Crown and papacy alike, it literally fought all encroachments upon its
       temporal and spiritual power, notably by the mendicant orders who sought to establish
       themselves in the town and succeeded even though the town and secular clergy consistently
       sided with the mendicants. In the 1260's Henry III faced a major insurrection by the barons,
       who assaulted Norwich. When the abbey at Bury harboured the rebels and their loot, incurring
       the king's wrath, blame somehow fell from the abbey onto the alderman and burgesses, who were
       prosecuted, costing the town its recently acquired rights. To further his point, in 1272 the
       king held a parliament at Bury to punish the rebels involved in the Norwich assault,
       executing thirty-five of them.</p>

      <p>The essential point concerning the thirteenth century is that the town’s economic
       importance and wealth marched ahead of the abbey. In the eleventh and twelfth centuries, the
       town had existed to serve the abbey, but in the thirteenth century the development and growth
       of the town as an important centre of commerce and manufacture in its own right, and the
       consequent wealth and influence of the leading merchants, created tension between town and
       abbey: for freedom on the one hand, and for continued iron control on the other.</p>

      <p>For the town, the only thing worse than having one resident landlord was having two, both
       of them inclined to make rapacious demands. During his 35-year reign (1272–1307) Edward I
       visited Bury fifteen times (often with Queen Eleanor) and kept a permanent residence in the
       abbey. He significantly augmented the abbey's powers and wealth, appointing the sacrist as
       judge of the assizes, granting the abbey the view of weights and measures, awarding a fair to
       the abbot in 1272, and generally siding with the abbey in its disputes with the town.
       However, he also taxed the abbey mercilessly, mainly to finance his wars with France and
       Wales (in 1277, 1282, 1292, and 1294). Exacerbating the town's ever-growing resentments, the
       abbey several times passed those royal taxes along to it. In 1291, for example, the abbey
       levied a tax on the town to offset the 1,000 marks that it had been forced to pay the Crown.
       In 1295 the king levied a heavy war tax directly onto the town. In 1297 the king confiscated
       all the goods of the abbot and the town. In short, during the last thirty years of the
       thirteenth century, the town achieved minor concessions but little of substance in seeking
       its rights as a borough.</p>

      <p>During the fourteenth century, protests by the town against the abbey periodically and
       violently escalated. An uprising in 1305 achieved little. In 1327, seizing upon distractions
       provided by efforts to depose Edward II, 'the townsmen attacked and burnt many of the
       monastic buildings,' stealing records, muniments, gold, silver, vessels, vestments, plus
       other evidences of abbey control.<note type="foot">Dymond and Northeast, <title>History of
         Suffolk</title>, p 47; Norman Scarfe, <title>Suffolk in the Middle Ages</title>
        (Woodbridge, 1986), 68.</note> The rebellious burgesses and townsmen were eventually
       defeated (with many subsequent executions of burgesses), their revolt having had little
       permanent effect on the abbey's control of the town. During the Peasants Revolt of 1381,
       rebels again attacked the abbey muniment rooms, stealing documents and precious objects and
       summarily beheading the prior, the keeper of the abbey's court rolls, and a third man. This
       time however, their punishment was merely a fine of 2,000 marks and the ordered return of
       everything that they had stolen.<note type="foot">Gottfried, <title>Bury St Edmunds</title>,

      <p>In spite of upheavals (and the Black Death that struck mid-century, killing nearly half of
       the monks in the abbey), both the town and the abbey continued to grow in wealth and
       influence during the fourteenth century. The town is estimated to have had between 5,000 and
       7,000 persons in the early fourteen century, its population notable for the large number of
       specialist craftsmen in the industrial processes of the textile trades. Through the Abbey's
       power, which suppressed all competing markets within eight miles of the town, Bury had become
       one of the two 'most dominant' towns in the county.<note type="foot">Bailey, <title>Medieval
         Suffolk</title>, pp 128–9; Dymond and Northeast, <title>History of Suffolk</title>, p
        46.</note> It had at least eighteen religious guilds, including the powerful Candlemas guild
       (the former guild merchant), and a handful trade and craft guilds, including the <rs
        ref="eats:371554" type="Collective_GuildsOccupational">weavers</rs> (which supported the
       Corpus Christi pageant and procession), the linen drapers, and the shoemakers. The town used
       its religious and craft guilds to create structures providing religious, communal, and
       commercial authority that was at least nominally independent of the Abbey.<note type="foot"
        >Amor, <title>From Wool to Cloth</title>, pp 137-41;
        Bailey, <title>Medieval Suffolk</title>, pp 138–41.</note> Yet, the town remained a mesne
       borough, seemingly forever doomed to be economically and civically subject to the abbey.</p>

      <p>For its part, the abbey remained 'comfortably the county's most powerful and dominant
       landlord,' far greater than Suffolk 's three other major landlords—the earls of Norfolk,
       Suffolk, and Clare. The influence of its presence was incalculable. As described by Dymond
       and Northeast, the abbey remained 'the centre of a major pilgimage, it entertained kings and
       queens, housed parliaments, [and] built up a famous manuscript library with over 2,000
       volumes,' and may have hosted a meeting leading 'to the granting of Magna Carta.' It exerted
       ultimate authority over every aspect of the town of Bury's life—its courts, markets, rents,
       guilds, and bailiffs, thereby perpetuating a 'notoriously fractious' relationship.<note
        type="foot">Bailey, <title>Medieval Suffolk</title>, pp 16, 34, 137; Dymond and Northeast,
         <title>History of Suffolk</title>, p 39.</note> In spite of its huge income, the abbey
       continually felt financial pressures, which did not ease in the post plague era when land
       values fell yet wages and costs rose. In this pre-Reformation world, the dramatic records of
       the town and the abbey indicate a bifurcated local culture unlike any that appears in other
       of Suffolk's dramatic records: apparently, neither town or abbey contributed much at all to
       the performance or customary culture of the other.</p>

      <p>Between the mid-fifteenth and the early sixteenth centuries, the profound social, economic,
       and religious turmoil affecting Bury mirrored those affecting society as a whole. Cade's
       Rebellion in 1450 drew major support from textile workers in Bury, as it did from other of
       Suffolk's textile manufacturing towns.<note type="foot">Bailey, <title>Medieval
         Suffolk</title>, p 192.</note> At the same time, Bury's (and greater Suffolk's)
       agricultural and industrial/commercial economy thrived between 1450 and 1530. The cloth
       industry 'reached a major peak of prosperity, and especially so in the main broadcloth area
       of south Suffolk—roughly a triangle with points at Clare, Bury St Edmunds and East Bergholt.'
       During these eighty years, Bury's cloth-production ranked third, after Hadleigh and Lavenham,
       among Suffolk towns (although it would lose its primacy in the early seventeenth century
       because of its failure to respond to changing fashions).<note type="foot">Dymond and
        Northeast, <title>History of Suffolk</title>, pp 51–2, 67.</note> Trade and craft guilds
       formed the heart and core of Bury's civic life throughout the entire Middle Ages, but never
       more so than during this late medieval period. As summarized by Bailey, Bury used trade,
       craft, and even religious guilds to organize commercial activity that was free from abbey
       control. The weavers and linen drapers regulated textiles; the bakers and shoemakers exerted
       similar control in their respective areas of interest. The weavers produced the Corpus
       Christi pageant and procession. Most powerful was the Candlemas guild (the former guild
       merchant), based in St James Church: 'By the end of the fifteenth century the gild merchant
       had acquired sufficient legal standing to allow burgesses to act as a communal body.' In this
       use of its guilds as its central instruments of governance (lacking, as they did, a formal
       government) Bailey finds Bury to be unique (save for Beccles) among Suffolk towns.<note
        type="foot">Bailey, <title>Medieval Suffolk</title>, pp 140–41.</note> Conversely however,
       while the abbey remained 'the fifth wealthiest Benedictine house in England,' it experienced
       a sharp decline of income during its final eight decades of existence. As described by
       Bailey, its financial difficulties included major decreases in charitable donations, in
       income from spiritualities, in bequests by wealthy clothiers and others, and in its inability
       to increase the number or value of its estates.<note type="foot">Blackwood, <title>Tudor and
         Stuart Suffolk</title>, p 76; Bailey, <title>Medieval Suffolk</title>, p 257.</note></p>

      <p>The sixteenth century was, of course, catastrophic for the abbey, culminating in its
       dissolution on 4 November 1539 and the simultaneous abolishing of the rights and powers of
       the Liberty of St Edmund. The many payments to royal and other important troupes in the abbey
       records in the quarter century before the dissolution testify to the ever-increasing
       intensity of the Crown's gaze, and the reclaiming of power to itself from the church and the
        nobility.<note type="foot">Dymond and Northeast, <title>History of Suffolk</title>, p
        60.</note>The Crown, together with the barons, proved no less demanding and controlling a
       landlord than had the abbey. Bury would remain a seignorial, non-chartered borough until the
       early seventeenth century.</p>

      <p>Although it lacked the legal right to run its own affairs free of the abbot’s control, the
       town developed a series of structural entities that enabled its leading citizens to operate
       with greater independence from the abbey. The process had begun in the mid-fifteenth century
       when local benefactor John (also known as Jankyn) Smith provided funding for what might be
       called administrative charities used to protect the town's hard-earned customs. The process
       continued to evolve with a charter in 1470 between the abbot and alderman confirming the
       customs identified in Smith's will, as well as a body of greater and lesser burgesses. Two
       years later, in 1472, new statutes gave the Candlemas guild (composed of both men and women)
       the right to administer these customs after the death of the early benefactors, thereby
       providing the town with protections against future abbots. The town also established other
       quasi-administrative customs as well. Even though the Candlemas guild was officially
       abolished mid-century (as were other chantries and guilds), it continued to operate as a
       crypto-governing body throughout the early seventeenth century, electing an alderman,
       managing the guildhall (which the town now owned), and financially supporting a clerk,
       porter, chaplain, sexton, cook, and preacher. A book of orders codified the rules and
       processes guiding the town's governance. As described by Statham, the town appears to have
       developed a tripartite structure (comprised of the Company, the Common Conference, and the
       Feoffees of the town lands) that provided it with a practical way to govern the community,
       including the management of building projects and care of the poor.</p>

      <p>The town finally achieved its long-sought goal when it received three corporation charters
       from the Crown in the early seventeenth century. A charter on 3 April 1606 described them as
       a new corporation with an alderman, twelve capital burgesses, twenty-four burgesses of the
       common council, four justices of the peace, a recorder, a town clerk, and two sergents at
       mace, while still withholding several important privileges. A second charter, given on 1 July
       1608 in the wake of a fire that had devastated the town, provided for rebuilding and
       restoration by awarding the remaining financial powers sought by the town—control of ‘tithes,
       fairs, markets, and glebe lands.’ A third charter, in July 1614, gave the town control of
       quarter sessions and leet courts, a coroner, the right to four maces, churches with their
       advowsons (the right to select clergy), and above all in its importance, the right to send
       two members to parliament. The town had arrived.<note type="foot">Statham, <title>Accounts of

      <head>DUNWICH</head>

      <p>For centuries, the ill-fated town of <rs ref="eats:373969" type="Place_PA_Settlement"
        >Dunwich</rs>, in Blything Hundred, on the east coast of Suffolk fought against the
       relentless onslaught of the North Sea. However, by 1740 what had been described as a city in
       803 AD (rather optimistically), a borough with 120 burgesses in 1066, a chartered borough
       with a merchant guild in 1200, and a place with a large, ancient port and major fishing
       industry, had been reduced to a small hamlet, its many substantial buildings lying beneath
       the encroaching waves. In spite of the ceaseless erosion, in the age of Shakespeare Dunwich
       was still a thriving, if struggling, borough and a minor, but lucrative, port. Important
       professional acting companies, including Shakespeare’s own troupe, still found reason to
       perform there.</p>

      <p>Dunwich's unparalleled reversal is of such an epic scale that the town has been called 'the
       English Atlantis.' It was always an important place. Founded on the site of an earlier Roman
       settlement in <hi rend="italic">c</hi> 632 by St Felix, who made the town his seat, Dunwich
       grew into the ancient capital of East Anglia. Its college and seminary, founded by Felix, was
       the 'oldest school in English history.' Before the Conquest, it was 'the principal fishing
       port in Suffolk,' with a deep-water harbour.<note type="foot"> Blackwood, <title>Tudor and
         Stuart Suffolk</title>, p 25; Birch, <title>Ancient Sites</title>, p, 108; Dymond and

         A–H</title>, np.</note></p>

      <p>Dunwich rivaled Ipswich in its early importance. The town's defining development occurred
       during the eleventh and twelfth centuries under the Normans, who recognized its strategic
       importance. Its population in 1086 was 628 recorded people. In 1173 it had been heavily
       fortified with a ditch and massive rampart, and as a royal demesne and mint under Henry II,
       the town and port flourished.<note type="foot">Dymond and Northeast, <title>History of
         Suffolk</title>, p 36; Birch, <title>Ancient Sites</title>, p, 109.</note> It received its
       first charter as a free borough from King John in 1199, with considerable civic autonomy as a
       royal borough, and by the late twelfth century it had a daily market and numerous religious
       institutions. The ‘road into town from the south eroded away by sea [in] 1609,’ and an
       east-west road ran from Dunwich to Bury St Edmunds.<note type="foot">Goult, <title>East
         Suffolk A–H</title>, np.</note></p>

      <p>At its peak in the thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries, Dunwich was an impressive
       place. It had at least seven churches (plus four lost churches), six rectories, a Saxon
       monastery, a Benedictine cell to Eye Priory, a preceptory of the Knights Templar, two
       convents—of the Black Friars and the Grey Friars, two hospitals, many almshouses, and four or
       more manors. It maintained eleven ships of war, sixteen fair ships, twenty barks and other
       vessels, and it engaged in North Sea and Icelandic trade. In 1334 it had fifty-four shops and
       four bakeries.<note type="foot">Goult, <title>East Suffolk A–H</title>, np.</note> In the
       thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries Dunwich was still one of Suffolk's largest towns
       with a population estimated to have been between 1,000 and 2,500 persons, but it had
       'suffered badly from a silting harbour and catastrophic marine inundations,' losing a
       documented six parishes, 600 buildings, and its harbour mouth during a period of frequent and
       extreme storm activity between the 1290s and the 1340s.<note type="foot">Bailey,
         <title>Medieval Suffolk</title>, p 128.</note> From the mid-fourteenth through the
       fifteenth centuries, a litany of factors, notably its relentless battering by the sea, and
       the wake of the Black Death, accelerated Dunwich's continuing decline. The borough’s revenue
       base shrank, its 'fishing fleet slumped, the income from its market stalls fell by two
       thirds, and the borough faced recurrent financial crises,' as its population shrank and it
       faced fierce competition for trade along the east coast from Southwold, Walberswick and
        Aldeburgh.<note type="foot">Bailey, <title>Medieval Suffolk</title>, pp 134, 264–5, 277,
        281–2.</note></p>

      <p>Sixteenth-century Dunwich was increasingly a ghostly shadow of its earlier self. Except for
       similarly sea-challenged Aldeburgh, Dunwich was the only Suffolk town with a shrinking
       population, going from 1,150 residents in 1524/5 to 850 in 1603 to 300 in the 1670's. From
       the 1570's to the 1590's, the number of vessels held by its port were reduced by decade from
       fourteen vessels to ten to seven, and ‘by the end of the sixteenth century,’ the port was
       ‘completely blocked.’<note type="foot">Blackwood, <title>Tudor and Stuart Suffolk</title>, p

      <p><rs ref="eats:369522" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Ipswich</rs> is the county city of
       Suffolk, and (it is today claimed) 'the first known town in Britain since the Roman period.'
       Its geographically strategic position on the River Gipping—which becomes the Orwell at 'the
       spot where it becomes tidal' lies 'some twelve miles from the open sea with direct access to
       mainland Europe'—determined that Ipswich must become a major port. Indeed, Anglo-Saxon
       Ipswich is thought to be 'the largest known early trading community in north-west Europe.' As
       Dymond and Northeast note, by the late sixth century the port was engaging in trade with the
       Low Countries and the Rhineland.<note type="foot"> Dymond and Northeast, <title>History of
         Suffolk</title>, pp 33–4; Wade, quoted in Dymond and Northeast, <title>History of
         Suffolk</title>, p 34.</note> Close as it is by the royal town of Rendlesham, and by Sutton
       Hoo, early Anglo-Saxon Ipswich had craftsmen skilled in metal-working, weaving, fishing, and
       pottery making, and it had a royal mint by 925. However, the strength of its geographical
       position was also the town's greatest vulnerability. In 885 the fleet of King Alfred won a
       decisive victory at Ipswich against the Danes, but invading Viking fleets then won three
       successive victories—by Olaf (with 93 ships) in 991, Thurkell the Tall in 1010, and Cnut in
       1016. In 1069 an army led by Norman barons defeated a final Viking invasion, led by Sweyn of
        Denmark.<note type="foot">Birch, <title>Ancient Sites</title>, pp 214–216.</note> As a
       result of those many invasions, the Normans found the previously flourishing borough of
       Ipswich in a despoiled, impoverished, state. However, under Norman control and driven by the
       eventual revival of its shipbuilding, trade and commerce, Ipswich began what would become 450
       years of sometimes interrupted, but never permanently broken, growth and revival.</p>

      <p>During the late twelfth and thirteenth centuries the essential features of what would
       become the permanent civic identity of Ipswich developed. In 1200 it received a foundational
       corporation charter from King John, which, as described by Geoffrey Martin, gave it, in
       perpetuity, these much coveted rights as a royal borough: freedom of tolls throughout all of
       the king's lands; perpetual hold of the borough; a guild merchant or hanse; a protective
       trade association; exemption from the billeting of royal officers; protection from impleading
       outside the borough; permanent possession of its own free customs and the choice of its own
       magistrates; two <rs ref="eats:402653" type="Collective_Office">bailiffs</rs> and four
       coroners; and overseeing of the processes of justice. The town promptly elected twelve chief
        <rs ref="eats:423221" type="Collective_Office">portmen</rs> (as governors), two beadles or
        <rs ref="eats:414953" type="Collective_Office">sergeants</rs>; devised a common seal; and
       appointed an alderman and four associates of the <rs ref="eats:401738"

       immediately set about to write two rolls that would become the earliest known borough
       records—the one being the laws and customs of the town (which they called Domesday), the
       other being the rules or ordinances of the merchant guild (notably recording the guild's
       control of admissions to the borough). As Geoffrey Martin astutely observes, the burgesses
       could not have won the royal ratification of their liberties without a civic organization
       already in place that was substantially the same as that decreed under licence in 1200. That
       is, the institutions and customs of the town had been operating long before the charter of
       1200. A surviving roll of 1255–6 shows that the principal court of the borough (the
       portmanmote) was already established well before that time. A charter from Henry III in 1256
       further expanded the rights and independence of the town. As of 1298 Ipswich had also become
       a parliamentary borough.<note type="foot">Martin, 'Governance,' pp xix–xxii; Blackwood,

      <p>The guild merchant is central in Ipswich history because of its early role in both local
       governance and the production of town-sponsored drama and ceremony. As John Wodderspoon
       explains it, early on Norman Ipswich developed a customary trade association now remembered
       as 'the old Hanse' to manage its foreign commerce. In effect, the Hanse acted as a
       guild-merchant-without-charter. When the town received its corporation charter from King John
       in 1199 (with the granting of a guild merchant, aldermen, and common council), the town took
       immediate steps to turn those new liberties into fact, absorbing the old Hanse into a new
       guild merchant. Especially early on, the new guild merchant acted as 'an informal town
       government,' its leading officers serving as a 'a de facto town council.'<note type="foot"
        >John Wodderspoon, <title>Memorials of the Ancient Town of Ipswich in the County of
         Suffolk</title> (Ipswich and London, 1850), 157–8; Bailey, <title>Medieval Suffolk</title>,
        p 139.</note> For the next 125 years the guild merchant would function, although with
       decreasing centrality, as part of civic governance, notably in its power to admit burgesses
       and collect monies. However, in 1325, impelled by the new feast of Corpus Christi (instituted
       by Rome in 1264), and the urgings of the local clergy, the town changed the name of the guild
       merchant to the <rs ref="eats:402310" type="Collective_GuildsReligious">Corpus Christi
        guild</rs>. The guild's new constitution transformed it into the town's principal
       socio-religious guild, or confraternity, with responsibility for the town's three-day Corpus
       Christi celebration, including its new Corpus Christi procession, pageants, plays,
       ceremonies, and dinner or feast. The guild's mission, in short, was to unify the town in
       spiritual terms that emphasized the imminence of Christ and the actualizing of his life in
       the streets of Ipswich, and to instill a sense of universal spiritual community in the hearts
       of the laity.<note type="foot">Wodderspoon, <title>Memorials</title>, pp 155–7, 161–80;
        Martin, 'Governance,' p xxv.</note> The guild achieved its goals by overseeing the
       awe-inspiring spectacle of the procession and shows (intended to inspire the faithful and
       subdue the faithless, as it were). Multiple entries in the town's books between 1444 and 1546
       record the activities of the guild, from the appointment of the guild's schoolmaster to the
       Corpus Christi celebration to the managing of the guild's monies and properties. From the
       1550s forward the records simply refer to the body as 'The Guild.' Later civic accounts tend
       to refer to the annual feast and elections as 'The Guild.' By 1627 the guild had reverted
       even further back, once again styling itself 'The Guild Merchant.'</p>

      <p>The Corpus Christi guild operated at the direction of the Great Court of all the freemen
       (also called the General Court), which was the city's 'administrative authority' (paralleling
       the city's chief 'judicial authority,’ the portmanmote). The Great Court made ordinances
       concerning 'all aspects of town government,' including the election of the bailiffs,
       coroners, treasurer, chamberlains, and other officials. The Great Court itself acted on
       recommendations made by the Assembly, a body comprising the bailiffs, twelve portmen, and the
       twenty-four members of the common council. Among its manifold duties, the Great Court also
       supervised the annual election of the officers of the Corpus Christi guild, including the
       guild's <rs ref="eats:406011" type="Collective_Office">alderman</rs>, its four <rs
        ref="eats:403996" type="Collective_Office">wardens</rs>, and the wardens of specific
       pageants. The Great Court also appointed certain freemen of the city to guard the
       pageants.</p>

      <p>When electing the alderman of the Corpus Christi guild, the Great Court also approved his
       two associates. The four wardens of the guild, who worked at the direction of the alderman,
       were elected from among the commonality of burgesses, and usually never served twice. Until
       1545 the guild wardens numbered four; thereafter they usually numbered two. The alderman and
       wardens handled the guild's business (organizing the election of officers; managing finances;
       and organizing the annual dinner, known as the feast).</p>

      <p>Ipswich was always 'a community of merchants and sailors and a town noted for its
       independent spirit and corporate pride in its privileges.' During the fourteenth and
       fifteenth centuries Ipswich further secured and extended those privileges through
       confirmations in a succession of royal charters (five in the fourteenth century, one each in
       1446 and 1463). It had 'the best harbour and most accessible estuary' in Suffolk, and most of
       Suffolk's exported and imported goods made their way through Ipswich, notably 'wine, ale,
       herrings, hides, linen and canvas cloth, wool, millstones and salt.' It was a major
       commercial distribution centre, and had a daily market of its own. By 1334, Ipswich had
       become one of three Suffolk towns ranked 'among the … wealthiest [towns] in England.'<note
        type="foot">Blackwood, <title>Tudor and Stuart Suffolk</title>, p 43; Bailey,
         <title>Medieval Suffolk</title>, pp 128–130, 150.</note> The town continued to grow,
       surpassing Bury as the most populous town in the county, its population estimated as between
       5,000 and 7,000 people in the fourteenth century. In the wake of successive outbreaks of
       plague, it became a magnet for persons migrating in from the devastated countryside, even
       though the plague struck in Ipswich too. Ipswich was also 'the centre of the county's
       administration and system of justice.' According to Dymond, Ipswich and Bury were the only
       two towns in the county strongly associated with craft or trade guilds (although an incident
       in Bungay in 1514 involving its pageants suggests a craft guild presence in that town as
        well).<note type="foot">Bailey, <title>Medieval Suffolk</title>, pp 129–30, 161, 150; Dymond
        and Northeast, <title>History of Suffolk</title>, p 60.</note> Guilds of that kind were
       particularly numerous in Ipswich. In 1400 forty-one crafts in six companies took part in the
       Ipswich Corpus Christi procession.</p>

      <p>In the mid-fifteenth century a great economic depression brought on in large part by
       foreign wars left Ipswich (and many other towns) impoverished; its all-important common quay
       was in 'partial decay.' As Bailey says, this catastrophe caused 'harsh competition in a
       contracting market' between Ipswich and Bury. However, within twenty years Ipswich had
       recovered and surpassed its earlier strengths. As described by Nicholas Amor, by 1470 the
       economy was recovering and its administrative system had mushroomed. In addition to the
       bailiffs, portmen, chamberlains and council of twenty-four it now included: ‘two escheators,
       six justices of the peace, four clavigers, a clerk of the peace, a common clerk, two
       additional sergeants, a master and six sub-porters [,] … and four wardens of the Corpus
       Christi guild.' 'Residents served as assessors and collectors,’ and (as summarized by Amor)
       as jurors valuers, chief pledges, tithingmen and affeerors, overseers of markets, and wine
       drawers. While Ipswich still had to contend with three magnates in the county (the dukes of
       Suffolk and Norfolk, and the earl of Oxford), the town had become 'the head port of a
       jurisdiction that stretched from Orford Haven to Brightingsea and included the harbours of
       Colchester (via its outport of Hythe), Harwich and Maldon.'<note type="foot">Bailey,
         <title>Medieval Suffolk</title>, p 265; Nicholas R. Amor, <title>Late Medieval Ipswich:
         Trade and Industry</title> (Woodbridge, 2011), 18–19.</note></p>

      <p>The Reformation immediately took firm hold in Ipswich, eventually transforming the town. By
       1530 Ipswich had a 'strong Protestant presence,' likely (in Blackwood's view) 'because of the
       port's trading contacts with the Low Countries.' In 1556 Marian supporters identified
       ninety-eight residents (among them five clergy) as Protestant, and '[u]nder Elizabeth I
       Ipswich would become the capital of Protestantism, indeed of Puritanism, in Suffolk.'<note
        type="foot">Blackwood, <title>Tudor and Stuart Suffolk</title>, p 101.</note> During the
       brief Catholic interlude of the Marian reign, three Protestant martyrs were burned at the
        stake.<note type="foot">Birch, <title>Ancient Sites</title>, p 221.</note></p>

      <p>The tumult of the times changed every other aspect of Ipswich life as well. By 1524 a
       thriving Ipswich had become 'the sixth wealthiest provincial town in England.' However, the
       town's fortunes drastically reversed between the 1520's and 1560. Wars damaged trade and the
       cloth markets, leading to over-production in the wake of receding markets. Those markets,
       agrarian change, and the redistribution of wealth caused by the dissolution of the
       monasteries led to industrial unemployment, severe poverty, and what Geoffrey Martin calls
       'structural destitution.'<note type="foot">Birch, <title>Ancient Sites</title>, p 215;
        Martin, 'Governance,' p xxviii.</note> The town responded to this crisis with many positive
       steps. Using its charitable foundations and taxing strategies in the 1570's, the town began
       its efforts to recover, purchasing defunct properties and developing ‘an infirmary,
       almshouse, house of correction,’ and a hospital to address the suffering of its citizens and
       the new realities of life in Ipswich.<note type="foot">Martin, 'Governance,' pp xxviii,
        xxx.</note> It enriched the charter of the grammar school. Through its efforts, its markets
       and trade began to recover.</p>

      <p>However, this new environment brought structural and cultural changes to governance in
       Ipswich. Driven by necessity and the sense of social obligation felt by the 'godly Puritan
       elite' that controlled the town, borough government greatly expanded it numbers and its
       powers to meet the physical needs of the community. In this reformist environment the justice
       system also felt an increasing need to order 'the religious and moral lives of the
       inhabitants,' doing so with severe policing and punishments including public shaming,
       carting, and the pillory.<note type="foot">Martin, 'Governance,' pp xxix–xxxii.</note> Other
       than these spectacles, public performance increasingly included only civic ceremonies, music
       by the <rs ref="eats:406229" type="Collective_Office">town waits</rs>, and visits by royal
       troupes (who could not be shunned). Most strikingly, in this environment the independent
       spirit and universal enfranchisement that had characterized governance in Ipswich
       increasingly gave way to 'government by oligarchy,' conducted by a 'self-perpetuating elite'
       made up of wealthy merchants, lawyers, gentry, wine traders, and cloth producers.<note

      <head>SUDBURY</head>

      <p><rs ref="eats:366577" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Sudbury</rs>, in Babergh Hundred and
       Sudbury Deanery in southwest Suffolk, is one of Suffolk's oldest towns and a very ancient
       urban site. It is strategically located on the route north from Essex to Bury St Edmunds and
       at a crossing point of the River Stour, latterly navigable by barges to Sudbury. It was a
       Saxon royal town and a minster, had a royal mint from the tenth through the twelfth
       centuries, and was already a borough at the time of the Conquest.<note type="foot">Birch,
         <title>Ancient Sites</title>, p 367; Bailey, <title>Medieval Suffolk</title>, p 2.</note>
       In 1086 Domesday described it as having ‘sixty-three burgesses dwelling by the hall and
       fifty-five others dwelling on the demesne,’ and well before 1274 it had a <rs
        ref="eats:436957" type="Collective_Office">mayor</rs> and a ruling council (<rs
        ref="eats:436994" type="Collective_Office">aldermen</rs>, burgesses, sergeants, bailiff, and

      <p>Between the thirteenth and sixteenth centuries the key to Sudbury's success was its canny
       adaptability, both in cloth-making and politics. As skillfully outlined by Mark Bailey, by
       1200 Sudbury was one of England's significant cloth-making towns, mainly in 'higher quality
       cloths for a wealthy clientele' and by 1300 it was one of Suffolk's three main textile
       manufacturing centres.<note type="foot">Bailey, <title>Medieval Suffolk</title>, pp 158, 275,
        269.</note> Its expertise enabled it to prosper during the tumult of the mid-fourteenth
       century, responding rapidly to the growing demand for textiles among the lower orders of
       society: Sudbury weaving peaked between the 1350s and 1370's. A number of scholars make
       similar observations concerning Sudbury's flourishing economy from the fourteenth through the
       early sixteenth centuries.<note type="foot">See Birch, <title>Ancient Sites</title>, pp
        367–9; Dymond and Northeast, <title>History of Suffolk</title>, pp 52, 67; Bailey,

        p 5.</note> In spite of Sudbury's major role in the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, Sudbury
       cloth-manufacturing continued to flourish in the face of a more general economic downturn
       between the 1390s and 1420s During the fifteenth century, Sudbury was one of the most
       productive cloth-making towns in Suffolk, ranking seventh among Suffolk towns in cloth
       manufacture. Unlike other important cloth-making towns which failed to respond to changing
       times in the sixteenth century, Sudbury shifted to lighter, more colourful fabrics, and did
       well. In 1524 it ranked seventh among Suffolk towns in taxable wealth and was the fifth most
       populous town in the county with 1,200 inhabitants.</p>

      <head>WALSHAM LE WILLOWS</head>

      <p>Medieval <rs ref="eats:386439" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Walsham</rs> was not a town or
       borough, but a large, populous village in Blackbourn Hundred, West Suffolk, with a
       flourishing cultural and religious life more characteristic of towns than of villages. It
       lies a roughly equidistant ten miles (moving clockwise) from Diss in Norfolk, Stowmarket,
       Bury, and Thetford. It is five miles from Ixworth, and Walsham's main west-to-east street is
       part of the Ixworth to Finningham Road. The village has other roads to numerous villages.
       That is to say, it was (and is) well situated to engage in the agricultural commerce and
       inter-parish enterprise that was, and remains, its principal enterprise. At the same time, it
       had a diverse and skilled employment base that included yeomen, husbandmen, cloth workers,
       shearmen, tanners, and the like. Walsham's <rs ref="eats:386503" type="Place_F_Church">Church
        of St Mary</rs> is centrally located at the intersection of its main street and Church Way.
       The pre-Reformation village had four religious guilds: Blessed Virgin Mary, St Trinity
       (1446), St John Baptist (1446), and St Catherine (1521), and a guildhall. Its population was
       listed as sixty-one residents in 1086, ninety taxpayers in 1283, twenty-two taxpayers in
       1327, sixty-seven taxpayers in 1524, 4-600 persons in 1577, and 3-400 adults in 1603.<note
        type="foot">Ray Lock, ‘The Black Death in Walsham-le-Willows,’ Proceedings of the Suffolk
        Institute of Archaeology and History (1992), 317; Wendy Goult, <title>West Suffolk</title>,

        Gilds,’ <title>Proceedings of the Suffolk Institute of Archaeology</title> 19 (1925–6),
        207.</note></p>

      <p>Lock describes Walsham as lying within 'an area of dense and wealthy population.' On the
       eve of the Black Death in 1349, the population of Walsham was greater than at any time before
       or since, but between March and June of 1349 the pandemic killed half the parish’s
       population. Walsham’s population would never again exceed its pre-plague numbers. The
       short-term effects of the Black Death were dire, with poverty among survivors and many
       tenements and messuages abandoned, but the manorial and religious institutions remained
       intact and economic and social life soon adapted and recovered.</p>

      <p>Walsham Manor passed to a succession of landlords through the centuries, absorbing
       sub-manors as time passed. During the years which saw the generation of records related to
       the <rs ref="eats:386537" type="Place_F_OpenArea">Walsham game place</rs>, the lords of
       Walsham Manor were <rs ref="eats:170753" type="Person_Male">George Talbot</rs>, seventh earl
       of Shrewsbury (lord from 1497), <rs ref="eats:139229" type="Person_Male">Charles
       Brandon</rs>, duke of Suffolk (from 1533), and Sir Nicholas Bacon (from 1581).</p>

      <p>Walsham earned a place in this collection because of one cluster of records, all having to
       do with its famous game place. Of Walsham, one wonders if there is something detectable in
       its records that might explain why, among more than 500 Suffolk parishes, it would have one
       of Suffolk's three confirmed, purpose-built, medieval outdoor playing places (plus one of the
       innumerable other outdoor recreational sites dotting the countryside)? If so, that something
       is hard to pinpoint with certainty.</p>

      <p>Lock describes Walsham as an 'unremarkable’ place in that it had no great religious house,
       no noble family, no industrial development, and no cataclysmic political events. The lords of
       its three manors appear to have exercised no absolute hegemonic control over the village.
       Those qualities may offer some clues as to why Walsham might have had a site used only for
       plays. Though nominally a village, Walsham acted like a town, governed by its laity and
       religious guilds. In 1496 and 1497 the owner of the land that included Walsham's camping
       close and playing site gave that land to the church of Walsham to be used, for its benefit,
       by the guild of the Blessed Virgin Mary and by the other guilds of the parish.<note
        type="foot">In 1505–6 Thetford Priory paid 16d 'in regard to Walsham game et Gyslyngham,'
        likely when the two parishes came to Thetford to announce a play and seek support. The
        wording of the entry is less than clear, but it appears to be saying that the play was to be
        produced at Walsham, and that Gislingham was co–producing or otherwise assisting with it.
        The famous Rickinghall Fragment (see <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid7/"
         >abbey of Bury St Edmunds records text for 1369–70</ref>) is a snippet of dialogue in
        Norman French and English from a history play surviving on a fragment of manorial court
        roll. So we can know that at least three of the villages edging Allwood Green had drama and
        that two of them certainly collaborated with each other in that enterprise. The five
        parishes also shared common grazing provided by Allwood Green, another indication of their
        ties and understandings. All five also had medieval guildhalls. The only other indications
        of Walsham's early entertainments—the surrender of a rood of land at the Maypole in 1318 and
        a ploughale in 1392—further indicate festive customary entertainments by the laity in
        Walsham (Birch, <title>Ancient Sites</title>, pp 131, 158, 320–21; Lock, <title>Court
         Rolls</title>, pp 68, 34-5, 179. Lock defines ploughale as 'boonwork at ploughtime when ale
        and food were provided by the lord' (p 213).</note></p>

      <p>Fourteen other villages and towns have left small, but significant, evidences of their
       local dramatic, customary, and musical traditions. They include Bardwell, Cratfield, Creeting
       St Mary, Dennington, Hadleigh, Huntingfield, Long Melford, Metfield, Mildenhall, Newmarket,

     <p>Three magnates dominated the redistribution of landholding in Norman Suffolk—William Malet,
      Roger Bigod and Richard FitzGilbert (along with some seventy lesser Norman lords) chosen by
      William I to ensure the subjection of a key strategic county with strong Anglo-Scandinavian
      sympathies. Roger Bigod or Bigot (d. 1107) controlled the towns of Bungay and, Ipswich, the
      strategic settlements of Framlingham and Walton, together with 117 other lordships. His second
      son, Hugh, became the first earl of Norfolk (first creation), a line which ended in 1306.
      Richard de Clare (FitzGilbert, chief justice and trusted advisor and relative of William the
      Conqueror) held the Honour of Clare and ninety-five lordships in Suffolk. The house would end
      in 1314 with the death in battle of the childless Gilbert de Clare. William Malet (d. 1071), a
      companion of William the Conqueror who fought at the Battle of Hastings, held the Honour of
      Eye (the largest lordship in East Anglia) and the extraordinary number of 221 lordships in
      Suffolk. A successor, William Malet (d. 1121), would forfeit his English lands two generations
      later and be banished between 1106 and 1113, re-establishing himself in Normandy. Together,
      the forces of these three magnates would defeat the final invasion of a Scandinavian force
      near Ipswich in 1069.<note type="foot">Dymond and Northeast, <title>History of
       Suffolk</title>, pp 35–6.</note></p>

     <p>During the post-Norman Middle Ages, the period when Suffolk's earliest dramatic records
      begin, four great magnates exercised near absolute control of the county (except for several
      peculiars belonging mainly to the Crown or the Church): the successive abbots of Bury St
      Edmunds; the <rs ref="eats:451406" type="Collective_Titles">earls</rs> (later <rs
       ref="eats:163187" type="Collective_Titles">dukes</rs>) of Norfolk; the <rs ref="eats:356197"
       type="Collective_Titles">earls</rs> (later <rs ref="eats:139211" type="Collective_Titles"
       >dukes</rs>) of Suffolk; and the earls of Clare. Their power derived from their vast land
      holdings, their judicial powers, their lineage, and the royal favour they enjoyed. The abbot
      of Bury St Edmunds, by far the most powerful of the four medieval magnates, held the Liberty
      of Bury St Edmunds, which encompassed all the hundreds in the western half of Suffolk, making
      the abbot the king’s judicial representative and the dominant landholder in half the county.
      His large household, including numerous sub-households managed by his officers, was comparable
      to any aristocrat, employing many servants and largely supplied by, the abbot's manors in the
      vicinity of Bury itself. The abbey’s shrine of St Edmund made the abbey a major place of
      pilgrimage for kings and simple people alike.<note type="foot">Bailey, <title>Medieval
        Suffolk</title>, pp 16–18.</note></p>

     <p>The earl of Norfolk, as Mark Bailey puts it, held 'the most important lay estate' in the
      county, with manors (including Bungay and Framlingham) strategically placed along the rivers
      of east Suffolk. Before the Conquest, two English-born Bretons had held the title, earl of
      Norfolk, but the first major dynasty to hold the lordship was five descendants of Roger Bigod,
      ending with the fifth earl, Roger Bigod who died childless in 1306 and had disinherited his
      brother, thus ending the creation. The second creation began with its first duke, <rs
       ref="eats:314966" type="Person_Male">Thomas de Mowbray</rs>, and ended with the death of the
      fourth duke, <rs ref="eats:382720" type="Person_Male">John de Mowbray</rs>, in 1476. The third
      creation began with, <rs ref="eats:163205" type="Person_Male">John Howard</rs>, who as son of
      Sir Robert Howard and Margaret, daughter of Thomas Mowbray, of Stoke by Nayland inherited the
      Mowbray lands and titles. This creation continues under the Howards to this day. Both the
      Mowbray and Howard creations have yielded dramatic records for this collection, as have
      records related to the earls (later dukes) of Suffolk, who held manors in east and north-east
      Suffolk. The earls of Suffolk (first creation) were members of the de la Pole family, from <rs
       ref="eats:456274" type="Person_Male">William de la Pole</rs> (d. 1450), fourth earl and first
      duke of Suffolk through Edmund de la Pole (d. 1513), the third duke, who was beheaded by Henry
      VIII in 1513. The first duke of the second creation was <rs ref="eats:139229"
       type="Person_Male">Charles Brandon</rs> (d. 1545). The title became extinct with the death of
      Brandon's younger son, Charles in 1551. The third creation had but one duke, Henry Grey,
      father of Lady Jane Grey, executed in 1554 during the reign of Mary.<note type="foot">Bailey,

     <p>The earl of Clare held seven Suffolk manors at Domesday, including three large manors at or
      near the borough of Clare itself. A Norman family that took its name from that place held the
      vast Honour of Clare, spread across England and Wales. Otherwise, the landholdings of the
      great English aristocratic families in the county were limited. The earl of Oxford of Castle
      Hedingham, Essex, held three Suffolk manors, including Lavenham; the prior and convent of Ely
      held four manors and a handful of privatized hundreds as the Liberty of St Ethelreda in East
      Suffolk; and the bishopric of Ely held eight Suffolk manors. Several women were comparable
      aristocratic landlords in Suffolk, among them Elizabeth de Burgh who inherited the Clare
      estate, Alice de Bryne of Acton, and Katherine de Norwich, of Mettingham and Norwich.<note
       type="foot">Bailey, <title>Medieval Suffolk</title>, pp 16–18.</note> Performance records
      survive for four of these great landlords (the abbots of Bury, the Howards, Charles Brandon,
      and Alice de Bryne).</p>

     <p>The medieval aristocracy in Suffolk stood atop a society largely controlled by lesser lay
      landlords that, as superbly analyzed by Mark Bailey, was sophisticated and complex in ways
      unique to East Anglia in general and Suffolk in particular. The description that follows draws
      substantially on Bailey's work.<note type="foot">See especially <title>Medieval
        Suffolk</title>, pp 10–35.</note> All of Suffolk's landlords—whether aristocrats, gentry,
      minor lay landlords, rectors and landlords of smaller monasteries, or prominent local
      freemen—shared common goals: to own land as the principal source of status; to accrue wealth
      by exploiting that land either directly or by leasing to a third party; and to rise in rank by
      marriage or some other means, within the hierarchical strictures of the times. Yet for all our
      focus on the aristocrats holding land within the county, whether lay (dukes, marquesses,
      earls, viscounts, and barons) or ecclesiastical, (bishops, abbeys and priories), the
      archetypal lord in Suffolk was a low status gentry lords of modest means holding at most two
      or three small manors, most of whom came to be known as gentlemen in later centuries, plus
      rectors and smaller monastic landlords. On the lowest rung were prominent local freemen, with
      perhaps a hundred acres of land aspiring to the status of lesser gentry. The Suffolk landscape
      is littered with timber-framed hall houses, and the remains of small moats, which lesser
      landlords built not for defense but to assert their higher social status from the peasantry
      around them in stylish imitation of the greater households.</p>

     <p>The modest social status of local lordship, and the small size of manors, is unusual by
      national standards, and may offer insights into the development of local drama in Suffolk
      because of the insights it affords into Suffolk local culture. As Bailey points out, much of
      England had a 'strong manorial structure' (that is, a strong single lordship, high proportion
      of villein tenants, and coterminality with a village or parish bearing the manor's name).
      Suffolk, however, had a 'weak manorial structure' (that is, many small manors dominated by
      free tenures, landlords of lower rank, communities divided among many minor lordships, strong
      'social and economic individualism,' and, because of all that, 'higher levels of economic 
      development'). Though nominally seignorial, many Suffolk communities derived their unity and
      communal structures not from a lord but from their parochial identity, their confraternities,
      their inter-community bonds; and their shared commercial interests and trading systems.<note
       type="foot">Bailey, <title>Medieval Suffolk</title>, p 27; Birch, <title>Ancient
        Sites</title>, pp 392–3.</note> However, save for their chance appearances in parish and
      civic records, land transactions and the occasional will, most of these minor lay landlords
      are unknowable in any detail before the Reformation.</p>

     <p>The Reformation brought the greatest sudden elevation of families since the Norman Conquest,
      and the extinction of the holdings of Suffolk's wealthiest land-holding magnate, the abbot of
      Bury St Edmunds. As Blackwood succinctly describes it, Henry VIII granted or sold 146 manors,
      formerly held by the church, to sixty-two people, a group that included: Anne of Cleves
      (Henry’s fourth wife); five members of the nobility (the dukes of Suffolk and Norfolk, the
      earls of Essex and Oxford, and Lord Darcy of Chiche); two diocesan entities (deans and
      chapters of Ely and Norwich); two Suffolk lawyers (Sir Humphrey Wingfield and Henry Payne);
      five merchants (William Rede, Sir Thomas Gresham, Adam Winthrop, Paul Withipoll, and most
      notably <rs ref="eats:424824" type="Person_Male">Thomas Kitson</rs>); eight royal officials
      (including Sir Nicholas Bacon, far and away the most significant of the eight); three
      officials who worked for the dukes of Suffolk and Norfolk; and thirty-one additional members
      of the gentry, mainly from Suffolk (most notably Thomas Bacon, Sir <rs ref="eats:430481"
       type="Person_Male">William Drury</rs>).<note type="foot">Blackwood, <title>Tudor and Stuart
        Suffolk</title>, pp 83–9.</note> With the Reformation, for the first time in history Suffolk
      families would be distinguished from each other on the basis of theological difference. See
      headnotes to records of individual families for discussion of both their biographies and their
      residences.</p>

     <p>Records (both documentary and literary), together with the numerous play texts that survive,
      show that medieval and early modern Suffolk had an extraordinarily rich fabric of playing
      traditions. Many of those traditions flourished concurrently within the county’s complex
      social, religious, and political environment.</p>

     <p>This collection contains a wealth of evidence from a great variety of sources, but readers
      experienced with REED editions will notice that it lacks two classes of documents typically
      found there. Because Suffolk was part of the diocese of Norwich, under the authority of the
       <rs ref="eats:429410" type="Collective_Clergy">bishop of Norwich</rs>, most of the voluminous
      court records generated by the diocese, in which those of Norfolk and Suffolk are
      intermingled, are kept at the Norfolk Record Office in Norwich. For that reason, work on the
      Suffolk ecclesiastical court records is being deferred until concentrated work on the Norfolk
      records commences following completion of the Suffolk collection. In due course, Suffolk
      records emerging from the work on Norfolk will be integrated into the Suffolk edition, an easy
      task with a digital publication.</p>

     <p>The evolution of the Suffolk quarter sessions courts too involves complexities which account
      for their untypically thin contribution of material for a REED edition. Suffolk quarter
      sessions were organized into four divisions, which each met once a year in <rs
       ref="eats:373096" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Beccles</rs>, <rs ref="eats:313077"
       type="Place_PA_Settlement">Bury St Edmunds</rs>, <rs ref="eats:369522"
       type="Place_PA_Settlement">Ipswich</rs> and Woodbridge. Today, most early records of their
      sessions are housed at Suffolk Archives in Ipswich. As was a typical impulse in Suffolk,
      municipal corporations ‘sought to obtain their own Sessions of the Peace to exclude the county
      authorities.' Borough courts took on much of the traditional business of sessions themselves.
      Further, the evolving courts often found themselves handling both criminal and administrative
      matters, reducing detail in entries of potential interest.<note type="foot">David Allen,

     <p>The earliest surviving written references to drama in early Suffolk occur in book lists and
      catalogues to the library at the <rs ref="eats:368503" type="Place_F_ReligiousHouse">abbey of
       Bury St Edmunds</rs>. In the eleventh century the library had two copies of Prudentius’
       <title>Psychomachia</title>. By the second quarter of the twelfth century Abbot Anselm had
      brought an emphasis on the Feast of the Immaculate Conception and ‘the stories of the Virgin’s
      miracles.’ By the mid-twelfth century the abbey library had a volume containing the complete
      works of Plautus and Terence. And by the mid- to late-thirteenth century, the library had a
      copy of Seneca’s <title>Tragedies</title>. The presence of these books provides no evidence
      that any of these plays was performed at the Abbey during that period, but it does confirm a
      local awareness of matters theatrical from a very early time.<note type="foot">R.M. Thomson,

     <p>The records of actual events having performative content in Suffolk begin with tournaments.
      The earliest tournaments in Suffolk, those in the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries,
      were, as typically of the period, warlike <hi rend="italic">melees</hi>—very destructive in
      that they ‘ranged over such a wide area of countryside,’ and, therefore, do not appear to have
      been mimetic in the sense used in this book. The earliest such tournament in Suffolk occurred
      at a site between Bury and Thetford in 1194. Its aftermath, but not the <hi rend="italic"
       >melee</hi> itself, included a rowdy bout of singing and dancing by the knights at Bury.<note
       type="foot">Juliet V. Barker, <title>The Tournament in England 1100–1400</title> (Woodbridge,
       1986), 10, 51, 12.</note> By the fourteenth century, tournaments—now called ‘hastiludi’—had
      evolved from pure <hi rend="italic">melees</hi> into forms of entertainment with metaphorical
      elements of mock warfare. In Richard Barber’s words, the ‘hastiludi’ had become ‘knightly
      prowess as visual entertainment, even theatre.’ ‘Hastiludi’ characteristically included
      mimetic processions, feasting, elaborate <rs ref="eats:42274" type="Thing_TheatricalCostume"
       >costumes</rs> and masks, scenery, <rs ref="eats:41777" type="Thing_MusicalInstrument"
       >trumpets</rs> and other musical instruments, though Suffolk documents do not confirm those
      elements in Suffolk ‘hastiludi.’ Notably, great numbers of costumed women of rank took part,
      as attested by royal accounts from the period. Expenses of Edward the Black Prince related to
      a tournament at Bury St Edmunds in 1348 certainly contained rewards to <rs ref="eats:8709"
       type="Entertainer_Type">minstrels</rs>, and lavish spending on garments for noble women who
      took part in the event, but say nothing more descriptive about the proceedings.<note

     <head>Local Drama and Civic Ceremony</head>
     <p>The jewel of performance in early Suffolk is its multifarious traditions of locally produced
      religious and civic drama and mimetic customs. Together, they present a picture of a complex
      culture steeped in performance. But scribal usage, particularly laconic references to ‘game,’
      'play,’ ‘interlude,’ and ‘ale’ in the records sometimes make it difficult to know exactly to
      what kind of performance a scribe is referring. In some instances the records make perfectly
      clear that game meant <rs ref="eats:40453" type="Drama_Type">play</rs>, as is the case with
      Bungay’s two parishes. In Holy Trinity parish, for example, the ‘game’ in parish records
      referred to the play (that is, the <rs ref="eats:40398" type="Drama_Type">interlude</rs>)
      staged within the context of an elaborate <rs ref="eats:40561" type="Entertainment_Type"
       >church ale</rs>. The Holy Trinity game had an ‘Interlude &amp; game Booke’ (see <ref
       target="https://ereed.org/search/?facet_locations_settlement_b=372934&amp;start=0&amp;facet_record_type_church=Parish"
       >the Bungay records</ref>), from which the wardens paid for writing out parts in 1557–8. The
      Holy Trinity game also had costumes. In <ref
       target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid136/">1565–6</ref> wardens borrowed apparel
      for playing from the <rs ref="eats:366637" type="Person_Male">earl of Surrey</rs> in Norwich.
      His house, to which they would have returned the apparel, was the duke of Norfolk’s palace,
      situated on the south side of the River Wensum not far from the Market Place. They paid
      elsewhere for the staining of certain clothing for the interlude. Following the game in <ref
       target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid138/">1567–8</ref> they returned apparel to
       <rs ref="eats:373324" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Wymondham</rs>, Norfolk (a town that had a
      game place, and an inventory that included 'a list of "apparel for the game players"'; thus in
      Wymondham too, game meant play).<note type="foot">John Wasson and Peter Galloway (eds),
        <title>Records of Plays and Players in Norfolk and Suffolk 1330–1642</title>, Malone Society
       11 (Oxford, 1980/1), 120.</note> In <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid140/"
       >1576–7</ref> Holy Trinity sold ‘the game players gownes &amp; coat{es}’ from old copes;
      elsewhere the same account refers to 'the game players app{ar}ell.' In <ref
       target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid141/">1590–1</ref> the parish sold players’
      coats, apparently no longer used in community drama. The Holy Trinity game also used props. In
       <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid133/">1557–8</ref>, a parishioner rode to
      Yarmouth for game gear and in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid138/"
       >1567–8</ref> the wardens purchased nine planks for the cloud. Holy Trinity also used a
      scaffold stage for its game. In <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid136/"
       >1565–6</ref> the wardens paid for a scaffold 'for the Interlude in the churchyarde' and took
      a collection 'at the churche ale &amp; game on Trinyte sondaie.' In <ref
       target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid137/">1566–7</ref> they twice purchased nails
      for the scaffold and also paid for making and watching the scaffold. In <ref
       target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid138/">1567–8</ref> they paid for disassembling
      the scaffold.</p>

     <p>The interchangeable use of game, interlude, and play, as part of a church ale by Holy
      Trinity, Bungay, confirms that the three terms were one and the same to the scribe and the
      wardens for whom he was writing. A payment 'to Kelsaye the vyce for his pastyme before the
      plaie and after the playe both daies' and another payment for the dying of wigsfor the
      interlude players (both payments in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid136/"
       >1565–6</ref>) strongly suggest that the play or game was a two-day production and was very
      likely a <rs ref="eats:129826" type="Drama_Type">morality play</rs>. In the records that we
      have, it was always produced within the context of a church ale and the parish provided a
      dinner for the players.<note type="foot">Lowestoft: Suffolk Record Office 116/E1/1, p 18;
       Lowestoft: Suffolk Record Office 115/E1/1, pp 34–5.</note></p>

     <p>St Mary, Bungay, the town’s other parish, also had a game, which they mounted on Corpus
      Christi Day in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid143/">1542–3</ref>. The
      game must have been a scaffold play because the producers copied out parts from the game book
      in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid142/">1525–6</ref>, purchased nails for
      the stage in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid144/">1545–6</ref> and <ref
       target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid146/">1573</ref>, and paid to strengthen the
      stage in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid145/">1546–7</ref>. Characters
      appear to have worn costumes in that the churchwardens paid for the sewing of six <rs
       ref="eats:302317" type="Thing_TheatricalCostume">albs</rs>. In 1545–6 St Mary parish appears
      to have staged its play in the <rs ref="eats:373153" type="Place_F_Church">churchyard</rs>. St
      Mary also mounted a <rs ref="eats:40619" type="Entertainment_Type">procession</rs> on the
      Friday following Corpus Christi Day. A case recorded in the court of Star Chamber indicates
      that the procession had at least five <rs ref="eats:403978" type="Entertainment_Type"
       >pageants</rs> (Heaven, the World, Paradise, Bethlehem, and Hell) that were ‘Caryed abowt the
      seyd Town’ on that day. The records establish no links between the play and the procession
      except to confirm that the Corpus Christi celebration in Bungay was a two-day event.</p>

     <p><rs ref="eats:386439" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Walsham le Willows</rs> provides a further
      example of the certain interchangeability of the terms ‘game’ and ‘play.’ Late fifteenth and
      sixteenth century Walsham had an outdoor playing space which they called the <rs
       ref="eats:386537" type="Place_F_OpenArea">game place</rs>, and described it as ‘made of
      purpose for the use of stage playes.’</p>

     <p>A much larger number of records contain references to games or plays, but never to both in
      the same record, and almost never with sufficient detail to determine the precise nature of
      the event being recorded.</p>

     <p>We know that three of these communities had a game only because they travelled to advertise
      it, as recorded by the place they visited to announce their production. Thetford Priory,
      bordering Suffolk in Norfolk, paid 'Walsham game et Gyslyngham' 16d in
      1505–6<!--IN: I can't find a record related to this. I expect it may have been removed from the collection?-->.
      Both parishes lie but a few miles from Thetford. The entry appears to indicate that the two
      Suffolk communities were advertising their co-sponsored game. Walsham records, as mentioned
      above, confirm that the parish used its game place for stage plays (see below), so one might
      assume that game in the Thetford entry means play. In the same year (1505–6) Thetford Priory
      also paid <rs ref="eats:367559" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Bardwell</rs>, Suffolk, for
      announcing its game.<note type="foot">Register of Thetford Priory, Part 1, Cambridge, CUL:
       Add. MSS 6969, f 72.</note></p>

     <p>The remaining references to games occur as opaque entries in parish records. Bramfield
      received 4d when it ‘schewed’ its game at Walberswick in 1493–4
      <!--IN: I can't find a record related to this. I expect it may have been removed from the collection?-->.
      The town of <rs ref="eats:385027" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Metfield</rs> (approximately 5
      miles from Bungay) collected the extremely large amount of 11 marks 4s for its game in <ref
       target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid181/">1510–11</ref>, and an indeterminate
      amount in 1513–14, the only two references to its game that survive. Metfield also contributed
      to Bungay’s game in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid182/">1510</ref>. <rs
       ref="eats:368526" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Long Melford</rs> (near Bury) kept a game in
      1555–6 and again in 1556–7
      <!--IN: I can't find a record related to this. I expect it may have been removed from the collection?-->.
      Long Melford proclaimed its game as far away as Braintree, Essex, and Ipswich, an effort that
      they likely would not have exerted if the game was anything but a play. Further indicating
      that the Long Melford game at Whitsuntide was likely a play, the parish set up thirteen seats
      in the churchyard for some who attended. In 1538 the fragmentary accounts of the parish of
      Mickfield, a tiny parish three miles west of Debenham in the centre of the county recorded
      receipts from its game (without providing details as to what the game entailed). In spite of
      the miniscule size of the parish, the records give no indication that it was aided in
      producing its game by other parishes.</p>

     <p>The one reference to a play, as opposed to a game, occurs when Thetford Priory paid <rs
       ref="eats:311842" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Mildenhall</rs> (a few miles from Thetford) 12d
      for announcing its play in 1505–6.<note type="foot">Cambridge University Library, Add MS 6969,
       f 70.</note> In <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid171/">1504–5</ref>
      Mildenhall had staged a <rs ref="eats:431506" type="Drama_TitledWork">play of St Thomas</rs>
      in its hall yard, at which they collected &#x00A3;7 in contributions for the parish. One might
      reasonably assume that the Mildenhall play being advertised the following year at Thetford was
      the same parish play of St Thomas. In <ref
       target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid173/">1509–10</ref> Mildenhall paid players
      13d at its May ale and in 1528 many parishioners gave contributions toward what they
      identified as a play called a May game. In 1540 parishioners contributed 21s for what they
      described as a play or church ale. Based on these records, Mildenhall appears to have used
      game, play, and church ale interchangeably.</p>

     <p>In the records cited above, the word 'game' never demonstrably refers to something less than
      a play, and it often co-exists synonymously with the words ‘play,’ ‘interlude,’ and ‘show,'
      but in other cases it may well have meant some mimetic custom other than a play or interlude.
      The term also several times occurs in connection with a church ale. Games appear only
      intermittently in the records of any place, and when that happens, they appear to be major
      fund-raising events that drew crowds and contributors from places far outside the host
      community.</p>

     <p>The records provide evidence that at least thirty-six Suffolk communities had productions of
      their own. Additionally, the Suffolk records identify three communities from Essex, one from
      Cambridgeshire, and two from Norfolk that also had plays, and either received support from, or
      extended support to, Suffolk communities in the production of their plays. In some cases, the
      evidence for these plays appears in churchwardens' accounts as payments or collections
      concerning their play's production. The evidence might be as spare as a single payment for
      nails or boards to repair the stage (as at <rs ref="eats:366764" type="Place_PA_Settlement"
       >Aldeburgh</rs> or Walberswick
      <!--IN: I can't find any records related to Walberswick. I expect they may have been removed from the collection?-->);
      or as page after page of contributions made, or offerings given in support of the play; as
      expenses of other kinds for an elaborate production and church ale (as at Bungay); or as
      contributions by a host of other parishes supporting a single parish that was mounting its
      play (as at Boxford). In numerous other places, the evidence might be a solitary gift to
      players who had come to advertise their play, as in the register of Thetford Priory and at
      Bardwell, Walsham, and Gislingham.<note type="foot">Cambridge University Library, Add MS 6969,
       f 72.</note></p>

     <p>In the distribution of those places that had plays, one can see five clusters of
      communities. The largest cluster, with fourteen communities in northeast Suffolk, encompassed
      northern areas and towns along or near the Waveney River between Thetford and the coast. One
      could reasonably extend that group to include nearby Yarmouth and Wymondham, in Norfolk,
      especially since both made contributions of various kinds to plays in several of those Suffolk
      towns and also had plays of their own. Moving south lay a second cluster, with four places, in
      north-central Suffolk, an area associated with the Rickenhall fragment (see below) and the
      Walsham-le-Willows game place. A third small cluster including Bury St Edmunds and Long
      Melford lay in west-central Suffolk, as did a fourth small cluster in central Suffolk. Finally
      a fifth cluster involving seven communities lay in south Suffolk, in an area near the border
      with Essex. This cluster is the second largest one in the county. Additionally, three Essex
      communities near the border with Suffolk whose plays are mentioned in Suffolk records, could
      be added to this fifth cluster. Viewing these clusters in horizontal terms, one can see three
      horizontal strata in the communities with recorded plays (a northern stratum with nineteen
      places; a central stratum with four places; and a southern stratum with nine places). Every
      region of the county had parish plays, but they are most abundant in the northern parts of the
      county. Finally, one can see clusters or micro-clusters of communities that lie within a given
      hundred (notably in places on or near the border with Norfolk). It is unclear whether that
      distribution suggests possible links between the plays and the very ancient adminstrative
      institutions (such as the hundreds) that were ‘the basis of all public administration in
      medieval England, judicial, fiscal, and military,’ second only to the county courts until
      ‘superceded by the establishment of Quarter Sessions in the later Middle Ages.’<note

     <p>Rickinghall, a village situated near a tributary of the River Waveney in northwest Suffolk,
      has a place in this edition because of one very significant document—the famous Rickinghall
      Fragment, a one-piece fragment of a medieval play. The words from the play survive on a small
      piece of parchment attached to <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid7/">an
       account roll from the manor of the abbey of Bury St Edmunds dated 1369–70</ref>. The medieval
      landlord of Rickinghall Inferior (one half of a bifurcated village) was the abbot of Bury St
       Edmunds.<note type="foot">Mel Birch, <title>Ancient Sites</title>, pp 319–21; Goult,
        <title>West Suffolk</title>, np; and Bailey, <title>Medieval Suffolk</title>, p 49, 55, 61,
       and 111.</note> The play fragment itself appears to date from the early fourteenth century.
      It is written in Norman French and English, with a stage direction in Latin. The collection
      containing the fragment came to the British Library from <rs ref="eats:371403"
       type="Place_F_Residence">Redgrave Hall</rs>. Since the Hall is only about two miles from
      Rickinghall, the fragment appears never to have migrated very far from its original home.
      Whether the play was staged at Rickinghall or Redgrave Hall, or somewhere else is unclear.
      Rickinghall is one of five parishes bordering the immense Allwood Green.<note type="foot">One
       of the five bordering parishes (Walsham–le–Willows) had an outdoor playing space; two of them

       border with Suffolk.</note></p>

     <head>Corpus Christi Drama and Its Aftermath</head>
     <p>Records of Corpus Christi drama and <rs ref="eats:403978" type="Entertainment_Type">related
       Corpus Christi activities</rs> survive for five Suffolk communities: Bungay, Bury, Eye,
      Ipswich, and Mildenhall, ranging from 1389 to 1547.</p>

     <p>Bury St Edmunds has the earliest recorded Corpus Christi tradition in the county, one that
      comes down to us in three documents only. A <ref
       target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid95/">certificate of 1389</ref> for the guild
      of Corpus Christi, listing the duties of the brothers and sisters of the guild on Corpus
      Christi Day, includes the holding of a mass, the wearing of hooded livery, and the providing
      of 'maintenance' and 'support' for a Corpus Christi interlude. The certificate does not
      mention a procession or pageants; however, the words 'maintenance' and 'support' suggest at
      least the possibility of a permanent store of play-making properties of some kind. In 1477 the
       <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid82/">Regulations of the Guild of Woolen
       Weavers</ref> refers to a procession of pageants and a pageant of the Ascension of God in
      1477. In 1558 a <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid93/">civic rental and
       inventory</ref> refers to ‘certain pageants’ that remain from the <rs ref="eats:458733"
       type="Collective_GuildsReligious">Corpus Christi guild</rs>. Based on these few documents
      (transcribed in the records), in Bury (as in Ipswich) the Corpus Christi play and the
      procession appear to have been separate and distinct events, although the Ascension pageant
      (as described in the record) sounds as if it had dramatic elements. However, it is hard to
      know whether the dramatic elements in pageants such as this one were dumb shows or enactments
      within the procession.<note type="foot">Gail McMurray Gibson has proposed that <title>The
        Croxton Play of the Sacrament</title> was written for, and performed on, the feast of Corpus
       Christi in Bury St Edmunds (<title>The Theatre of Devotion: East Anglian Drama and Society in
        the Late Middle Ages</title> (Chicago, 1989), 34–8, 40). She cites local allusions in the
       manuscript; a town configuration that meets the staging requirements of the play (‘the open
       market square at Angel Hill, just in front of the parish church of St James,’ p 40), and the
       initials ‘R.C.’ written on the manuscript that she suggests refer to the Haughley vicar
       Robert Cooke, whose will bequeaths all his playbooks to his brother. She sees the play as a
       ‘careful, polemical answer to Lollard heresy ... affirming the miracle of the Real Presence’
       a theme especially appropriate to Corpus Christi (p 35). Her close analysis of the text
       further serves to support her thesis (pp 36–7). She also proposes that the play was produced
       by the town’s Corpus Christi Guild, with allusions in it to the local Guild of The Holy Name
       of Jesus as well (pp 38-40). She freely acknowledges that, in the absence of documentary
       confirmation, ‘there is no way to know with certainty’ where the play originated (p
       35).</note></p>

     <p>The few records that survive concerning Corpus Christi activities in Bungay provide
      particularly suggestive detail. In <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid73/"
       >1514</ref> five men of Bungay brought a case to the court of Star Chamber charging that the
      bailiff of the town, the duke of Norfolk’s officer, <rs ref="eats:403214" type="Person_Male"
       >Richard Wharton</rs>, together with other rioters had broken and thrown down five Corpus
      Christi pageants (namely, the pageants of Heaven, of the World, of Paradise, of Bethlehem, and
      of Hell), 'whyche were euer wont tofore to be Caryed abowt the seyd Town vpon the seyd daye'
      [of Corpus Christi].' In his answer, Wharton acknowledged the deed; claimed that the pageants
      were 'very old &amp; auncyent' and a source of great expense; that he had made peace with the
      victims; and that he would assist in building new pageants. The description of the pageants
      suggests the possibility of a cycle of sorts. Wharton's defense suggests that pageantry and
      the celebration of Corpus Christi itself were not under attack; rather it was the dilapidated
      state of the pageants that had given rise to the trouble.</p>
     <p>The town of <rs ref="eats:373992" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Eye</rs> (in north-central
      Suffolk) recorded a play on Corpus Christi Day in <ref
       target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid213/">1536</ref>. In <ref
       target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid176/">1540–1</ref> the churchwardens’ accounts
      of the town of Mildenhall had two successive entries—one records a receipt of money from a
      gathering on Corpus Christi Day; the other records a receipt of money from a gathering for the
      play (also called a church ale). Proximity of the two entries aside, without further details
      it is impossible to determine whether the play and ale occurred on Corpus Christi Day.</p>

     <p>By far the most details of a Corpus Christi tradition appear in the Ipswich court books and
      civic accounts. In that important port town, responsibility for civic celebration of Corpus
      Christi lay with the ancient <rs ref="eats:402310" type="Collective_GuildsReligious">guild of
       Corpus Christi</rs>, which was also the city's principal governing body.</p>

     <p>The Corpus Christi guild (originally called the Ipswich merchant guild) operated at the
      direction of the Great Court of all the freemen (also called the General Court). Among its
      manifold duties, the Great Court also supervised the annual election of the officers of the
      Corpus Christi guild, including the <rs ref="eats:403996" type="Collective_Office"
       >wardens</rs> of specific pageants, and appointed certain freemen of the city to guard the
      pageants. The wardens of the Corpus Christi guild bore entire responsibility for the city's
      festive and ceremonial celebration of the feast of Corpus Christi and all matters related to
      it. The records indicate that with the common clerk, and under the supervision of the
      bailiffs, the wardens periodically appointed (and the Great Court so ordered) a craftsman with
      special skills to attend, administer, and guard every one of the accoutrements of the
      pageants; to do repair of the pageants; to oversee the making of stages for the players from
      within the town and without; and to supervise the hiring of costumes. In 1445, for example,
      the court admitted <rs ref="eats:402249" type="Person_Male">John Causton</rs> as a resident
       <rs ref="eats:297065" type="Collective_Office">burgess</rs> and hired him to be that overseer
      for the seven years to follow. No doubt his four sons also benefited from that
      arrangement.</p>

     <p>The Corpus Christi guild used several sources of revenue to finance its Corpus Christi
      activities. First, in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid250/">1443</ref> and
       <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid251/">1445</ref>, the Great Court granted
      it the profits from two pieces of land: 'the Marsh' with its houses, buildings, arable lands,
      meadows, grazing pastures, marshes, and appurtenances; and 'the Councillors' meadow. The Court
      also ordered that farmers of the properties should pay 40s annually to the guild, all the
      resulting monies from the properties to be used for the maintenance and repair of the
      pageants. Second, in 1446, the alderman of the Corpus Christi guild received a monopoly to
      sell or trade any large stone (mill, quarry, grinding, paving, and any others unnamed) within
      the city. Third, all burgesses, resident and non-resident alike, were annually assessed 16d
      toward the work of Corpus Christi. In 1482 the Court reminded everyone that any burgess not
      paying his assessment stood in pain of forfeiting his status as a burgess.
      Fourth, in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid332/">1503</ref> the Court
      appointed two of the freemen to collect the usual 50s for the pageant on Corpus Christi Day
      (the wording makes it unclear as to whether it was that pageant or the collecting that
      occurred on Corpus Christi Day), and pass it along to the person in charge. Officials also
      appointed a number of other people with specific responsibilities (see for example, SRO Ipswich: C/2/10/3/5, pp 434 and 548; C/2/10/3/8, p 102; BL: Add MS 24435, ff 33 and 153-3v; and numerous others).</p>
     
     <p>The guild had three principal duties related to the celebration of Corpus Christi: to host
      the Corpus Christi feast; to produce the <rs ref="eats:405485" type="Drama_TitledWork">Corpus
       Christi play</rs>; and to organize the Corpus Christi procession and pageants. The first
      mention of the dinner occurs in 1469. In 1515 the assembly book mentions a great store of
      utensils, dinnerware, and related supplies, all to be carefully
      guarded<!-- IN: I can't find a relevant record here, unless it is https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid264/?-->.
      References to the dinner disappear from the records between 1515 and 1589, though references
      to the annual meeting and elections regularly appear. Responsibility for the dinner, and
      disputes about payment for burgesses and their wives recur in the records, which may account
      for the dinners' disappearance. After 1589, the dinners reappear periodically through the
      mid-seventeenth century, though often by seemingly reluctant wardens under duress to do
      so.</p>

     <p>While crafts contributed mightily to the Corpus Christi procession with their pageants,
      ultimate authority over the procession, and everything in it, lay with the Corpus Christi
      guild. The guild’s constitution for the Corpus Christi procession provides the sequence of
      occupations and pageants to be followed in the procession. Participants in 1325 included
      fourteen companies, three groups of friars (the <rs ref="eats:443248"
       type="Collective_GuildsReligious">Carmelites</rs>, <rs ref="eats:443281"
       type="Collective_GuildsReligious">Dominicans</rs>, and <rs ref="eats:443314"
       type="Collective_GuildsReligious">Franciscans</rs>), clerics, and civic officials. The
      companies represented forty-nine guilds, who presented nine pageants and a tabernacle. The
      pageants included those of five saints (George, John, Giles, Thomas, and Luke), the Blessed
      Virgin Mary, a dolphin, a bull, and a ship. Some time after the original of this constitution
      was copied in 1530, someone crossed out, in red ink, all the pageants except the dolphin and
      the ship, clearly a sixteenth-century effort to expunge Catholic elements.<note type="foot"

     <p>In <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid318/">1400</ref> 'The Pageant' (as
      the procession is called in the record), included thirteen (not fourteen) companies and
      forty-eight (not forty-nine) guilds, plus the three groups of friars. The companies presented
      eight (not nine) pageants that included images, shrines related to patron saints,
      contrivances, a bull, and a ship. The Friars had a tabernacle. In <ref
       target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid319/">1437</ref> the Customal called ‘The
      Little Domesday Book’ provides a smaller list that includes a mere fifteen of what it calls
      'Pageants' comprising twelve guilds, three saints (George, Giles, and Thomas), a tabernacle,
      the usual three orders of friars, but also the Prioress of Trinity and Saint Peter, the
      bailiff, and the portman.</p>

     <p>In <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid337/">1493–6</ref> the list includes
      thirteen companies and forty-three guilds, but only four named pageants, all of them pageants
      of saints (George, Giles, John, and Thomas). The procession includes gentlemen, but makes no
      mention of clerics, a tabernacle, the friars, or town officers. In 1495 a list of payments for
      Corpus Christi includes four saints and eleven guilds only, but payments by no one else. A
      final list, <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid320/"><hi rend="italic">c</hi>
       1500–8</ref>, the last one before the Reformation, has forty-eight guilds in fourteen
      companies, with eight pageants that include a dolphin, a ship, and six saints (Giles, George,
      John, Luke, Thomas, and the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary).</p>

     <p>It is not possible to know if the pageants of the dolphin, the bull, the Assumption, or the
      various saints also included acting with speeches, but descriptions of the duties assigned to
      Causton and later to <rs ref="eats:410185" type="Person_Male">King</rs> certainly do not seem
      specific to the pageant of the ships only, and in <ref
       target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid325/">1493</ref> Ipswich had elected a
      resident burgess for 'making and correcting the book of Corpus Christi.' At least one of the
      pageants, described in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid338/">1473</ref> as
      'the tabernacle of St Thomas the Martyr' does seem a likely candidate to have been a tableau
      vivant. It also seems likely that the pageants were large structures. An order in <ref
       target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid325/">1493</ref> sets aside money, as the
      Council had done the previous year, 'for the maintenance of the pageant the same sum for the
      craftsmen.’</p>

     <p>It is impossible to sort out the precise relationship between the Corpus Christi procession,
      with its pageants, and the Corpus Christi play, with its stages. The entire celebration is
      suffused with performance. Over the course of time, the terminology used in the records
      shifts. Early on the records rather formally distinguish between the procession and the play.
      But in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid332/">1503</ref> the town's
      recorder refers to the whole procession as 'the pageant,' and sometimes as 'the pastime.' In
       <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid267/">1531</ref> the town laid aside the
      play forever, but in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid269/">1542</ref> an
      order decreed that every householder was to follow the pageants of Corpus Christi.</p>

     <p>The elements of the procession suggest a carefully organized, pious—yet
      spectacle-filled—event, confirmed by the reference in one record to a Corpus Christi Book. The
      procession included tableaux vivants but the description of the ship pageant as having
      speeches from within indicates elements of characterization and dialogue as well, and a
      pageant of considerable size, as did the pageant of the Dolphin. If the pageant of the
      Assumption resembled other Assumption pageants in the East Midlands, it likely included
      machinery and several visual levels.<note type="foot">See Barbara D. Palmer, ‘Staging the
       Virgin’s Body: Spectacular Effects of Annunciation and Assumption,’ <title>The Early Drama,

     <p>The Corpus Christi play appears to have been a separate event from the procession within the
      larger celebration of Corpus Christi: the play was a fixed-site production that used scaffold
      stages, whereas the pageants were processional.</p>

     <p>Clearly, the Corpus Christi celebration in Ipswich had unbroken access to great
      show-producing skill during much of the fifteenth century. In <ref
       target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid582/">1445</ref> the Council hired a man, John
      Causton, who 'will make provision and arrangements concerning the repair of the pageants and for
      the construction of the stages for the actors both from the town and outside.' Causton, the
      common clerk, and the bailiffs were to be responsible for 'incurring all and each of the
      expenses both for the repair of the pageants and for the hiring of the arrayment, clothing,
      and other necessaries which will be necessary for the said pageants.'<note type="foot">Suffolk

     <p>As Philip Butterworth and Michael Spence show, Ipswich had the services of <rs
       ref="eats:402723" type="Person_Male">William Parnell</rs>, a master property player, during
      the second half of the fifteenth century.<note type="foot">Philip Butterworth and Michael

      Woodville into Norwich in 1469 by exploring in great detail the contributions to production of
      the plays and spectacles created for the entry by Parnell, a theatrical producer from Ipswich
      who had ‘undoubted’ theatrical skill, and ‘who regularly supplies ingenious devices for plays
      and stations’ in that town. In Norwich Parnell worked with William Bisshope, and a number of
      men whom Parnell had brought from Ipswich ‘to work with him.’ The authors describe in great
      detail the platform stages and dressings that Parnell and his crew built and ‘some kind of
      three-dimensional structured edifice surrounding the gate under which the Queen entered the
      city.’ He also supplied two giants and costumes for two (or more) patriarchs, three empresses,
      twelve apostles, and sixteen virgins.</p>

     <p>Later (in 1474), the by-then famous Parnell together with his son, John, and William Baker

      pertained to them. Butterworth and Spence describe him as being the second earliest known
      property player in East Anglia (preceded only by John Causton, of Ipswich). By 1505 Parnell’s
      son, John, had followed in his father’s footsteps in Ipswich, as one who worked on the Corpus
      Christi play there. He is also recorded as making the pageants on Corpus Christi Day in
      Dunmow, Essex in 1527/8.<note type="foot">Butterworth and Spence, ‘William Parnell,’ pp 32–3

     <p>In <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid325/">1493</ref> the guild hired one
       <rs ref="eats:402849" type="Person_Male">John Regner</rs> to repair the book of Corpus
      Christi (among other Corpus Christi-related duties). Whether that book was an ordinal for the
      procession or a play text, the records do not say. Other than reference to the stages,
      assembly books offer no other detail concerning the Corpus Christi play in Ipswich. Whether or
      not to produce the play was apparently a problem for the city in the early sixteenth century.
      Although they almost always held the dinner through 1514, officials cancelled both the dinner
      and the play in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid587/">1515</ref>, <ref

       target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid267/">1531</ref> the city ordered that the
      play be laid aside forever, whereas the pageants continued to flourish. The city gives no
      reason for abandoning the play but there was an explosive political environment of protest in
      Suffolk during those years. In Bungay, for example, in <ref
       target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid70/">1537</ref>, the duke of Suffolk spent
      considerable effort pursuing the maker of a play satirizing the king and fomenting
      sedition.</p>

     <p>Following the suppression of the feast of Corpus Christi in 1548, the former Corpus Christi
      guild emerged as the merchant guild. From 1565 through 1634 the guild paid minstrels to
      perform at its annual feast, which they also called ‘the Guild.’ In Elizabethan and Jacobean
      Ipswich drama and ceremony gradually re-emerged as civic drama, processions, feasts and
      ceremonies. In <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid384/">1563–4</ref> the
      council paid the town players on 17 November, but whether the players were celebrating the
      Queen’s coronation, the entry does not say. At least some of the pageants in the town’s huge
      civic procession certainly had dramatic elements. In <ref
       target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid300/">1583</ref> the council reimbursed <rs
       ref="eats:410185" type="Person_Male">John King</rs> who 'lately made [a] shewe of a certen
      pageant in forme of a Shippe with certen convenynt speches therin' for the feast of the
      merchant guild.' (See <ref target="#drama-waits">discussion of King below</ref>.). A
      pageant of the ship had first been mentioned in the city records more than sixty years
      earlier, in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid327/">1521</ref>, so that
      pageant had a life cycle spanning much of the sixteenth century. Between 1588 and 1600 the
      town mounted a celebration of <rs ref="eats:411404" type="CalendarDay_Secular">Coronation
       Day</rs> and on another day in 1588–9, a triumph (to celebrate the defeat of the Spanish
      Armada). Celebrations of Coronation Day (also known as Queen’s Day) were mounted nine times,

     <head>Staging</head>
     <p>The records indicate that <rs ref="eats:302248" type="Thing_SetMachinery">scaffold</rs>
      staging was the dominant method of production for local parish plays in Suffolk. The records
      also include payments for pageants but their number is smaller. Sometimes however, scaffold
      staging and pageants occur in the same performance setting. The evidence for staging, however
      fragmentary and opaque, occurs in the records of eleven communities.</p>

     <p>Ipswich is one of only three towns in Suffolk (the other two being Bungay and Bury St
      Edmunds) whose records mention both pageants and scaffold stages, and do so in both pre- and
      post-suppression incarnations. Ipswich is the only one of the three to record using pageants
      and scaffold stages in connection with a single event—the celebration of the feast of Corpus
      Christi.</p>

     <p>In two instances, the Aldeburgh churchwardens made payments for what may be the building or
      assembling of scaffold stages. In <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid24/"
       >1571–2</ref> they paid 6d 'for nayles to mak the stagis,' and in <ref
       target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid27/">1574–5</ref> 'for carieng of staging
      &amp; Ropes for ye church.'<note type="foot">In <ref
        target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid26/">1573–4</ref>, the Aldeburgh wardens paid
       10s ' To ye earle of Lecesters menne when thei plaied in ye church ye xx<hi
        rend="superscript">ti</hi> of Ivne,’ but whether the players used scaffold staging the
       records do not say. A single reference to staging occurs in the Boxford records, in 1547–8,
       when the wardens paid 6d ' to forbye for helpynge of the Wryghter of the churche to make hys
       stagynge' (Suffolk Archives EE 1/I/2/1).</note> As discussed earlier, the town of Bungay used
      both pageants and scaffold staging, but they appear to have been used on different kinds of
      occasions—the pageants in Corpus Christi processions, the scaffold stages in plays at church
      ales in the churchyard.</p>

     <p>As early as 1477 Bury St Edmunds was using pageants in processions. In that year, <ref
       target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid82/">the regulations of the Woolen
       Weavers</ref> decreed that if a warden of that guild failed to carry out his duties toward
      the guild, half of his fine should ‘go to the sustentacion &amp; mayntenance of the payent
      [pageant] of the Assencion of our lord god and of the yiftys of the holy gost as yt hath be
      customed of olde tyme owte of mynde yeerly to be had to the wurshepe of god amongge other
      payenttes in the procession in the ffeste of Corpus christi.' The tradition had apparently
      died away well before 1558 because in that year pageants were included in an <ref
       target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid93/">inventory of defunct items</ref>. Whether
      it had been revived during the reign of Mary (after being suppressed in 1547), the records do
      not say. By this point local plays were being staged in houses or halls, usually by the
      schoolmaster and his students, and an occasional travelling company. The first and only
      reference to scaffolding occurs very late, in <ref
       target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid80/">1639</ref>, when the schoolmaster, Mr.
      Stevens, was to be reimbursed for ‘... all the charges that shalbe layd out &amp; disbursed
      for the makynge of a stage at the Abby for a Com{m}odye for the entertaynem{en}t of the high
      sheriff of the County of Suffo{lk} that now is: &amp; the seid stage to be kept &amp; the
      serues to the vse of the Schoole...' So by the mid-sixteenth century only the schoolmaster and
      his school boys were apparently using scaffold staging in Bury.</p>

     <p>Hadleigh certainly used scaffold staging during the sixteenth century. In <ref
       target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid223/">1547</ref> the churchwardens paid ' ffor
      makyng ye stage yn the chorche &amp; ffor nayls.' In <ref
       target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid224/">1597</ref> the privy council, having
      heard of the town of Hadleigh's intention ‘...to make ce{r}taine Stage playes at this tyme of
      the Whitson holydaies next ensuinge; and thether to draw a Concourse of people out of the
      Country thereaboute{s} pretending heerein the benefit of the Towne...' issued an order
      prohibiting '...the Officers and all others in the Towne of Hadley not to goe forward w{i}th
      the sayd playes, and to Cause the Stage prepared for them to be plucked downe....'</p>

     <p>Walberswick<!--IN: As far as I know there are no Walberswick records in the collection?-->
      churchwardens’ accounts contain three payments for staging in the second half of the fifteenth
      century. In 1450 the wardens paid 'herdelys for the staging.' In 1496–7 they paid 'Iamys
      symson &amp; Rychard howlet &amp; Iohn sstanton for helpyng to make the stage for ther herys
      &amp; bordyng.'<note type="foot">The Walberswick records also make one reference to a piece of
       theatrically–informed 'machinery.' The will of John Almyngham from 1500–9 requests that there
       be made 'a Canope over the hygh auter well don wyth our lady and iiij aungelys &amp; the holy
       gost goyng vp &amp; down wyth a Chyme' (JIM PLEASE PROVIDE A SHELFMARK FOR THIS RECORD)
       Almyngham’s description suggests the possibility that this was a mechanism for enacting the
       Assumption and/or Coronation of the Blessed Virgin Mary, a kind of device common in
       celebrations of the Assumption that were ubiquitous in England. See for example, the
       enactment of the Assumption and Coronation of Mary (certainly on a much bigger scale) in
       Lincoln Cathedral on St Anne’s Day (Stokes, <title>Lincolnshire</title>, vol 1, pp 118–20,
        <hi rend="italic">et passim</hi>). Peter Northeast describes several similar constructions
       in Suffolk churches ( ‘Suffolk Churches in the Later Middle Ages,’ <title>East Anglia’s
        History: Studies in Honour of Norman Scarfe</title>, Christopher Harper, Carole Rawcliffe,
       and Richard G. Wilson (eds) (Woodbridge, 2002), 100–1).</note> This payment in 1496–7
      occurred within a unique six-year period of recorded dramatic activity in which Walberswick
      received 20s from a church ale when their own game was held (1492–3); paid 3d in the same year
      when Wenhaston ‘schowyd’ its own game in Walberswick; paid 4d when Bramfield showed its game
      in Walberswick (1493–4); and collected 13s 4d from its own game (1494–5). This outburst of
      dramatic activity suggests that the staging was perhaps related to one or more of those
      events.</p>

     <head>Local Playing Circuits and Patronage</head>
     <p>The Suffolk records provide considerable evidence of inter-parish networking concerning
      their plays throughout Suffolk, south Norfolk, and north Essex (such circuits certainly did
      not stop at county borders). Records from twelve communities contain evidences of inter-parish
      playing circuits and support among eighty-two communities. Because the records are inevitably
      fragmentary, likely other instances of inter-parish cooperation in matters of custom,
      ceremony, and performance existed. Many of the places that had their own players were
      villages. To cite one example, <rs ref="eats:163205" type="Person_Male">Sir John Howard</rs>,
      of Tendring Hall in <rs ref="eats:372335" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Stoke-by-Nayland</rs>,
      paid the players of the hamlet of Thorington Street; he also hosted amateur troupes from five
      towns in Essex (Billericay, Chelmsford Coggeshall, Colchester, and Esterford), and from the
      towns of Hadleigh and Lavenham. Stoke by Nayland also networked its own parish play. The <ref
       target="https://ereed.org/search/?facet_locations_settlement_b=371513&amp;start=0&amp;facet_record_type_church=Parish"
       >Boxford churchwardens' accounts</ref> each year between 1529–30 and 1533–4 contain small
      payments for bread and drink given 'to Stoke play' (presumably gifts to men from Stoke by
      Nayland travelling to announce their play). Similarly, in <ref
       target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid155/">1535</ref> Boxford recorded that Nayland
      (five miles south of Boxford, not the same place as Stoke by Nayland) had contributed 21s 8d
      to the Boxford play.<note type="foot">London, BL: Add. MS 46349, f 102v (Stoke–by–Nayland);
       London, SA MS 76, f 84v (Thorington), f 105v (Coggeshall, Essex), f 106 (Hadleigh), f 107v
       (Esterford, Kelvedon, Essex); London, SA MS 77, f 31v Coggeshall, Essex), f 134v (Chelmsford,

       (Nayland, 5 miles south of Boxford); Cambridge, PCL: Framlingham L 2, p 41 (Billericay,
       Essex, Hadleigh and Lavenham).</note></p>

     <p>Local troupes also occasionally travelled to perform well beyond local circuits. The players
      of Hadleigh, for example, performed at Canterbury on 10 September 1538, for which they were
      paid 20d by the city chamberlain. <note type="foot">James M. Gibson (ed), <title>Kent: Diocese
        of Canterbury</title>, REED, vol 1 (London and Toronto, 2002), 149.</note></p>

     <p>The evidence of local networking among villages and towns about which we can know something
      (however fragmentary) includes the parishes of Boxford, Bungay, Dennington, Long Melford,
      Metfield, Mildenhall, Stoke-by-Nayland, Walsham-le-Willows, Wattisfield and Walberswick, and
      the fifty-nine other communities mentioned in their records.</p>

     <p>The density and ubiquity of the venues is extraordinary. Why individual networks developed
      in the ways they did defies easy answers. It appears to have been a matter of shared economic
      and historical interests, but perhaps also other local factors now less apparent to us. No one
      place (for example, Ipswich or Bury) was the single centre of dramatic activity in the county.
      Suffolk might more usefully be described as a series of micro-cultures, each with distinctive
      playing traditions within a common culture and bonds unique to each micro-culture. For
      example, as the county’s major city, Ipswich performance traditions included a civic Corpus
      Christi celebration with pageants and drama. Ipswich records have left no evidence of
      networking beyond the city. On the other hand, in the liberty of St Edmund, which encompassed
      all of west Suffolk, the management and farming of the vast manorial lands there devolved
      during the late medieval period from its manorial landlord, the abbot of Bury St Edmunds, to
      towns and villages. Glebe lands transferred by the abbot to the communities included camping
      closes, two of which (at Beccles and Walsham) included pieces of land identified in the
      records as game places, the one at Walsham certainly used for staging plays. Many communities,
      however small, had their own annual play, sometimes co-produced with their neighbors, and for
      which they travelled and advertised. Conversely, cloth-making communities in south Suffolk
      cooperated, sometimes in great number, to produce an occasional play for a community engaged
      in upgrading its church. And finally, the parts of east Suffolk controlled by the duke of
      Norfolk, notably the area north and south of the River Waveney, and from Stoke-by-Nayland to
      Framlingham, financed their own plays but provided considerable hospitality to visitors. They
      received production assistance from as far away as Norwich because of their connection there
      with their patron, the duke of Norfolk.</p>

     <p>In the interests of accuracy, it seems important to stress that Suffolk’s playing circuits
      had nothing to do with county boundaries. Notably, those in north and south Suffolk extended
      well into Norfolk and Essex. The two identified sites in Norfolk (Yarmouth and Wymondham) both
      had strong local playing traditions, and Yarmouth had a game place, which scholars have
      determined was used for plays. Playing there must have shared theatrical conventions with
      towns in north Suffolk, because both Norfolk towns lent playing gear to Suffolk productions.
      The four towns in north Suffolk and south Norfolk were similarly important, but in different
      ways. Walsham was an agricultural hub; Beccles was the most important port town on the River
      Waveney. Yarmouth was the major North Sea Port in the area; and Wymondham was an important
      market and abbey town. Thetford, in Norfolk, welcomed local players from numerous other
      Suffolk communities who were announcing their own plays. Players from a number of Essex
      communities, including Coggeshall and Chelmsford, made their way into Suffolk, as did those
      from Suffolk go into Essex. The complex matter of local playing circuits in Suffolk deserves
      considerable further study.</p>

        only in that the St Nicholas clerks were somewhat older than the boy bishops and had
        advanced into minor orders. The activities of both boy bishops and St Nicholas clerks on St
        Nicholas Day (6 December) or the feast of the Holy Innocents (28 December) were
        characteristically ‘an opportunity for disguising and role reversal, involving parody by
        choirboys and students of their techers and masters.’<note type="foot">Gibson,
          <title>Kent</title>, vol 1, pp lxxxvi–vii, and ccxi, nn 61–3.</note> The Suffolk records
        give no glimpses into the nature of the ceremony as practiced there except that it was

       <p>Christmas entertainments turn up at ten locations (primarily private households and
        religious foundations—see the section on <ref target="#drama-household">Households</ref>)
        in Suffolk records between the thirteenth century and 1573. Parish documents contain a
        paucity of references to Christmas entertainments. Most striking concerning Christmas
        entertainments is the great number of payments to amateur troupes with a named leader, and a
        troupe of between four and eight players, most of them in households and once in Ipswich.
        These troupes were often local, but they might come from places rather far afield (the
        players of Norwich or of Dunwich at Mettingham College, or the players of Coggeshall and
        Chelmsford, Essex, at Stoke-by-Nayland). A number of minstrels performed at Christmas too,
        most copiously at Mettingham College. Minstrels and players there are easily distinguishable
        in that entries for minstrels invariably just record the amount (item given to minstrels,’
        for example), the presumption being that they were making music, whereas payments to players
        (whether ‘luzori,’ the parish clerk and his fellows, or another descriptor) usually also
        indicate that the payments were for playing (‘ludentes’ or a similar form). The third
        interesting feature of the records of Christmas performances is the number of
        sizable-looking productions (see the section on <ref target="#drama-household">Households</ref>).</p>

        Boxford were perceived as being events similar in nature, although more money by far was

       <head>Summer Games</head>
       <p>In <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid665/">1363</ref>, the village of
         <rs ref="eats:372017" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Polstead</rs> recorded a play or ‘ludus’
        called a <rs ref="eats:35779" type="Entertainment_FolkCustom">summer game</rs> or
        ‘somergamen.’ Twenty later entries concerning May games occur in six Suffolk communities
        between 1478 and 1543. While fewer in number than those for other kinds of entertainments,
        the May game entries that survive indicate a robust tradition in connection with May Day. In
         <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid172/">1508–9</ref> the churchwardens at
        Mildenhall recorded income from four May ales. In <ref
         target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid173/">1509–10</ref> they paid players and a
        taborer at their May Ale. In <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid174/"
         >1510–11</ref> they recorded receipts from two May ales. In <ref
         target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid175/">1528</ref> they recorded receipts from
        a play called a May game (‘pro ludo vocato Maygame’). And in <ref
         target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid177/">1543–4</ref> they recorded receipts
        from a May Day gathering. Walberswick and nearby Blythburgh had interesting connections
        concerning May Games <!--IN: No records in the collection for Walberswick or Blythburgh-->.
        Entries in the Walberswick churchwardens’ accounts describe a May drinking; a May, with a
        church ale (the wording seemingly describing two separate activities, the former sounding
        like a May game); a May ale; and a maidens’ gathering, undated but likely a May game
        activity, since the other Walberswick entries involving women and maidens are, for the most
        part, related to the May games. In most years between 1490 and 1499 Walberswick also made
        annual payments to the May of Blythburgh, its neighbour. Monk Sohum had a May ale and
        gathering in 1565. <!--IN: No record of this in collection?-->As they survive in the
        records, May games were a custom mainly in coastal Suffolk, plus Stoke-by-Nayland, which is

        Christopher Dyer has observed that the reference to a brewer named John by his nickname,

        before 1380. He also wonders whether its use near the date of the Peasants’ Revolt date
        might ‘express lower-class antagonisms towards those in authority,’ with locals connecting
        the rumoured ‘collusion between the monks of Bury and Sir John Cavendish’ at a time when the
        struggles between the abbey and the locals in surrounding towns were explosive and violent
        (see the <ref target="#drama-household">section on Households</ref>).<note type="foot">Christopher Dyer, ‘The Rising of 1381 in Suffolk: Its Origins and

       <head>Non-Mimetic Traditions</head>
       <p>Traditions involving processions and ritualized activities were diverse in
        fifteenth-century Suffolk. None of them was more curious than the Ceremony of the White
        Bull, in Bury St Edmunds, in which a wealthy woman, unable to conceive a child, went in a
        large procession preceded by a white bull, to the Abbey where a religious ceremony praying
        for her conception occurred. (See <ref
         target="https://ereed.org/collections/suffk/appendix-2/">Appendix 2</ref> concerning
        The Ceremony of the White Bull).</p>

       <p>While it is clear that Plough Monday observances in Suffolk parishes might have ritualized
        elements, there is no evidence in the records that the observances had mimetic content.
        However, observance of Plough Monday was an important ritualistic part of parish life in
        Suffolk. Of the nineteen surviving churchwardens’ accounts from the county (some mere
        fragments), ten record Plough Monday traditions.</p>

       <p>Several of the accounts offer suggestive glimpses as to what Plough Monday observances
        might include. In Brundish ‘diverse young folks’ (perhaps a guild) gathered and presented
        contributions on Plough Day, and the parish reimbursed those that ‘yeden with the
        plowe.’<note type="foot">Ipswich, Suffolk Archives, FC 89/A2/1, Brundish St Andrew’s Churchwardens’

        presented gatherings made on Plough Day through the end of the sixteenth century, and in
        1570–1 had payments for ‘a paier of gloves for the wyttche,’ likely ‘connected with the
        festivities of Plough Monday.’<note type="foot"> Wasson and Galloway, <title>Plays and

         woman is unclear, but as the records show, the wives of the town made many gatherings, and

       <p>Every pre-Reformation Suffolk parish for which we have records produced church ales as
        their primary source of communal festivity and fund-raising. While most ales appear to have
        been typical, non-performative drinkings, in three instances they may have involved
        something more. At its ale in 1538–9, the parish of Dennington received 3s from ‘the Wycheys
        gathering,’ clearly characters of some kind being represented by someone.<note type="foot"

        Mildenhall typically recorded four ales annually (one by the town, one each by the hamlets
        of Beck Row, Holywell Row, and West Row). The ales were intertwined with a rich performative
        tradition, as evidenced in its May ales (see the <ref

       <p>When parishes had a church house or guildhall, they held their ales there. In
        Fressingfield, for example, so as to avoid any longer abusing the reverence of the parish
        church by using it for church ales, guilds, yeardays, and other drinkings, a group of
        parishioners purchased lands and properties which included what would become a Church House
        (later to become the new guildhall), where those happenings were thereafter to be
         held.<!-- IN: No records re: Fressingfield in the collection--><note type="foot">Ipswich,

       <p>While records show a great deal of inter-parish support for plays, evidence of that same
        support is sparse for ales. Huntingfield is a striking exception. In 1535–6 seven other
        communities contributed to Huntingfield’s one ale. In 1536–7 six of the same seven
        communities again contributed. Five of the parishes lay within two to three miles of
        Huntingfield; the remaining two lay about five miles away.<note type="foot">Ipswich, Suffolk

        robust festive tradition that included minstrels, a taborer, singers, and processions with
        torches and banners. It also records an obscure event called a ‘sporting’ that garnered
        ‘sporting silver.’ The nature of the event—whether it was merely something athletic, or
        involved something else, the records simply do not say. While the Creeting Jesus and Mary
        guild accounts never use the word ‘ale,’ they do include a single payment to brewers.<note

        <head>School Performance</head>
        <p>Children learned the arts of performance at every level of society, whether as part of
         formal education, as training in a craft, or as part of family life. Suffolk's secular
         grammar schools incorporated entertainments, ranging from plays to oratory, civic ceremony,
         and cockfights. At Bury school, for example, the master provided cocks on Shrove
         Tuesday.</p>
        
        <p>School drama in Suffolk could be sophisticated. The statutes of Bury school order that
         the curriculum include 'the chaster plays of Plautus and Terrance.' Suffolk schoolmasters
         served as playwrights, producers, and directors of plays that their students performed.
         Students delivered orations and otherwise contributed at civic ceremonials, sometimes to
         demonstrate proficiencies warranting their advancement. In the cloth-making village of
         Boxford, for example, the ordinances of the school dictated that before they could be
         promoted to a higher form, students must perform a speech.<note type="foot">Suffolk

          <head>Religious Houses</head>
          <p>Evidence of their great support of parish drama, custom, and music survive in the
           records of several religious houses. Most notable among them are the registers of
           <rs ref="eats:385096" type="Place_F_School">Mettingham College</rs>, which record payments to performers of every kind, from professional
           troupes to parish players, from minstrels to boy bishops, from bearwards to jesters, from
           dancers to fools, over a 250-year period. Several small priories record payments to
           parish players and waits (<rs ref="eats:373153" type="Place_F_Church">Bungay Priory</rs>), a king and queen of the May and a harpist
           (<rs ref="eats:374015" type="Place_F_ReligiousHouse">Felixstowe Priory</rs>), and professional minstrels (<rs ref="eats:379867" type="Place_F_ReligiousHouse">Ipswich Priory</rs>). Strikingly, however,
           while the abbey at Bury St Edmunds paid many important professional troupes, as well as
           its own boy bishops, surviving account rolls from the abbey record not a single payment
           to parish players or customary performers. Performers in the abbey records actually cover
           a rather narrow spectrum (professionals and boys). It seems that the amount and range of
           support for local drama and custom was not necessarily a matter of interest for the
           bigger, wealthier Bury, while it was of great interest for several other houses large and
           small. Performances at the Abbey occurred every year on three occasions: the ceremony of
           the boy bishop on the Feast of St Nicholas (6 December); the commemoration of St Edmund's
           Day (20 November), and the feast of Christmas. Abbey officials paid minstrels for
           performing in the hall in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid1/">1401–2</ref>, and a minstrel at Christmas in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid2/">1417–18</ref>. They paid the
           boy bishop in 1417–18, <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid13/">1422–3</ref>, and <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid9/">1493–4</ref>. And they rewarded minstrels on the Feast of St
           Edmund in 1417–18, <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid3/">1429–30</ref>, and <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid20/">1486–7</ref>. Through the centuries all but one of their
           payments to entertainers occurred on one of eleven feast days: St Edmund (9 times); St
           Nicholas and Easter (4 each); Christmas and the Ascension (2 each); and St John Baptist,
           St Edward, All Saints, Purification, Lent, and St Mark (1 each).</p>
          <p>Households, both secular and monastic, provided substantial patronage to performers,
           whether amateur or professional. Their patronage ranged from financial rewards and
           hospitality given to itinerant performers, to the supporting of players and musicians as
           members of their households, to the rewarding, sponsoring, and educating of children, who
           also performed. For detailed discussion of payments to professional entertainers by
           households both religious and private through the centuries, see the section on

          <p>The household accounts of Sir <rs ref="eats:163205" type="Person_Male">John Howard</rs> of Tendring Hall include payments to
           performers of nearly every kind. Amateurs paid included parish players from Hadleigh and
           Lavenham. Hadleigh players and 'ye olde man and ij children' performed at Tendring Hall
           during Christmas <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid233/">1481</ref> and four members of a Hadleigh troupe performed there on St
           Steven’s Day in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid239/">1526</ref>. The troupe may have contributed to Howard’s disguising at New
           Year’s 1526/7 since they were paid on a page containing many expenses related to the
           disguising. Howard hosted a second disguising in 1490–1<!--IN: No record for this in collection-->.</p>
          
          <p>Disguisings at Stoke-by-Nayland could be expensive and elaborate, including payments
           for costumes and gunpowder, in the Christmas season between 20 December and 2 January.
           Tendring Hall hosted numerous other Christmas entertainments as well. Amateurs of other
           kinds included St Nicholas clerks, the Children of the Chapel, a Robin Hood for whom
           Howard purchased eight shafts in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid238/">1483</ref>, and hocking by maidens on Hock Monday. He also paid amateur players
           from five towns in Essex (Billericay, Chelmsford, Coggeshall, Colchester, and Esterford).
           Howard’s payments to professionals were equally copious. He paid the Children of the
           Chapel in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid233/">1481</ref>; Gloucester’s troupe of four players in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid236/">1482</ref>; and the lord of Essex’s
           players in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid239/">1526</ref>. His payments to professionals also included other important troupes of
           players, as well as singers, musicians, bearwards, waits, jousters, tumblers, trumpeters,
           fools, and his own household performers.</p>
          
          <p>Performers who may or may not have been professionals performed at numerous other
           private households. At <rs ref="eats:373636" type="Place_PA_Manor">Brome Hall</rs> three musicians performed before Sir Thomas Cornwallis
           in February <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid212/">1560/1</ref>, as did two tumblers on 23 March. In <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid468/">1572</ref> one Adams of Bury played an

          <p>The nobility and gentry provided considerable support to children, both in their
           education and in the development of their musical skills. Both the Howards and the
           <rs ref="eats:424886" type="Person_Family">Kitsons</rs> supported local song schools with numerous payments for clothing suitable for
           choristers, a song book and anthems, and other expenses related to performances.</p>
          <p>Great lords might also undertake the patronage of individual talented children. In <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid233/">1481</ref>
           Sir John Howard of Stoke-by-Nayland paid diverse expenses related to the care of a singer
           known as <rs ref="eats:387023" type="Person_Male">Little Richard</rs>, including his initial boarding with a local priest before moving
           to Howard's residence, his costs into Sussex and other times going into London, and his
           wages. In <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid236/">1482</ref> Howard made a covenant with William Wastell of London, a harper, to teach
           the son of John Colet of Colchester, a harper, to harp and sing. The lad was then to be
           indentured into Howard's service and to retain the gown and the remains of the money
           earlier supplied by Howard. In <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid465/">1543</ref> the Kitsons of Hengrave Hall gave 11s to a Mistress

          <p>Some household musicians in Suffolk during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were
           notable indeed. The distinguished composer and madrigalist John Wilbye (1574–1638) served
           for many years as musician and musical tutor to the Kitsons at Hengrave Hall. The admired
           composer <rs ref="eats:424748" type="Person_Male">Edward Johnson</rs> (1572–1601) served the Kitsons in that same capacity. The
           musicians' chamber at Hengrave was lavishly equipped with musical instruments, related
           equipment, and music books. Musician and composer <rs ref="eats:435371" type="Person_Male">George Kirbye</rs> (d. 1634) 'was employed
           as a domestic musician at Rushbrooke Hall near Bury St Edmunds, the seat of Sir Robert
           Jermyn.' Rushbrooke Hall was but a few miles from Hengrave and it is thought that Kirbye
           'must have had personal contacts' with Wilbye. In <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid60/">1605-6</ref> the household accounts of the
           Adairs of Flixton Hall recorded rewards to the musicians 'Stubbs' and 'Connoway,' who
           appear to have been the family's household musicians, especially since they also repaired
           the family's musical instrument as required.<note type="foot"><title>The New Grove

          <head>Monastic Households</head>
          <p>Records show that several of Suffolk’s monastic households supported entertainers in
           ways comparable to those provided by the households of the nobility and gentry. Of
           monastic households, Mettingham College and the abbey of Bury St Edmunds provide the most
           copious evidence; they also present strikingly differing profiles.</p>
          
          <p>Mettingham College seemingly welcomed every entertainer who approached their doors.
           Over a 250-year period, payments in the registers of the college range from professional
           troupes to parish players, from minstrels to boy bishops and clerks of St Nicholas, from
           bearwards to jesters, from dancers to fools, from schoolmasters’ troupes of boys to
           puppet acts (one of which included eight performers), to professional performers with
           great patrons. There is no evidence in the records that performers were following rigid
           annual itineraries (although the performers of a very few great patrons showed up more
           often); rather, most performers’ visits seem occasional. Visiting performers who visited
           came from nine different communities, including nearby Beccles and Bungay (players and
           dancers from Beccles visited once, as did a taborer and three dancers from Bungay).
           Mettingham registers include seventeen payments for Christmas entertainments, many of
           them involving plays by amateur troupes.</p>
          
          <p>While Mettingham paid professionals and amateur alike, the accounts of the abbey at
           Bury St Edmunds (admittedly far fewer in number than Mettingham’s) include payments only
           to important professional troupes and the abbey’s own boy bishops. The accounts that
           survive give no evidence of cooperation between abbey and town in the production of
           performances. However, during the first half of the fourteenth century evidence of
           patronage of local professional musicians by the abbey does turn up in different kinds of
           records, including patent rolls (see the section on <ref target="#drama-household">Household entertainments</ref>; for detailed discussion of the various kinds of professionals see
           the section below on <ref target="#drama-performers">Professional Performers</ref>; for
           professional music makers in particular, see the section on <ref target="#drama-waits">Waits and Other
           Musicians</ref>). From the abbey at Bury, the 'Gifts' section of
           an account for <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid8/">1335–6</ref> includes payments (all made on eight major feast days between All
           Saints 1335 and the Ascension of the Lord in 1336) to at least twenty-five minstrels
           (none of whose patrons are identified), plus a harpist, a taborer, and seven trumpets
           (all ten of whom had noble patrons). This extraordinary fragment also includes payments
           to a juggler, bearwards, royal heralds, messengers, and yeomen of the guard. In 1335–6 at
           least, the performative landscape at Bury was littered with entertainers of almost every
           kind in an atmosphere mingling royalty, nobility, ecclesiastics, local gentry, and
           performers. Several small priories record payments to parish players and waits (Bungay
           Priory), a king and queen of the May, a harpist (Felixstowe Priory), and professional
           minstrels (Ipswich Priory ).</p>

         <div>
          <head xml:id="drama-waits">Waits and Other Musicians</head>
          <p>During the medieval and early modern periods, Suffolk was awash in music, whether by
           civic waits, minstrels, fiddlers, pipers, blind harpers, drummers, or other music makers
           variously identified by their skill with every instrument of the time. Local musicians
           and travelling professionals played in an array of complex social, ceremonial, and even
           judicial contexts.</p>
          
          <p>In the Elizabethan period, one sees a detectable hierarchy evolving among musical
           performers. Waits emerge as entrepreneurs with a license to augment their income by
           travelling to performances elsewhere, even over the seas, as happened once in Ipswich. By
           virtue of their employment by the masters and burgesses, waits came to enjoy a near
           monopoly over musical performance in towns.</p>
          
          <div>
           <head>Town Waits</head>
           <p>The records confirm that at least six Suffolk towns (Aldeburgh, Bungay, Bury, Dunwich,
            Ipswich, and Walberswick) sponsored waits. The earliest reference to a wait occurs in
            Bungay; the most detailed information occurs in Ipswich. For the other four towns, the
            few references to their waits provide but a fragmentary picture of the tradition in that
            town (see below). Many other communities and guilds retained one or more minstrels whose
            duties (performing at feasts, dinners, and ceremonies, leading processions, receiving a
            wage) mirrored those of waits. In Creeting St Mary, for example, in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid99/">1468</ref> the <rs ref="eats:375295" type="Collective_GuildsReligious">Jesus and
            Corpus Christi guild</rs> listed two minstrels as members, and also recorded payments to
            them. In 1524–5 Thetford Priory in Norfolk paid 12d to the minstrel of Wangford.<note
             type="foot">TNA: E 135/2/22, ff 1v, col 1, f 2, col 1, 24, 29, 30–61v; and Cambridge,
             University Library: Add. MSS 6969, f 173v.</note> The ambiguous wording could indicate
            either that the minstrel held a position with Wangford, or simply that he happened to
            live there.</p>
           
           <p>The records also indicate that Suffolk waits were similar in their organization and
            practices to those in other English counties. They functioned as companies controlled by
            a master. The towns hired the master who, in turn, hired and paid the members of his
            company. Generally, the company performed as a troupe within the customary life of the
            town, but individual members, most often the master, might sometimes perform, and be
            paid, alone. The company might also travel to perform elsewhere entrepreneurially, as
            permitted by the town. In addition to wages, towns paid the waits' expenses for livery
            and instruments. With the decline of travelling patronized companies during the late
            sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, towns became a more stable patron for
            musicians than were lords; while individual waits might come and go, troupes of waits
            often enjoyed a long tenure, secure in the musical monopoly provided by their town. In
            Ipswich at least, waits also sometimes performed as, and with, actors in productions. In
            <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid386/">1568–9</ref>, for example, they received 10s 'for playing the ffooles in the halle,' and in
            <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid388/">1571–2</ref> the town paid 6s 8d 'To will{i}am Martyne &amp; his companye for a plaie at the
            Mote hall.'</p>
          </div>
          <div>
           <head>ALDEBURGH</head>
           <p>The first certain reference to the <rs ref="eats:366829" type="Collective_Office">Aldeburgh waits</rs> occurs in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid26/">1573–4</ref> (though a possible
            first reference occurs in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid23/">1567–8</ref>) and entries in the records continue thereafter through
            <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid36/">1584–5</ref>. In <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid35/">1583–4</ref> a payment for their dinner confirms that the company of waits in
            Aldeburgh numbered four. Two of Aldeburgh's waits were certainly Peter Hunt and <rs ref="eats:470193" type="Person_Male">Thomas
            Brown</rs>. The third member of the company may have been John Brown, a minstrel whom the
            town paid in 1567 for fixing the clock and the dial and other work at the church. The
            fourth of the waits may have been <rs ref="eats:470712" type="Person_Male">John Bettes</rs> (later found among the Ipswich waits), who
            contributed to the care of a blind boy who would eventually become a wait. Numerous
            payments made to the Aldeburgh waits occur in connection with their care and training of
            that boy, <rs ref="eats:469550" type="Person_Male">Blind Harry</rs>, whom the waits developed as one of their own, and who grew to be
            a respected musician in the town. The waits’ involvement with Blind Harry spans more
            than twenty years in the records.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
           <head>BUNGAY</head>
           <p>In <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid79/">1443</ref> the prioress of Bungay Priory paid 4d to a minstrel who occupied the position
            of <rs ref="eats:371490" type="Collective_Office">wait in Bungay</rs>, at a play staged before her. It is the earliest reference to a local
            wait in Suffolk and the only reference to a wait in Bungay.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
           <head>BURY</head>
           <p>The town of Bury had always chafed against the abbey’s control over its affairs.
            Support for a <rs ref="eats:371945" type="Collective_Office">troupe of waits</rs> appears to reflect the town’s growing civic identity. The
            Bury waits first appear in 1537–8, one year before the dissolution of the abbey of Bury,
            when they received 12d for an appearance at Thetford Priory.<note type="foot">Cambridge,
             CUL: Add. MSS 6969, f 273.</note> At that point they disappear from the few civic
            records from Bury that survive, until the first half of the seventeenth century. In <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid90/">1621</ref>
            the feoffees of the Town Lands Trust paid for the waits' liveries (sum missing) and in
            <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid89/">1622/3</ref> they paid &#x00A3;3 7d for blue cloth for liveries and 54s 6d for silver cognizances
            for the waits. Among their other duties the waits performed at the feoffees’ feasts,
            dinners, elections, and investitures.</p>
           
           <p>One of the Bury waits certainly appears to have been '<rs ref="eats:421103" type="Person_Male">Iohn Grene</rs> the Musitian,' who

            students from Bury School regularly performed plays, orations, and verses before the
            feoffees. In <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid92/">1608</ref> a list of charges for the scholars’ play included a payment of 10s to
            the aforesaid John Green (his usual fee) 'for his Musick at the Commodye.' The wills of
            two other resident musicians in Bury (William Allgate and <rs ref="eats:426281" type="Person_StatusOther">Robert Hobart</rs>, who died
            respectively in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid565/">1642</ref> and 1644) survive, but whether the two also served as waits the

           <p>In spite of eventually fatal erosion and decline at the hands of the sea, Dunwich kept
            <rs ref="eats:376514" type="Collective_Office">companies of waits</rs> through the early decades of the seventeenth century. In <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid199/">1601</ref> the
            assembly ordered that waits Thomas Copping, Robert Alyen and company should keep the
            watch with their instruments from Michaelmas through the Purification (29 September–2
            February). In 1603 Copping and Alyen were also listed as two of the twenty-four
            burgesses of the town. An order in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid203/">1607–8</ref> confirms that companies of waits in Dunwich
            traditionally had three or more musicians. The records also indicate that Dunwich
            experienced more turnover among its waits than was usual elsewhere. After Copping and
            Alyen, town books name different masters of the waits in 1607 and again in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid207/">1613–14</ref>.
            Thereafter the waits (like the town itself) faded away forever.</p>

           <p>Although a town of Ipswich’s importance likely sponsored waits in earlier centuries,
            civic accounts from medieval Ipswich do not survive. The borough made the first
            documented payment to its <rs ref="eats:406229" type="Collective_Office">waits</rs> on <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid268/">4 November 1538</ref> when it granted an annual wage of 13s
            4d to each member of a company of three waits.<note type="foot">Nathaniell Bacon,
              <title>The Annalls of Ipswche</title> (1654), William H. Richardson (ed) (Ipswich,
             1884), 212.</note> Thereafter regular annual payments to waits begin to appear in
            <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid455/">1565–6</ref>, the point at which surviving Elizabethan accounts in Ipswich commence. During
            the Elizabethan and Stuart years successive troupes of waits enjoyed stable long term
            employment with the town.</p>
           
           <p>The first of those troupes served between 1561 and 1582, including the master wait
            <rs ref="eats:406464" type="Person_Male">William Martin</rs> and five other well-paid waits. Their most notable responsibility was to
            perform at the periodic civic meetings and feasts. In <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid262/">1575–6</ref> the chamberlain’s account
            records two separate payments to Martin, one for his salary as a wait, one for his
            salary as clerk of the market.</p>
           
           <p>With the departure of Martin and his company in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid298/">1582</ref>, the city hired an interim
            group—<rs ref="eats:411602" type="Person_Male">Thomas Keele</rs> and his company of three other waits—who served for four years, from
            1583 through 1586, when the city found its permanent replacement.</p>
           
           <p>John Bettes and his company of four (later five) other waits served for the next
            twenty years (1587–1607), far longer than any previous recorded master wait in Ipswich.
            It seems likely that Bettes had earlier served as a wait in Aldeburgh. The duties of
            Bettes and his company mirrored those of his predecessors, with the further
            clarification that between October and May they should proceed nightly ‘from two of the
            Clock’ throughout the town with their music. Throughout all his years of service to the
            town, Bettes and his company received that same annual fixed amount of &#x00A3;4 and livery
            costs, plus the right to collect additional money from audiences. In 1588–9 Bettes
            partnered with the wait <rs ref="eats:413536" type="Person_Male">Raffe Owenden</rs> (Oldham), who would stay with the company as its
            co-master through 1597. On <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid303/">2 November 1590</ref> the council permitted the two to add a fifth
            musician to their company. On the same day that Bettes was first hired in 1587 the town
            elected <rs ref="eats:473845" type="Person_Male">John Cressey</rs> (alias Mynter) as drummer of the town, to receive 20s and livery
            costs each year. Thereafter Cressey performed together with the waits many times in
            civic ceremonials.</p>
           
           <p>Bettes’ company, like William Martin's before him, contributed to dramatic and
            ceremonial productions. All the evidence of the waits’ and drummers' possible
            involvement in staging relate to the celebration of the Queen's Coronation on 17
            November, held annually between 1578 and 1600 (with a three-year lapse between 1579 and
            1582), and to the celebrations on guild days. In <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid447/">September 1578</ref> the council paid one
            John Kynge 6s 8d for charges related to the pageant he had made, and a further 40s for
            setting forth pageants both for the Guild Day and for the queen’s projected visit (which
            never actually occurred). In the following year <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid448/">(1578–9)</ref>, Kynge again supplied a pageant
            for the Guild Day, receiving &#x00A3;2 4s 8d for his efforts. William Martin received 10s for
            his music on the Guild Day. So in that year the guild celebration included both
            pageantry and music.</p>
           
           <p>John Kynge was a key figure in the Ipswich celebrations, and therefore in the
            performance life of the waits. The records identify him as both a schoolmaster and a
            scrivener, with skills in making pageants and shows. One of his shows, for the town’s
            guild merchant in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid300/">1583</ref>, was a ship pageant. Kynge produced a Coronation Day pageant and
            show one last time in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid457/">1583–4</ref>. In that same year the city paid a new schoolmaster, one Mr
            Smythe, for preparing an oration on the same Coronation Day. Martin's company of waits
            also disbanded or departed. The Coronation Day celebration then ceased for three years,
            during the temporary tenure of the new wait, Thomas Keele, and his company. The near
            simultaneous disappearance of Kynge and Martin's waits apparently made it impossible for
            the show on Coronation Day to continue in the hands of the new schoolmaster and master
            of the waits, Mr Smythe and Thomas Keele. However, the arrival of John Bettes and his
            company of waits in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid426/">1587–8</ref> coincides with the return of the Coronation Day celebration.
            In the year of their hire Bettes’ troupe received 6s 8d for 'ther servis done one the
            Quens Daye.' Another person, one Grenelefe, also received 1s 8d 'for his paines taken
            the same day,' as did the drummer John Mynter.</p>
           
           <p>The militarization of Coronation Day is apparent in the records: in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid398/">1588–9</ref> the council
            paid for paper and thread to bind up gunpowder ot the event, and at similar civic
            spectacles in 1588–9, 1589, and 1590. Coronation Day still involved some kind of
            performance at the end of the sixteenth century because on <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid459/">29 December 1599</ref> the town
            paid one <rs ref="eats:417097" type="Person_Male">William Allderton</rs> for tressels that he used in setting up the stage on the
            Queen’s Day and paid for a show by <rs ref="eats:415621" type="Person_Male">Thomas Stevenson</rs>. Coronation Day celebrations
            disappear from the records between 1600 and 1632, returning mid-reign under Charles I,
            with payments to the musicians for playing on Coronation Day between 1632 and 1637.</p>
           
           <p>In <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid277/">1608</ref> the town hired a new troupe of six waits, with the order that between
            Hallowmas and Lady Day they should progress through the town, making music with
            sackbuts, cornets, and a lute as the former musicians (John Bettes and his company) had
            done. An order in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid282/">1609</ref> identifies <rs ref="eats:417420" type="Person_Male">Thomas Salter</rs> as the master of that company. In <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid284/">1613</ref>,
            with a new master in <rs ref="eats:417892" type="Person_Male">Thomas Burrage</rs>, the company had five waits and a singing boy, hired
            with the understanding that they not ‘depa{r}t out of this towne w{i}th there musick
            w{i}thout the license of ye Bayliffes And shalbe redie at all tymes [w{i]th there
            musick w{i}thin the towne] to pleye vppon there Instrume{n}t{es}' as required by the
            bailiffs. That this order specifies that the troupe is not to travel to perform without
            a license from the bailiffs, indicates that they likely did sometimes travel to perform.
            Burrage, the longest serving master of the waits, first came into the records in 1609
            and was master from 1613 through 1637, when waits stopped appearing in the records. He
            died in 1669.</p>
           
           <p>In <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid428/">1614–15</ref>, the city paid its drummer 'for one day at ye show' so the city was still
            sponsoring stagings of some kind at that date. In that same year, the city reduced the
            wages of the waits proportionally because one of their number, <rs ref="eats:417961" type="Person_Male">Simon Myndes</rs>, was
            discharged for unlawfully begetting two children with <rs ref="eats:421710" type="Person_Female">Alice Ward</rs>. However, he was
            reinstated a year later because in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid361/">1617–18</ref>, the city paid 15s 'to make Symonde Mynd{es}
            one of the Musitians A liuerye Coate.’</p>
           
           <p>During the second half of the sixteenth century, payments to drummers increased, along
            with an increasing militarization of civic ceremonies. Drummers and their apprentices
            figured large in watches, musters, and training days at both Aldeburgh and Ipswich
            between 1575 and 1642, continuing to appear in the records long after payments to waits
            ceased.</p>

          <div>
           <head>WALBERSWICK</head>
           <p>The records of Walberswick contain only four references to their wait, all from the
            late fifteenth century, but theirs is the second earliest recorded tradition of waits
            (after Bungay) in Suffolk. Three of the references are payments (in 1469–70, 1482,
            1595–6) by churchwardens to ‘the wayte’ for work that they had hired him to do for the
            parish. In 1596–7 the wardens gave 2s to the wait as a reward, which sounds very much
            like payment for a performance. These few entries indicate that Walberswick retained at
            least one wait during the late fifteenth century, who worked for the parish as both an
            entertainer and a labourer.</p>
          </div>
         </div>
         <div>
          <head>Other Musicians</head>
          <p>Hundreds of references to other musical performers (both local and professional) turn
           up in the Suffolk records through the centuries. Through the mid-sixteenth century, the
           records most often refer to music-makers as minstrels or by their particular skill
           (lutist, harper, fiddler, trumpeter, drummer, singer, and so on). Eventually ‘minstrel’
           and other musical identifiers give way to 'musician,' the word that performers most often
           used in identifying themselves. By ‘professional,’ this collection means musicians who
           made their living as performers, and who had patrons who supported them in that endeavor.
           (For discussion of those musicians, see the sections on <ref target="#drama-performers">Professional Performers</ref>, <ref target="#drama-waits">Waits</ref>,
           and <ref target="#drama-household">Household Entertainments</ref>.) Local or amateur
           musicians, on the other hand, were otherwise-employed (often very talented) people who
           occasionally worked as performers. Often the records do not provide their names. They had
           hosts (rather than patrons) who rewarded a particular performance without having an
           apparent permanent relationship with the musician as music-maker. This discussion focuses
           on this latter category of performer. Hosts or patrons for both kinds of musicians ranged
           from towns, religious houses, gentry, members of the royal family, parishes and guilds
           (both craft and religious), innkeepers, and justices, to other individuals and
           institutions. Sometimes it is difficult to determine, from the records, whether they are
           referring to professionals or locals.</p>
          
          <p>The earliest recorded local musician in Suffolk, one Edric Vielator (fiddler), rented
           one acre of land in mid-thirteenth century Bures (near Stoke-by-Nayland). The earliest
           recorded performances, those by minstrels and other entertainers, occurred in late
           November and December 1296 and January 1296/7. During that two-month period Edward I
           chose to celebrate, in Ipswich, the nuptials and wedding of his daughter and youngest
           child, Elizabeth Plantagenet, to John I, count of Holland. <ref target="https://ereed.org/collections/suffk/appendix-1/">Royal household accounts</ref>
           record payments on that occasion to at least forty performers, including a host of
           minstrels, the dancer Matilda Makejoy, six lyrists, three videlators, two harpers, two
           trumpeters, a fool, a taborer, and at least fourteen other performers. Whether some of
           these performers were local, the records do not say.</p>
          
          <p>In the fourteenth century, professional musicians begin to proliferate in the records.
           The performative landscape of the abbey at Bury St Edmunds of that century included many
           professional minstrels in an atmosphere mingling royalty, nobility, ecclesiastics, local
           gentry, and performers. In <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid8/">1335–6</ref> an abbey account from Bury St Edmunds includes payments
           to at least twenty-five minstrels (none of whose patrons are identified), plus a harpist,
           a taborer, and seven trumpets (all ten of whom had noble patrons). In 1348 Edward of
           Woodstock, the Black Prince, awarded a war horse to a minstrel in connection with a
           <hi rend="italic">hastiludium</hi> (joust or tournament) held near the town.</p>
          
          <p>Payments to professional minstrels by religious foundations also began to emerge at
           Ipswich Priory and Mettingham College. Households, as it turns out, provide more evidence
           of local and amateur musicians than do any other kinds of documents in Suffolk. Most
           copious among households are the records of Mettingham College and the Howards of
           Stoke-by-Nayland. Particularly noteworthy are the many payments to troupes of parish
           performers, musical and otherwise, at both places. For a thorough discussion of local and
           amateur musicians, see the <ref target="#drama-household">Households section</ref>. See also
           the records (insofar as they survive) of Suffolk parishes.</p>
          
          <p>During the fifteenth century, the number of musical entertainers in Suffolk grows into
           the hundreds, turning up in the increasingly copious records of religious houses, private
           households, towns, and parishes. In Bury, for example, rent rolls of the sacrist of the
           abbey (the official responsible for the abbey’s many properties in the town) include the
           names of harpers and trumpeters who lived there in the early to mid-fifteenth century and
           early sixteenth century.<note type="foot">BL: Harley 58, ff 8v, 14v, 36, and 81; and
            Bury, Suffolk Archives, A6/2/1, p 43.</note> Payments to minstrels by religious houses
           during the fifteenth century included those by the Abbey at Bury in nearly every one of
           their account rolls that survives; in a play at Bungay Priory in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid79/">1443–4</ref>; and to a
           ‘citharedus’ (a lyrist accompanying himself with song) in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid215/">1497–8</ref> by Felixstowe Priory at
           their Christmas feast. The greatest number of musical entertainers turn up in the
           unbroken registers of Mettingham College, which record payments to music makers in nearly
           every year between 1400 and 1500. During the fifteenth century professional entertainers
           increasingly turn up in the households of the nobility and the gentry. In <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid193/">1402</ref> <rs ref="eats:451317" type="Person_Male">Thomas de
           Mowbray</rs>, fourth earl of Norfolk, of Framlingham Castle, took into service the harper,
           <rs ref="eats:447013" type="Person_Male">Simon Huittebone</rs>. In <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid192/">1408/9</ref> a household account of <rs ref="eats:451938" type="Person_Male">Michael de la Pole</rs>, second earl of
           Suffolk, of Wingfield, includes a section called 'ffeoda ministrall{is},' that is, a
           section of regular fees being paid to de la Pole's own entertainers, which included a
           trumpeter, a player of the bumbard, and two shalmosers or players of shawms. Another
           section of the same account includes a payment to four minstrels of the earl of Somerset. In 1412–13 an account of Dame <rs ref="eats:451250" type="Person_Female">Alice de
           Bryene</rs> of Acton Hall near Long Melford contains fifteen payments to musicians between
           Christmas Day and 27 July in that accounting year (four of them to minstrels, ten to
           harpers, most of them between Christmas and Lent).</p>
          
          <p>Richest in entertainers among the nobility are the household accounts of Sir John
           Howard, first duke of Norfolk, of Stoke-by-Nayland. Between 1462 and 1467 alone he made
           eleven payments to troupes of minstrels, all but two of them having three to six members
           and important patrons. The remaining three minstrels whom he rewarded, encountered during
           Howard's travels between 1462 and 1467, had no known patrons. He also paid singers,
           trumpeters, waits, harpers, and fiddlers, not to mention hockers, taborets, heralds,
           players, clerks of St Nicholas, and bearwards, for performances at Stoke-by-Nayland and a
           number of other places. The patrons included the king (twice); the lords of Oxford, St
           John, Suffolk, and Warwick; Howard himself; and the village of Polstead. Between 1481 and
           1483 Howard paid the minstrels of the Lords Gloucester and Buckingham, and Lady Norfolk;
           the towns of Colchester, Hadleigh, and Harkstead; and a gentleman (Mr Woodes); other
           minstrels who had no patron; and his own household musicians. During those two years, he
           also paid waits, singers, harpers, children of the chapel, trumpeters, schalmers, piper,
           and taborers. One <rs ref="eats:398683" type="Person_Male">Thomas Stowe</rs>, 'the mynstrell of hadleyth [Hadleigh]' performed twice
           for the Howards at Stoke-by-Nayland, in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid237/">1483</ref>, as had the minstrels of Colchester, Essex,
           in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid236/">1482</ref>. Howard even made a covenant with a London harper to apprentice the son of a
           Colchester harper for a year to teach him to harp and to sing.</p>
          
          <p>Finally, in fifteenth-century records local minstrelsy begins to emerge in the records
           of towns and villages. In <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid252/">1470</ref> the city of Ipswich ordered that players and pipers who
           performed at the council's dinners should be paid by a collection taken at the dinner. In
           <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid100/">1496–7</ref> the Jesus and Corpus Christi guild in the village of Creeting St Mary paid one
           Hert and a taborer, both of whom it called minstrels. Thereafter, in every year between
           1500 and 1538 the guild paid an unnamed minstrel and a banner bearer for what must have
           been the guild's procession. The greater number of the minstrels in all these
           fifteenth-century records had identifiable patrons, but we have almost no evidence of
           their repertoires. The one exception is a fifteenth-century manuscript song book,
           originally the property of an unnamed Ipswich minstrel.<note type="foot">Oxford, Bodl.:
            MS Eng. Poet.e.1. See also a microfilm copy (reference J479) of the original manuscript
            book at SRO, Ipswich. Written on paper in English and Latin, it has 64 leaves (including
            10 preliminary pages) measuring 150mm x 110mm (text area average 115mm x 65mm). It bears
            the name of a later owner, William Roberts, 1574, on f 62v, and was purchased by the
            Bodleian Library in 1887. During the nineteenth century, it was repaired and bound in a
            hard cover. The book is a collection of song lyrics, some with parts, some in quatrains
            (aaaa, bbbb, and so on); several pages of musical notation; and one drawing or figure.
            Most of the songs are spiritual in nature.</note> The great social, political, and
           religious tumult of the first half of the sixteenth century changed the musical landscape
           in Suffolk. With the dissolution of religious houses, musicians and other Suffolk
           performers abruptly lost major venues and income. At the same time, the word 'minstrel'
           was giving way to 'musician' in the records. While patrons and hosts most often referred
           to the entertainers as 'minstrels,' the entertainers increasingly referred to themselves
           as 'musicians’ (see below). Further, it is not always clear, especially in medieval
           records where the term was ubiquitous, that ‘minstrel’ was always referring to a
           musician. It might just as well refer to a troupe of professional players. However, in
           guild and parish records the term clearly referred to music-makers. In the village of
           Bardwell, for example, the <rs ref="eats:367530" type="Collective_GuildsReligious">guild of St Peter</rs> paid wages to three minstrels in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid147/">1511</ref>. In
           the village of Creeting St Mary the guild of Jesus and Mary did much the same. In <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid99/">1468</ref>
           (the year it was founded) the guild had made annual payments to 'the minstrel,' and it
           would do so until its record ceased in 1538. It listed two minstrels among its original
           members. In 1542 the maker of a will identified himself as 'Iohn Bannok otherwyse callid
           Barbour the mynstrell of Stradbrook.' William Guyblon, of Sudbury, referred to himself in
           his will as a minstrel in 1552, as did Daniel Wade, minstrel, of Westleton as late as
           1607.</p>
          
          <p>But elsewhere the word 'minstrel' began to disappear. Ipswich presents an interesting
           case in the evolution of the two terms. Early in the reign of Elizabeth I city accounts
           and minute books used the two terms alternatingly in referring to the town's waits. The
           master of the waits was 'the minstrel' in most years between 1557–8 and 1575–6, but he
           was 'the musician' in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid270/">1565</ref> and <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid441/">1571–2</ref> 
           and was paid for his music (not his minstrelsy) in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid446/">1576–7</ref> and <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid450/">1580–1</ref>. The records alternate terms in
           the same way when referring to the troupe of waits collectively. The records also refer
           to two other musical performers who had run afoul of the law as 'minstrels' (in 1555 and
           1573).</p>
          
          <p>After 1576 'minstrel' disappears almost entirely from the Ipswich records. The records
           do refer to the blind minstrel who received 16d in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid397/">1583–4</ref>, and to one '<rs ref="eats:318436" type="Person_Male">Iohn Iohnson</rs>
           mynstrell for taking paines in the ma{r}ket by the direcc{i}on of Mr Bailiff{es},' who
           received 20s (though whether for music or something else is not clear), but the city
           thereafter refers to its musical performers as musicians or waits only. The term
           'minstrel' also disappears concerning itinerant professionals. The impression arises that
           as a term of art, 'minstrel' eroded in Ipswich, being increasingly used to indicate a
           person of lower performative rank among musical entertainers.</p>
          
          <p>The shift from 'minstrel' to 'musician' in the Suffolk records coincides with a complex
           historical moment, culturally speaking. Entertainers increasingly came to depend on
           towns, villages, the non-cloistered church, and private households for patronage. As the
           sixteenth century neared its end, only a few towns, the royal family, and a very few
           great noblemen continued to sponsor travelling performers, the effect, no doubt, of
           restrictions on patronage imposed by the Crown.<note type="foot">Between 1580 and 1617
            the Crown issued a great number of statutes, proclamations and orders exerting
            ever-tightening control over entertainments. For the range and nature of these actions
            during those years, see E.K. Chambers, ‘Appendix D: Documents of Control,’
             <title>Elizabethan Stage</title>, vol 4 (Oxford, 1923), 278–345. Of particular note
            therein, see Minutes of the Privy Council on 25 July 1591 (prohibition of enterludes and
            plays on Sundays and Thursdays); 'An Act for the Punishment of Rogues, Vagabonds and
            Sturdy Beggars on 9 February 1598' (specifically defining performers of all kinds as
            rogues and vagabonds); 'An Act for Continuance of the Act Against Vagabonds of 1598,’
            made on 7 July 1604; and 'An Act to Restrain Abuses (Prophanations) of Players on 27 May
            1606.' While making it impossible for most players to perform, the Crown issued patents
            between 1604 and 1611, giving permission to royal troupes and a few select others to
            travel and perform as they would (Chambers, <title>Elizabethan Stage</title>, pp 307,
            324-5, 336–7, 338-9, and 340–42).</note> As the number of patrons was declining, musical
           performers, now identifying themselves as musicians, emerged from anonymity. In 1580–1 in
           Orford, for example, performer George Cowper of Ipswich, in bringing suit for disturbing
           the peace against one John Paynter, identified himself as a musician.<note type="foot"
            >Orford Civic Act Book, Ipswich, Suffolk Archives: EE 5/2/1.</note> It appears that
           'musician' bestowed independent entrepreneurial identity and a craftsman's level of
           skill, whereas 'minstrel' often came with anonymity and a degree of servitude to the
           patron. The amount of detail about musicians, their instruments, and their position in
           society grew exponentially in wills, family papers, and civic records. Composers appeared
           in the records. Whether or not this greater amount of evidence always reflects a general
           rise in the quality of musicianship is less than certain: in preparing the celebration of
           All Saints Day in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid316/">1638</ref>, the burgesses of Ipswich found it necessary to order the bailiffs
           to 'p{r}ovide the best Musicke they Canne gett to playe Afore them.'</p>

          <p>The records certainly leave the impression that musicians were developing an
           independent identity as professionals who aspired to be (or were) gentlemen. For example,
           <rs ref="eats:431597" type="Person_Male">William Firmage</rs>, musician and musical tutor, of Rougham near Bury (d. 1622), was able to
           bequeath to his friends and associates a set of English and Italian madrigals in
           manuscript; a set of Latin motets and other sets of printed and manuscript singing books;
           a base viol with its case, with books of viol lessons both printed and manuscript; and
           sets of books of fancies and Latin motets. At the same time, he made considerable
           bequests to relatives. See also musician gentlemen John Roke, of Aldringham; and William
           Allgate, widower, of Bury (d. 1642). For three persons not identified as musicians but
           who left musical instruments to their children, see <rs ref="eats:451464" type="Person_Male">John Pettaugh</rs>, of Framsden; <rs ref="eats:381963" type="Person_Male">Barnabas
           Gibson</rs>, of Haughley; and <rs ref="eats:471985" type="Person_Female">Marian Lyster</rs>, widow, of Alpheton.</p>
          
          <p>There is ample indication that musical entertainers in Suffolk contributed to drama,
           custom, and ceremony, although the precise nature of those contributions is often murky
           because of vagueness in the records.</p>
          
          <p>The earliest possible evidence occurs in payments made at Ipswich on 1 January 1296/7
           to three minstrels named 'Grisecote / Visage, &amp; Magote Menestrall{i}s performing
           [before the Lady Elizabeth].' Their names sound like characters rather than given names,
           suggesting that their minstrelsy involved role-playing of some kind, pehaps farcical,
           before the royal bride-to-be. Also at this celebration, among a group of minstrels paid
           on the day of the nuptuals, was 'Thome le ffol,' suggesting the likelihood of a
           performance incorporating music and mimetic comic activity.</p>
          
          <p>Performances combining minstrelsy and play occurred at religious houses as well. In
           <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid594/">1404-5</ref> Mettingham College paid a minstrel performing with a horse. It is hard to imagine
           this event as drama, but it certainly involved a dialogue of some sort between man and
           beast. On seven occasions between 1469–70 and 1522–3 the college paid minstrels and
           lusores (amateur local players) together. Visiting minstrels performed with entertainers
           other than players, including fools, bears, and jugglers six times between 1467–8 and
           1523–4.</p>
          
          <p>In Bury in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid92/">1608</ref> the governors of King Edward School awarded John Greene the Musician
           10s 'for his Musick at the Com{m}odye.' They paid him the same amount in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid86/">1619/20</ref>. Given
           the pattern of payments by villages and towns, minstrels made central contributions in
           customary processions—events that had mimetic elements.</p>
          
          <p>Because of their institutional nature, the records tend to identify musicians who had
           patrons. However, a great many other musicians who had no apparent patron turn up as
           well. The records mention a few blind minstrels, exclusively in and under the care of
           towns. So do they mention boys, who are apprenticed to musicians, primarily waits. The
           records also reveal several instrument suppliers, instrument makers and repairers of
           instruments whom fathers bequeath musical instruments—often virginals; but in the wills
           of professional musicians, in Suffolk it is always the son(s) or other male relatives who
           receive the instruments and supplies. Most striking is the evolving role of patrons and
           sponsors, who changed with the times. In the medieval period the town of Ipswich, the
           religious houses of Bury and Mettingham College, and the powerful local religious guilds
           served as major hosts. But with the dissolution of the monasteries, the dismantling of
           local guilds and chantries, and the near disappearance of the nobility as patrons, the
           most reliable patrons and hosts became towns as the sixteenth century neared its end,
           until puritan residents impeded even that activity. Itinerancy and sustained, reliable,
           playing circuits eroded and decayed away. In Suffolk, the greatest enemy of the inherited
           musical culture became the increasingly vicious and inhibiting wars of ideology,
           religion, and politics.</p>

          <head xml:id="drama-performers">Professional Performers</head>
          <p>Performances by travelling professional troupes of actors and musicians, and individual
           performers of many kinds show up in the records of every period for which documents
           survive. Professional performers first appear in the Suffolk records at a singular event
           in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid671/">1296</ref>. On 27 December of that year in Ipswich, in the presence of Edward I, more than
           fifty professional entertainers performed at a celebration to honor the nuptials of the
           king's daughter, Elizabeth Plantagenet, and John I, Count of Holland. The couple would
           marry on 8 January 1296/7 in Ipswich.</p>
          
          <p>All other references to professional troupes and individual performers occur between
           1366 and 1642. During those years, 171 professional troupes visited Suffolk a recorded
           508 times. Of these 171 troupes, 156 of their patrons were individual lords, nine were
           towns, one was the diocese of Lincoln, and five remain unidentified. These travelling
           professionals visited five towns, four households of the nobility, one castle, a village
           and two large religious houses—thirteen Suffolk places in all. The professional
           performers visited the towns of Aldeburgh, Bury, Dunwich, Ipswich, and Sudbury most
           often—a total of 294 times; 220 of that 294 were to Ipswich. The players visited the
           religious houses of Bury St Edmunds and Mettingham College a total of 165 times—the
           second greatest number of visits by professional toupes and individuals; but
           professionals also visited Ipswich Priory. For example, in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid323/">1360–1</ref> Ipswich Priory awarded
           8s to the minstrels of diverse lords.</p>
          
          <p>Most of those visits (140) to religious households were to Mettingham College. Between
           1396 and 1536 Mettingham made 211 payments to professional performers, whom it identified
           as minstrels. Since the payment might be to an individual minstrel or to a troupe of
           minstrels, the actual number of minstrels who performed is far greater than the 211
           payments. Before the time of Henry VIII, the Mettingham registers always identify the
           performers with noble patrons as minstrels. Lacking other descriptive distinctions, it is
           impossible to know with certainty that those minstrels were always musicians. The college
           also paid a ‘citharedi,’ a luter, mimi (performers or waits), and symphoniste (a
           musician) (all one time each).</p>
          
          <p>Of the 211 payments to minstrels, 184 mention patrons who were members of the nobility
           or the monarchy (twenty-eight were patrons whose performers visited often). The four
           noble patrons whose minstrels were paid most often all had local connections —Lord
           Willoughby (twenty times), Lord Morley (fifteen), the dukes of Norfolk (fourteen), and
           the duke of Suffolk (twelve); the king's minstrels visited more than those of any other
           patron (nineteen times). Eight of the remaining patrons of minstrels included six towns,
           one diocese, and one unidentifiable place. Of the 211 payments to minstrels in the
           Mettingham registers, the remaining nineteen mention no patron, either identifying the
           minstrel by name only or giving no indication of the minstrel's identity. Of the dated
           performances, twenty-seven occurred at Christmas, four on the college's community day,
           one at Shrovetide, and one at Pentecost. Nearly all dated payments went to players only,
           or to minstrels and players together, but only rarely to minstrels only. None of the many
           other payments bear a specific date of performance.</p>
          
          <p>The number of minstrels sponsored by a noble patron varied from one to an indeterminate
           several. These minstrels never demonstrably received payments for performing with locals
           although minstrels lacking a noble patron did do so. Because the Mettingham College
           records so consistently distinguish minstrels from other performers, the impression
           arises that in those records minstrels likely (but not demonstrably) were musicians.
           Whether they were musicians or players, the word 'minstrel' appears in most cases to have
           conveyed a measure of professional identity and a level of musical skill that warranted a
           patron's protection and ensured his or its satisfaction with the performer. Identifying
           minstrels, both solo and troupes, by name in payments appears to be an acknowledgment of
           their status or their skill, or their familiarity, for example: Nicholas, minstrel of
           Lord Willoughby in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid609/">1419–20</ref>, or <rs ref="eats:454463" type="Person_Male">Nicholas Scarlet</rs> in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid634/">1463–4</ref>. Unless minstrels were players
           in minstrels' clothing (which is quite possible), no itinerant troupes of professional
           actors identified as such are confirmably recorded at Mettingham, though many troupes of
           local players are. But the fifteenth-century abbey at Bury differs utterly from
           Mettingham in that its surviving accounts include many professional performers but
           absolutely no payments to local festive performers or unsponsored entertainers of other
           kinds.</p>
          
          <p>Professional troupes visited Acton Hall, Hengrave Hall, and Stoke-by-Nayland a total of
           forty-seven times, and visited Framlingham Castle and the village of Cratfield once each.
           Surprisingly perhaps, only this one Suffolk village records a payment to a professional
           troupe: in Lincolnshire, for example, large villages routinely paid travelling
            players.<note type="foot">See Stokes, <title>Lincolnshire</title>, vol 1, pp
            438–43.</note> Finally, the players of the duke of Suffolk (Charles Brandon) and his
           wife, styled ‘The French Queen,’ who lived at Westhorpe, Suffolk, visited Thetford
           Priory, just across the border in Norfolk, five times.</p>
          
          <p>From the records that survive it is possible to glimpse a few likely routes travelled
           by the professional troupes, mainly following ancient roadways. One (for which there is
           the most compelling evidence) is a north-south coastal route from Ipswich to Aldeburgh to
           Dunwich. Players using this route could have come into Suffolk from Essex by way of
           Colchester, Sudbury, or Stoke-by-Nayland (home of the dukes of Norfolk), and carried on
           after Dunwich into Norfolk via Yarmouth or Bungay. The records suggest a second
           north-south route, from Stoke-by-Nayland north to Sudbury, Bury St Edmunds, and Thetford.
           The records also suggest an east-west route from Cambridge (or the Midlands) to
           Newmarket, Bury, Framlingham Castle, and (veering southeast) Ipswich. The players who are
           recorded generally visited conveniently situated towns, powerful religious houses, or the
           residences of great lords. The east-west route Cambridge to Ipswich, and the south-north
           route (including its two branches) from Essex into Suffolk were all principal roads.
           While the route from Ipswich to Aldeburgh and Dunwich could not be called a principal
           road, it was the one preferred by travelling companies.<note type="foot">For a thoroughly
            researched visual representation of the major roads in medieval and early modern
            Suffolk, see https://reed.library.utoronto.ca/maps<!--IN: Not sure where this link is supposed to go. Currently a dead link.-->.</note>
          </p>
          <p>Players representing a group of seventeen patrons made the greatest number of visits:
           those of various queens visited sixty-three times; those of kings fifty-one times; and
           those of the various dukes of Norfolk forty-nine times. Of the fourteen remaining patrons
           in this first group, five were from Essex; three from Suffolk; and two from Norfolk. Only
           four of this fourteen were from elsewhere in the kingdom. Royals aside, the pattern in
           the number of visits shows a strong regional bias: the patrons of those troupes that
           visited most often lived in East Anglia.</p>
          
          <p>Sixteen other troupes in a second group each visited three times. Of that sixteen, the
           patrons of three were from Essex and three from Suffolk. The remaining ten patrons in
           that group of sixteen were from places far afield from East Anglia.</p>
          
          <p>Twenty other troupes each visited twice. Ten of their patrons were from the four East
           Anglian counties. Ten others, from elsewhere in the kingdom, all had nationally important
           patrons (Beauchamp, Buckingham, Somerset, Strange, Warwick, Westmoreland, and so on).</p>
          
          <p>Finally, of the 171 professional troupes that were paid during these years, fifty-four
           visited only once each. They came from just about everywhere, including East Anglia.</p>
          
          <p>Several summary impressions arise from the records of visits by professional
           performers. First, in comparison with some other counties, an extraordinarily high number
           of professional performers received payments in Suffolk. Second, the greatest number of
           those paid troupes came from Suffolk and other parts of East Anglia. Third, the great
           number of those East Anglian patrons came into Suffolk from Essex, indicating very close
           bonds between those two neighbouring counties. Finally, a number of payments went to
           household professionals whose patrons were women. In addition to the various queens,
           those patrons included, for example, the <rs ref="eats:32204" type="Collective_Titles">duchess of York</rs> and the <rs ref="eats:163050" type="Collective_Titles">duchess of Suffolk</rs>,
           among other great ladies (see the section on <ref target="#drama-women">Women as Patrons and Performers</ref>).</p>
          
          <p>Children also apprenticed with professional troupes of adult actors, or performed in
           troupes comprising children only. The queen's players 'being the Childeren' received 20s
           for a performance in Ipswich in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid425/">1586–7</ref>. The <rs ref="eats:437031" type="Collective_Troupe">Children of the Revels</rs> performed in Sudbury
           in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid542/">1618–19</ref> (three of them, it appears), and again in 1632.</p>
          
          <p>The Suffolk records use eleven terms (seven of them Latin) to identify performers. The
           earliest two of the terms are minstrel or ‘ministrallus’ (from 1389 to 1536–7, and
           ‘lusor’ (from 1445 to 1531–2). Both disappear from the records in the same decade. It is
           often difficult to know whether minstrel refers to a musician or an actor, but ‘lusor’
           seems always to refer to an actor or puppet player. During the first three quarters of
           the fifteenth century, minstrel and ‘lusor’ never appear in the same year, making it
           possible that both refer to players during that period. But thereafter they do
           occasionally appear in the same year. Their joint appearances in these later decades
           suggest that 'minstrel' was now more likely to refer to a musical performer than to a
           player.</p>
          
          <p>After the 1530s the term ‘player’ takes over. Many more of the documents are in
           English, but when they are in Latin, ‘ministrallus’ has given way to ‘iocator’ or
           ‘histrio.’ Players might also be called servants, men, women or youths—but never minstrel
           in these later records. When musicians are identified, the description is specialized (a
           player of a ‘citharedo,’ or a taborer). My conclusion is that throughout most of the
           fifteenth century, ‘lusor,’ player, and men (when the context clearly indicates that the
           men are performers, rather than a patron’s administrative officers or servants of his or
           her household, as for example, when the men were paid for performing at Christmas, which
           happened in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid595/">1405–6</ref> at Mettingham College) all meant the same thing—an actor, and that
           ‘ministrallus’ increasingly came to mean musician.</p>
          
          <p>Payments to a few <rs ref="eats:21804" type="Entertainer_Type">keepers of animals</rs> occur in several household records. In November
           <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid240/">1462</ref> Sir John Howard of Stoke-by-Nayland, chamberlain to the duke of Norfolk, paid Lord
           Stanley's bearward 6s 8d, and in December of the same year he paid an unnamed bearward
           (perhaps in London). In <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid246/">1464</ref> he gave a gift of 40d to his own bearward that 'kepeth my
           ber.' The bearwards of Charles Brandon, duke of Suffolk, who lived at Westhorpe, Suffolk,
           received payments from Thetford Priory (on the Norfolk-Suffolk border) in 1514-5 and
           1527-8. The Kitsons of Hengrave Hall paid the keeper of a bear from Leicestershire in
           <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid463/">1541</ref> (patron unidentifed). They also paid the keeper of the lions on <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid473/">19 February 1575</ref>,
           and a man for bringing the apes in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid475/">August 1575</ref>, both incidences in London.</p>

           <head xml:id="drama-women">Women and Performance</head>
           <p>The records present contradictory glimpses of women and performance in Suffolk during
            the medieval and early modern periods, as they do elsewhere. Through the mid-sixteenth
            century, women in Suffolk demonstrably participated (as players, producers, and patrons)
            in every performative aspect of culture, ranging from public, customary, and civic
            performance by parishes and towns to quasi-public masques to private musical
            performances within the households of the nobility and the gentry, in a culture that had
            traditionally assumed and accepted the contributing presence of women in them all,
            however patriarchal other features of society might be. However, a sometimes violent
            backlash driven by religious ideology inhibited women's (and men's) unlicensed
            performance from the late sixteenth through the mid-seventeenth centuries. East Anglian
            legal records provide vivid, sometimes horrific, examples of social conflicts involving
            women and performance that reflect a moment of great cultural change in which efforts to
            suppress most festive and performative elements of traditional culture coincided with an
            end to the acceptance of women in performance. The result is a complex documentary
            picture of women and performance in Suffolk.</p>

            <head>Women as Patrons</head>
            <p>Minstrels and other performers sponsored by women of the nobility and the royal
             families turn up in Suffolk records from the fifteenth through the first thirty years
             of the seventeenth centuries. In the early fifteenth-century Alice de Bryene of Acton
             Hall made numerous payments to harpers and minstrels, stipulating that many of them had
             performed the entire day. Mettingham College paid the minstrels of the queen (Elizabeth
             Woodville, Queen Consort of Edward IV) in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid645/">1469</ref> and <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid499/">1488</ref>; of the <rs ref="eats:453721" type="Collective_Troupe">duchess of Norfolk</rs>
             (Katherine Neville) in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid641/">1466</ref>, <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid659/">1476</ref>, and 1481; and of the duchess of York (Cecily
             Neville) in 1478 and 1488. Thetford Priory in Norfolk paid (in 1521, 1527, and 1530)
             the entertainers (jocatores) of 'the French Queen,' (Mary Tudor, duchess of Suffolk),
             who lived at Westhorpe Hall, Suffolk. In <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid464/">1542</ref> the Kitsons of Hengrave Hall twice paid a
             reward to the <rs ref="eats:424549" type="Collective_Troupe">fool of Lady Rich</rs> (Elizabeth Jenks), wife of Robert, the first Baron
             Rich.</p>
            <p>By the mid-sixteenth century, noble and royal women were keeping players rather than
             minstrels. In <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid382/">1562</ref> and <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid383/">1563</ref> Ipswich twice paid the <rs ref="eats:173596" type="Collective_Troupe">players of the duchess of Suffolk,
             Katherine Willoughby</rs> (who then lived at Grimsthorpe Castle, Lincolnshire). The <rs ref="eats:406335" type="Collective_Troupe">players
              of Queen Mary</rs> performed at Ipswich in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid339/">1556</ref> and <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid436/">1558</ref>. The <rs ref="eats:17169" type="Collective_Troupe">players of Queen Elizabeth</rs>
             performed thirty-three times at Ipswich, between 1562 and 1603. <rs ref="eats:17474" type="Collective_Troupe">Queen Anne of Denmark's

            <head>Women and Private Performance</head>
            <p>The royals had always come to Suffolk, in the process generating records of
             performance by women (both professional and amateur) spanning a wide temporal range.
             During the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries, the famous dancer and
             acrobat, Matilda Makejoy, twice perfomed in Suffolk: on <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid671/">27 December 1296</ref> before Lord
             Edward, son of King Edward I, in Ipswich, and in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid670/">1311</ref> together with one William Pilke
             and his partner (or his wife) (both minstrels) before the princes Thomas and Edmund at
             Framlingham Castle.<note type="foot">Two further items provide examples of possible
              performance by women and girls in royal settings. In <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid674/">1347–8</ref>, as part of expenses by
              the Black Prince for tournaments, his wardrobe accounts include numerous payments for
              garments for the ladies of the court at hastiludi at numerous locations in the
              kingdom, which would seem to indicate that women of the royal family and the nobility
              played a part of an indeterminate kind in the tournament (TNA: E 36/278). See also

              pp 70, 86-7, 94-5, 254-5. When Elizabeth I visited Hengrave Hall near Bury in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid187/">1578</ref>,
              the celebration mounted by the Kitsons included ‘A shew representing the Phayries’
              (Churchyard, <title>A discovrse</title>, <title>STC</title>: 5226), There seems little
              reason to believe that women and girls did not perform in that show, since provincial
              performances before the Queen characteristically did so.</note> In <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid483/">1620</ref> a group of
             Suffolk ladies invited the king and court at <rs ref="eats:384758" type="Place_PA_Settlement">little Saxham</rs> 'to a maske of theyre owne
             inuention, (all those faire sisters being summoned for the purpose)' at Bury St
             Edmunds. Suffolk had numerous regionally and nationally important families whose
             household papers record a rich musical culture centered around women. In 1593, at
             Hengrave Hall, Lady Elizabeth Kitson 'danced all this last night as long as she was
             able to go.' Household accounts include payments for stringing Lady Kitson's lute; to a
             man for bringing her a lute; to one Maud for amending the virginals; and to a man for
             teaching the children (boys and girls) of the household to play the virginals. The
             accounts of the Adairs of Flixton paid one Charles' wife for exchanging a harp. <rs ref="eats:450098" type="Person_Female">Lady
             Anne Drury</rs>, daughter of Nicholas Bacon of Redgrave, included in her inventory a pair of
             virginals and a viol belonging to her. Yeoman families followed the same pattern. In
             <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid216/">1620</ref> John Pettaugh of Framsden, bequeathed his virginals to his daughter <rs ref="eats:449747" type="Person_Female">Katherine</rs>. In

            <head>Women and Local Performance</head>
            <p>Women’s involvement in local drama and custom––as performers, organizers, and
             sponsors––was simply a universal part of parish life in Suffolk. Records indicate that
             it was a life to which the nobility and ecclesiastical institutions lent their support.
             The personal accounts of John Howard, duke of Norfolk show him giving rewards to the
             maidens of Colchester on <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid235/">12 May 1482</ref>; to the maidens of Newgate on 14 May; and ‘to
             women on hoc Monday.’ In <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid230/">1465</ref> he had given a gift to the hoc pot, which appears to be
             the name given to the pot used for collections at Hocktide. In <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid215/">1497–8</ref> the prior of
             Felixstowe Priory gave a payment to the king and queen of the May. The prioress of
             Bungay Priory gave rewards to players from Bungay town in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid78/">1406-7</ref>, and to a town wait
             who had played before her in an interlude in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid79/">1443–4</ref>.</p>
            
            <p>Local religious guilds in Suffolk enfranchised participation by women in the common
             culture. The charter of the Corpus Christi guild in Bury directs that the brothers and
             sisters of the guild convene together to honour the Body of Christ on Corpus Christi
             Day and other festivals each year and that they maintain a play. In the Ipswich civic
             minute books, innumerable orders confirm that the brothers and sisters of the guild
             merchant (also called the guild of Corpus Christi) bore joint responsibility for the
             city’s Corpus Christi procession and play. In 1475–6, in Creeting St Mary, one
             ‘Ioha{n}na Wildebeff hath gevin ou{er} to the behove of the Gylde holde in Creting A
             Torche.’ The parish accounts of Bardwell include a <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid147/">list of the brothers and sisters of
             the guild of St Peter</ref>. Involvement by women and girls in parish customs, as
             churchwardens’ accounts confirm, occurred whether a religious guild was involved or
             not, and most often in relation to May games. For typical examples concerning May
             games, see Mildenhall and Walberswick. Ales in both those places featured performances by women and maidens. In Bungay the parish <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid138/">recorded</ref>
             twenty-one shillings five pence ‘made by the wif{es} for the game,’ and in 1538–9 one
             of the two torch reeves of Bungay, named as reponsible for all gatherings in 1538–9,
             was a woman, the widow Stroger. In Aldeburgh the town paid six pence ‘to ye wemen yat
             went ye circuit of p{ro}cession’.<!--IN: Can't find record for this--></p>

            <head>Attacks on Women as Performers</head>
            <p>Ironically and unintentionally, attacks on women's performance in late sixteenth- and
             early seventeenth-century legal records confirm the central presence of women in local
             drama, custom, and ceremony up to that time. This demonization of women in performance
             became the central feature of a larger ideological attack on inherited English culture,
             abetted in its efforts by some opportunistic male performers, as a letter from
             Newmarket in 1620 testifies: ‘our pulpits ring continually of the insolence and
             impudence of women, and to helpe the matter forward the players haue likewise taken
             them to taske, and so the ballades and ballad-singers....’</p>
            
            <p>The records vividly document suppressive attacks, both verbal and physical, on women,
             which intentionally invert the traditional performative world, turning punishment of
             women into a 'comic' performance. In traditional culture, customary performance
             characteristically elevated women to central roles – most notably as May or harvest
             queens, as leaders of long dances, as processional leaders (with their daughters) in
             Ascension Day activities, or as leaders of hocktide festive collections. Instead, these
             punishments (as in the case of some skimmingtons) parodied and mocked that elevation of
             women, making them chastened ‘stars’ of their own punishment in what became a theatre
             of cruelty. A case from the court of Star Chamber vividly illustrates the process.</p>
            
            <p>In <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid564/">1604</ref> in <rs ref="eats:450814" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Wetherden</rs>, some twenty disguised (costumed) persons led by a carpenter
             marched up and down the streets of Wetherden for three hours, laying seige to the house
             of a tanner named <rs ref="eats:440928" type="Person_Male">Nicholas Rosyer</rs>. The objective of the <rs ref="eats:45595" type="CrimesMisdemeanors">skimmington</rs> was to mock Rosyer
             for his alleged inability to 'control' his wife, who they said had beaten him for his
             drunkedness. Their goal was to admonish the woman by shaming her (and other women) 'for
             her misdemeano{u}r toward{es} her husband.' Wearing 'base and ragged ragg{es},' they
             dressed Rosyer's male neighbour as a woman and carried him through the streets on a
             cowl staff, assaulting Rosyer's wife when she confronted them.</p>
            
            <p>On the surface this particular episode could be seen as a joke and parody that got
             out of hand. But it also illustrates an ancient custom (newly popular in the late
             sixteenth century) that used street theatre to admonish couples who failed to preserve
             patriarchal hierarchies; it did so mainly by threatening women. Its basic structure
             exemplifies the dark side of women and performance. This kind of domestic drama, as
             described in the court documents, was a form in which ‘the wife’ is the central
             character. She comes across as something approaching a wild woman with a supine and
             victimized husband. She becomes the cause of the problem in her harsh refusal to accept
             her drunken husband’s actions, thereby entering the county’s pantheon of shrews.</p>
            
            <p>The newly repressive environment in English society from the late-sixteenth through
             the mid-seventeenth centuries, driven by evangelical reformists, appears to have
             signalled the end of the acceptance of women in performance. Female performers tend to
             disappear from most performance records (excepting private household and royal
             records).</p>

           <head>Performance Venues</head>
           <p>Unfortunately, most performance records do not name the venue, but those that do so
            mention halls of many kinds (civic, guild, monastic, private residence), churches and
            churchyards, streets, castles, inns and taverns, schools, greens, and dedicated game
            places (as at Walsham and Beccles).</p>
           
           <p>Moot halls (the name given in East Anglia to the building used for a town's elections
            and other business) were the most frequently named venues. In Sudbury an order by the
            burgesses in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid537/">1607</ref> forbade further use of the moot hall for interludes and other plays
            'heretofore vsually suffred to be acted' there, 'because the hall had recently been
            repaired and 'bewtified.' Sudbury had two moot halls. The original or 'Old Moot Hall,'
            built in 1430, still stands. The 'New Moot Hall,' built in the sixteenth century but
            demolished in the nineteenth century, was the players' venue.</p>
           
           <p>The Ipswich Moot Hall (also called 'the Guild Hall’ or 'the Hall') had originally been
            the Corpus Christi guild hall. It was located on the Cornhill and was 'converted from,
            or erected immediately to the north of, the redundant medieval church of St

            unambiguously as a venue for players in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid388/">1571</ref>. However, a performance by the Queen's
            players before the master bailiff in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid389/">1572–3</ref>; by an Italian tumbler who likewise
            performed before the bailiff and his brethren in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid443/">1573–4</ref>; and by another tumbler
            performing 'at the hawll' in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid392/">1577–8</ref> all likely occurred in the Moot Hall. The Hall
            probably continued as a playing venue because in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid286/">1614</ref> the city found it necessary to
            issue an order newly forbidding any players of interludes resorting to the town to play
            in the Moot Hall, or indeed to play in the city at all. Shakespeare's company likely
            performed in the Moot Hall in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid342/">1594–5</ref>, 1603, and 1609, when they visited Ipswich.</p>
           
           <p>Whatever the case with professional troupes, the Ipswich Moot Hall served as a venue
            for local performance throughout the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. The city
            had two major civic ceremonials each year. One was 'the Guild' (the name given the
            annual feast for burgesses and their wives); the other was the celebration of the
            Queen's Coronation Day. 'The Guild' included feasting, pageants (the records sometimes
            say a single ship pageant, sometimes several pageants) and orations. The Coronation Day
            celebration, increasingly militaristic after the defeat of the Spanish Armada (civic
            accounts include payments for gunpowder, paper, and thread), included triumphs, musters,
            and pageants. While the feast, with its dining and music, obviously occurred inside the
            hall, the other events would have required outdoor staging, most logically on the
            Cornhill near the hall. Records indicate that such ceremonials utilized both scaffold
            staging and pageants. It is a pattern typical of Suffolk. Additionally, in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid420/">1624–5</ref> the
            city paid the players 'which did shew the sightes att the ffryers.' Ipswich had three
            friaries—the Caramelite, Dominican, and Franciscan, but at which of them these players
            performed is unclear.</p>
           
           <p>Visiting troupes performed in one of Sudbury's two Moot Halls. The older of them, the
            so-called Old Moot Hall, still surviving on Cross Street, dates from the fifteenth
            century. The records (being from a later era) provide no evidence that it served as a
            performance venue. The second of the two, the <rs ref="eats:366555" type="Place_F_TownHall">New Moot Hall</rs> (also known as Town Hall),
            dates from the mid-sixteenth century. Visiting troupes performed there until at least
            <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid537/">1606–7</ref>, at which point town officials forbade its further use for that purpose. This
            proper Moot Hall survived until 1841 when it was torn down and replaced with a new town
             hall.<note type="foot">Hodson, 'Old Moot Hall,' p 266.</note> It survives only in
            drawings and water colour paintings. A number of Suffolk's other urban halls served as
            entertainment venues. At Bury, people used the banquet room in the <rs ref="eats:373579" type="Place_F_GuildHall">Guildhall</rs> for bride
            ales, weddings, guild elections and feasts (with music by the waits), and in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid92/">1608</ref> a
            comedy by the scholars, with music and banqueting. The former Guildhall, which stands on
            Guildhall Street, four blocks from the abbey grounds, has a minstrel's gallery dating
            from the late fifteenth century or earlier, that overlooks the banquet room.<note
             type="foot">See Margaret Statham, ‘The Guildhall, Bury St. Edmunds,' <title>Proceedings
              of the Suffolk Institute of Archaeology</title> 31 (1970), 120–1, 130–3, 146.</note>
            In Hadleigh in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid226/">1600</ref> officials ordered that no plays or weddings could thereafter be held
            in the Guildhall without the consent of six of the chief inhabitants of the town. In
            <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid537/">1607</ref> officials in Sudbury forbade plays and interludes in the Moot Hall of that town.
            While out of period, in 1656 Beccles rented its Guildhall, receiving payment of 3s 6d
            ‘of the horse dauncers for the vse of the Guildhall and some damadge.’<note type="foot"
             >For a discussion of guild structure, properties, and practices in pre– and
             post–Reformation Beccles, see Evans, ‘Holy Ghost Gild,' pp 31–44. Evans wonders whether
             these dancers were hobby horse dancers and asks why, if they were, they would have been
             performing in Beccles during the Commonwealth (p 39). The entry could possibly refer to
             a real dancing horse (common during the period), but that seems unlikely since they
             were performing inside the Guildhall, and since there were several dancers.</note></p>
           
           <p>Halls in religious houses also served as venues. The abbey at Bury had several halls
            (the Abbot's Hall over the cellar, New Hall, Old Hall, Great Hall, Hall of Pleas, King's
            Hall, Queen’s Hall, Abbot's Palace, Prior's House, and Bradfield Hall, among
             others).<note type="foot">For excellent maps of the plan of the Abbey, including
             identification of all its structures, see Pevsner, <title>Buildings of England:
              Suffolk</title>, 2nd ed (London, 1974), pp 134–5.</note> It is difficult to know which
            of them served as venues unless a surviving account specifies it as being one (for
            example, the Prior’s House and the Hall of the Convent). Players may have performed in
            the halls of two additional religious houses. The prioress of Bungay Priory watched a
            play in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid79/">1443–4</ref>, presumably in the hall of the Benedictine Nunnery of the Blessed Virgin
            Mary and the Holy Cross in Bungay.<note type="foot">Bungay Priory was founded <hi rend="italic">c</hi>
             1160–95 and dissolved <hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1536. At the time of its dissolution it had a prioress

           <p>Churches and churchyards also sometimes served as playing spaces. Bungay held an
            interlude, with a scaffold stage, in the churchyard in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid136/">1565–6</ref>. Mildenhall collected
            profits and gifts from a <rs ref="eats:431506" type="Drama_TitledWork">play of St Thomas</rs> staged on <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid171/">St Thomas Day</ref> in the Hall Yard,
            which was 'part of the manorial complex which lay beyond the church.'<note type="foot"
             >Judith Middleton-Stewart (ed), <title>Records of the Churchwardens of Mildenhall:
              Collections (1446 – 1454) and Accounts (1503 – 1553)</title>, Suffolk Record Society
             54 (Woodbridge, 2011), 44, n 16.</note> In <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid169/">1556–7</ref> Long Melford produced a game and paid
            to place thirteen seats in the churchyard (likely for the worthies). In <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid224/">1597</ref> Hadleigh
            planned to stage plays at Whitsuntide, thereby 'to draw a Concourse of people out of the
            Country,' but the privy council ordered them to desist and to 'pluck down' the stage
            that they had prepared. Given the content and the size of the intended audience, the
            venue was more likely the churchyard. In <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid235/">1482</ref> Sir John Howard, of Stoke-by-Nayland, gave
            10s 'to the cherche on Whitson Monday at the pley.' The awkward phrasing makes it
            unclear whether the play was staged in the church or not.</p>
           
           <p>Private houses were important staging venues in Suffolk for entertainers of every
            kind. Among the halls for which we have performance records are Brome Hall; Flixton
            Hall; Hengrave Hall; Little Saxham Hall; ‘the King’s House’ at Ipswich; Polstead Hall;
            Tendring Hall at Stoke-by-Nayland, and Wingfield Hall. Brome Hall, which had fallen into
            dereliction, was demolished in 1958. Flixton Hall was demolished in 1952. Of Hawstead
            Hall, situated four miles from the centre of Bury St Edmunds, only fragments remain.
            Originally a fortified manor house, it was abandoned <hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1615. Hengrave Hall,
            three miles from Bury St Edmunds, survives as a privately owned house now used for
            wedding receptions and similar functions.<note type="foot">One can request private
             viewing of the house. Its current owner, David Harris, is said to have plans to turn
             Hengrave Hall into private housing.</note> The site of ‘the King’s House’ in Ipswich is
            unknown. Little Saxham Hall, a fortified hall with a gatehouse and drawbridge, was built
            in 1516 and pulled down in 1771–3. Nothing but foundations and moats remain. Long
            Melford Hall, built in the sixteenth century, is an excellent example of a turreted
            manor house. It incorporates part of an earlier manor house. The medieval Polstead Hall
            was replaced by a sixteenth century house that was itself modernized in the eighteenth
            century. The present Polstead Hall, located west of the parish church of St Mary, is a
            timber-framed structure dating from the sixteenth century. No evidence of a
            fourteenth-century hall is mentioned in available sources.<note type="foot">Polstead
             Manor dates from the twelfth century. When the lord of the manor, Thomas de Lambourne,
             died in 1361, followed by the death of his son and heir William in the following year,
             the manor passed to Thomas's sister, the wife of William de Cheyne (or Chene)
             (1334–75). The lordship passed to his son, Roger de Cheyne (1362–1414), who would have
             been lord at the time of the summer game in 1381. The family held Polstead Manor for
             life on behalf of the king, however, the <title>HPO</title> observes that there is no
             evidence that Roger de Cheyne actually took possession of Polstead Manor ('Cheyne,
             Roger (1362–1414), of Drayton Beauchamp, Bucks,'
             <ref target="http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1386-1421/member/cheyne-roger-1362-1414">http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1386-1421/member/cheyne-roger-1362-1414</ref>), which may, in part, explain why Atteforth was so bold as to stage his uninvited summer
             game in its hall; the manor may have been uninhabited at the time. Polstead Hall survives as a Grade II Listed building in Polstead. Wingfield Hall was a manor house built within the walls of Wingfield Castle.
             The castle survives as a private dwelling, but the hall no longer exists, having been
             replaced with modern dwellings. Tendring Hall was demolished (apparently for no good
             reason) in 1955. See Christopher Dyer, ‘The Rising of 1381 in Suffolk: Its Origins and
             Participants,’ <title>Publications of the Suffolk Institute for Archaeology</title> 36.4
             (1988), p 281; Pevsner, <title>Suffolk</title>, pp 395-6; and Birch, <title>Ancient
              Sites</title>, pp 300–1, and 355 (Tendring Hall).</note> The medieval Tendring Hall in Stoke-by-Nayland was the
            residence of John, Lord Howard (<hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1420-2–85), later named duke of Norfolk. All
            that remains of the original Tendring Hall is chimney stacks to the rear of
             stables.<note type="foot">In 1522, Thomas Howard, Earl of Surrey was living at Tendring
             Hall, so it survived at that point. The date of its destruction is not given in the
             records, but eventually a new Tendring Hall was built in 1784, but demolished in 1955,
             See Birch, <title>Ancient Sites</title>, p 355.</note> Of the original interior
            buildings of Wingfield Castle (including Wingfield Hall) nothing remains.</p>
           
           <p>In <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid138/">1567–8</ref> the parish of Bungay staged a game in the castle yard of the twelfth-century
            Norman castle at Bungay, where the wives of the town collected 57s 8d among the booths
            and 'ells' at the game site.</p>
           
           <p>Places of commercial hospitality must have been venues too because two towns felt it
            necessary to prohibit their use by performers. In <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid83/">1607</ref> the aldermen of Bury ordered that
            ‘noe Inholder Alehowskeep{er} [or] victualler’ permit stage plays, comedies, interludes,
            or sights involving horses, baboons, apes, bears, and puppets, or other shows in those
            three venues.</p>
           
           <p>Streets were no less important for processions of all kinds. Corpus Christi pageants
            at Bungay, Bury, and Ipswich obviously moved through the streets. The musters, triumphs
            and public speeches on Coronation Day in Dunwich and Ipswich certainly happened in the
            streets. A strange and ancient fertility ceremony for women in Bury, called <ref target="https://ereed.org/collections/suffk/appendix-2/">The Ceremony
            of the White Bull</ref>, involved a procession with the white bull, a supplicant woman (from
            the nobility), members of the clergy, and a crowd, made its way through Churchgate,
            Guildhall, and Abbeygate Streets to the Great West Gate of the Abbey, culminating in a
            religious service within the Abbey.<note type="foot">Bury also used the bullring, in the
             street, as a place for the punishment of felons needing to be flogged. </note> The tiny
            village of Weybread had a 'merriment' upon the town close in 1617.</p>
           
           <p>Some evidence indicates that dedicated outdoor sites served as venues. At a corner of
            its camping close, Walsham le Willows had an outdoor playing space used to stage plays
            which local records called a game place. It was a ‘fayre round place of earth ... a
            half-acre in size,’ across the street, diagonally, from the parish church of St Mary.
            Walsham’s is one of two places in the county designated as game places (the other being
             Beccles).<note type="foot">References to the Beccles Game Place occur in a number of
             documents in the Beccles collection now at Suffolk Archives in Ipswich. See Charity
             Trust Deed, 994/A/1/2 (reference to game place in deed, 1599); Statement of Bargain and
             Sale, 994/B/1/2 (John Mason’s sale of the property containing the game place to the

            communities had dedicated outdoor recreational sites, many with names similar to game
            place (for example, ‘Le Playing Place,’ or ‘The Little Playing Close’), but there is no
            record that plays were staged there.</p>

           <head>Animal Entertainment</head>
           <p><rs ref="eats:21767" type="Entertainment_AnimalSport">Bearbaiting</rs> is the only animal 'entertainment' that appears in the Suffolk records.
            Bearwards turn up in the records of private households, religious houses and towns.
            Several patterns emerge. Most (but not all) of the bearwards were itinerants with noble
            patrons. Keeping bears was expensive and labor-intensive; it was generally a patronage
            for the rich. Both single bearwards who had one or more bears, and bearwards performing
            together appear in town and household accounts. The many payments to bearwards in the
            Ipswich civic records show variety in the bearwards’ approach to travel and performance.
            Bearwards might mount spectacles alone or with other bearwards. Patron lords might have
            a single bearward or several in their employ. While payments by the town were almost
            always given to one individual bearward, he might, in fact, have had servants whom he,
            in turn, maintained. For examples of the variety in itinerant bearwarding as a form, see
            entries from the Ipswich civic records in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid392/">1577–8</ref>, <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid423/">1584–5</ref>,

           <p>The only payments to bearwards by a Suffolk religious house occur at Mettingham
            College between 1470 and 1479. The records of three private households include payments
            to bearwards: Howard in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid240/">1462</ref> and <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid246/">1464</ref> (to his own bearward); the duke of Suffolk’s
            bearwards in 1514–15 and 1527–8 (payments by Thetford Priory near the Norfolk-Suffolk
            border); and the Kitsons in 1541.<note type="foot">Cambridge, CUL: Add. MSS 6969, ff 119
             and 205v.</note></p>
           
           <p>Of Suffolk towns, bearwards received recorded payments in Aldeburgh and Ipswich. The
            Aldeburgh burgesses paid the bearward of the duke of Norfolk in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid22/">1566–7</ref> and <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid23/">1567–8</ref>. The
            fact that the duke's bearward also appeared in Ipswich during those years provides the
            only evidence in the Suffolk records of a possible itnerary. Ipswich has by far the
            greatest number of payments to bearwards. The first of them, in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid326/">1530–1</ref>, went to to the
            <rs ref="eats:166270" type="Collective_Troupe">bearwards of the king</rs> and the <rs ref="eats:167499" type="Collective_Troupe">'French Queen'</rs> (Mary, duchess of Suffolk, daughter of
            Henry VIII and wife of Charles Brandon). The rest of the payments to bearwards in
            Ipswich—some twenty-six in all—occur between 1562–3 and 1619–20. The greatest number
            went to the queen's bearward (six times); the <rs ref="eats:366637" type="Person_Male">duke of Norfolk's</rs> and <rs ref="eats:408416" type="Collective_Troupe">Lord Monteagle's</rs>
            (three each); the King's (two); and the <rs ref="eats:411092" type="Collective_Troupe">Lords Berkeley</rs>, <rs ref="eats:175656" type="Collective_Troupe">Cheney</rs>, <rs ref="eats:414563" type="Collective_Troupe">Sheffield</rs>, and <rs ref="eats:410990" type="Collective_Troupe">Vesey</rs>,
            and Sir Francis Hindes (one each). Four other bearwards had no named patron and appear
            to have been loners.</p>
           
           <p>Some entries indicate that the bearward who was being paid had more than one bear. In
            <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid439/">1568–9</ref>, for example, the duke of Norfolk's bearward was paid for baiting his bears uppon
            the Corn Hill in the centre of Ipswich. Other entries indicate that a lord had more than
            one bearward, as in payments to Lord Vesey's bearwards in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid393/">1578–9</ref>, Lord Berkeley's in
            <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid451/">1581–2</ref>, and Lord Sheffield's in <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid401/">1591–2</ref>. Whether such entries are referring to a bearward
            and his assistants or to several bearwards working together is unclear.</p>
           
           <p>Such events must have been considerable spectacles. Payments to the bearwards range
            from 6s 8d to 10s, comparable to the amounts given important troupes of actors.</p>
           
           <p>Bull baiting, while considered an entertaining diversion by spectators through the
            early nineteenth century, was apparently more of a tedious statutory regulation to many
            butchers (baiting was thought to tenderize the meat). In nearly every year Ipswich civic
            officials collected many fines from butchers who had failed to bait their bulls before
            slaughtering them. The city even hired a man to detect unbaited bulls and report the
            offending butcher.<note type="foot">Ipswich, Suffolk Archives: Ipswich Audited Accounts,
             C/3/3/2/17, f [3].</note> Apparently butchers were content to pay fines rather than
            organize a baiting. Some baitings certainly did occur; civic account record payments to
            repair the rope and collar for the bulls but the accounts include no payments for the
            baitings themselves.</p>

      <p> This folio of the account includes receipts of 41s 1d from a church ale, plus 22s 1d from
       a gathering made at the same ale by the the 'bachelors' (so identified in the subsequent
       entry), and a further 35s by the same bachelors. The bachelors routinely conducted gatherings
       on Plough Monday but the entry does not identify the ale in these entries as having occurred
       on Plough Monday, nor do the entries refer to mimetic activities (as would have occurred, for
       example, at a Whitsun Ale).</p>

      <p> Folio 36v is headed 'A<ex>nn</ex>o d<ex>omi</ex>ni 1555' but no day/month range is
       specified. The sum at the foot of the previous folio is for 'one hole yere endyed at Ianuarye
        A<ex>nn</ex>o D<ex>omi</ex>ni 1554.' </p>

      <p> Folio 39 is headed 'A<ex>nn</ex>o d<ex>omi</ex>ni 1556,' and f 40v 'A<ex>nn</ex>o
        d<ex>omi</ex>ni 1557, both with no day/month range specified.</p>

      <p> '[M]alet' (f 39) in this instance may mean 'malt' because on f 46, the miller of Hall Mill
       was paid for the grinding of two seams (sixteen bushels) of malt for the church ale. A seam
       equals two coombes. A coombe of grain equals four bushels. Therefore the parish bought two
       bushels. The purchase of malt against the gaming seemingly indicates that the play or game
       was mounted in conjunction with, or as part of, a church ale.</p>

      <p> It was apparently the practice in Long Melford to send a single person to proclaim its
       game (and a different person for each place), rather than sending a troupe to cry the bans.

      <p> The account is chronologically arranged, and the entry for the schoolmaster's play comes
       between midsummer and 2 October. An elementary school was present in Long Melford before
       1484, and in 1548 a deed refers to <rs ref="eats:469229" type="Person_Male">Sir Edward
        Tyrell</rs>, a stipendiary priest of Long Melford as aiding the curate and teaching a
       grammar school at Long Melford (<title>VCH: Suffolk</title>, vol 2, p 340). The records do
       not indicate the venue at which the schoolmaster's play was performed.</p>

      <p> The Long Melford churchwardens' accounts between 1573 and 1641 (FL 509/5/1) contain many
       payments to a widow known as 'waytes wyfe' or 'wedow wayte' (ff [1, 3v, 4, and ff]) and to
       another woman for keeping the deceased man's children (f [1v]). Whether he had been a
       musician is unclear from the records, but his family required poor relief from the parish.
       Typical is the entry 'payd to waites wyfe vj d.' (f [3v]). </p>

      <p> The penultimate entry on f 12 (occuring two entries after the payment to the piper) refers
       to a meeting that was planned to occur on 15 August, indicating, as do several references to
       the payment of quarterly wages, that the payments on this folio were all made in August.</p>

      <p> Browne the minstrel is one of several persons, including the priest, who were paid for
       contributing to the refurbishing of the clock. </p>

      <p> A partial picture of John Browne can be pieced together from the several entries that
       mention him. In 1567–8 he is identified as a minstrel and in 1573–4 as a wait. He is paid in
       1573–4 and 1574–5 for having a blind boy in his care, probably a poor boy taken as as an
       apprentice musician, since later records (see below) show that to have been the practice in
       Aldeburgh. These payments for wood at the church and for whiting the church, show him to have
       been employed, at least intermittently, by the parish. It is impossible to know whether the
       reference to stages indicates carpenter's scaffolding or stages for playing, but the Queen's
       Men did play in Aldeburgh that year. Someone named Brown, presumably this person, was dead in
       1573–4 (f 78v) and a different person (John Batche) then took responsibility for the
       clock.</p>

       shillings for 2 cades of spratt (smelt) (f 80). Fishing was the town's principal commercial
       activity. In the same year the town paid Mr Periman for his dinner while travelling about the
       town's business (f 80). Of particular relevance to this collection, in 1584-5 Mr Periman paid

      <p> The entries on ff 103v and 106, as well as the one for 1573–4, seem to indicate that Blind
       Harry lived in the care of the wait, Thomas Brown, but was apprenticed to another musician,
       Peter Hunt, or that for some other reason he was shuttled back and forth between the two
       musicians during these years.</p>

      <p> In the general receipts section on f 121, the words 'Blind Harrie' are written large in
       the left margin, but the reason why is unclear.</p>

      <p> Because of a payment six entries later that was made on Coronation Day (17 November), the

       even on Coronation Day.</p>

      <p> Entries for the devil's coat on f 182 occur between entries dated (respectively) 6 October
       and 20 October. Winn, <title>Records</title>, p 11, dates the entries related to the devil's
       coat as occurring in 1581, but they occurred in 1582-3. The bailiff's payment to 'the
       Players' on 3 August, and payments for gear related to the devil, suggest that these were
       local players likely performing a <rs ref="eats:129826" type="Drama_Type">morality
       play</rs>.</p>

      <p> The payment on f 183 is preceded, two entries earlier, by a payment made on the Sunday
       before <rs ref="eats:239365" type="CalendarDay_Liturgical">Christmas</rs> 1583, thus this
       payment was likely made for a play on or near Christmas. </p>

       It is usually positioned near the Plough Monday receipts, but is always distinct from them,
       and the hocpot amounts always far exceed those from ales or Plough Monday gatherings. It
       seems likely that the hocpot refers to the kind of gathering activity traditionally held at
       Hocktide (on the Monday and/or Tuesday after Easter, thus between 31 March and 4 May). It
       might be a one or a two-day event. If the latter, men imprisoned (or bound) women on Monday
       (or confiscated their shoes) until the women paid release money. Women similarly captured the
       men on Tuesdays. The money raised by the women always far exceeded that raised by the
       men.</p>

      <p> In Boxford the event involved the contribution of a considerable amount of grain used for
       brewing. Traditionally the event was inherently mimetic in that its premises and actions
       involved comic combat or ambush (the capturing and ransoming) as in <rs ref="eats:35310"
        type="Entertainment_FolkCustom">Robin Hood games</rs>. At Kenilworth Castle in 1575, for
       Elizabeth's entertainment, 'Coventre men <gap reason="omitted"/> acted the ancient play, long
       since used in the city, called Hocks Tuesday,' a combat and victory play (W. Carew Hazlitt,
        <title>Faiths and Folklore of the British Isles</title>, 2 vols (London, 1813), 318). But
       what Hocktide precisely may have involved in Boxford the records do not say (on Hocktide, see
       Hazlitt, <title>Faiths and Folklore</title>; Steve Roud, <title>The English Year</title>
       (London, 2006), 316–18; and J. Charles Cox, <title>The Sports and Pastimes of the Peoples of
        England By Joseph Strutt</title> (Detroit, 1968), pp 274–50.)</p>

      <p> The payment on p 6 to Stoke play appears to be made to banns cryers for a play that would
       be staged in Stoke-by-Nayland (see also the entries from pp 8, 21, and 30). In 1466 Sir John
       Howard had paid the <rs ref="eats:8782" type="Entertainer_Type">players</rs> of Stoke 6s 8d
       for a performance on the Sunday next after Twelfth Day of that year (12 January), indicating
       that the local playing tradition in Stoke was current over at least a sixty-year period. </p>

     <div type="endnote">
      <p> Given that the case was heard at the beginning of 1606, and that the defendant says the
       raid had taken place about four years earlier, the incident likely occurred during harvest
       time in 1601.</p>

      <p> These examination answers given by Leese are responding to questions or interrogatories
       put to the defendant Leese by the court on behalf of the accusers or plaintiffs in the case.
       Responses by his fellow defendant, Ezekiel Cooke, to the same questions, if he, in fact, was
       required to give them, do not survive. In essence, Interrogatory 1 asks whether Leese and
       Cooke knew the other defendants. Interrogatory 2 asks whether other of the defendants had
       asked Leese and Cooke to journey with them from Colchester into Bramford, and had paid them
       to do so. Interrogatory 3 asks whether Leese and Cooke had carried weapons, whether they had
       been provided with food or lodgings by other of the defendants, and whether they were aware
       of defendants other than themselves being similarly paid by certain of the defendants.
       Interrogatories 4-6 (not represented by answers here) ask whether Leese, Cooke, and others
       were fed, paid, lodged, and supplied by Francis Colborne, gentleman, and others. The several
       questions in this interrogatory reflect the charges that the defendants went at night to
       sheare and cut down wheat or corn, put it into a cart, and carry it away, all from a close
       claimed by the plaintiff, Henry Dey of Bramford, and that they had violently resisted a
       justice of the peace when he came to stop them. </p>

      <p> In this account, the wardens paid 4d for sewing of the banner cloth (for use in
       processions). It is not possible to connect the game to fund-raising with certainty in that
       it is not ever mentioned among the receipts.</p>

      <p> In <title>The Medieval Stage</title>, p 343, E.K. Chambers says that a Norwich priest, one
        <rs ref="eats:403398" type="Person_Male">Stephen Prewett</rs>, was paid for his labour 'in
       the matter,' meaning the matter of copying the game book, but the payment to the priest
       occurs much later on the page and it says not 'in the matter' but '&amp; costes.' The nature
       of the priest's labours is unclear. Also, the original account identifies him not as 'Stephen
       Prewett' but as 'Ser prewett.' </p>

      <p> Robert Seyman, in his own confession (see <ptr target="#suffk-rid72"/>) said that he lived
       at Wutton, which is very likely the village of Woodton, Norfolk, situated about four miles
       from Bungay, Suffolk where the play was staged. Seyman said that Turner, the person he had
       whooped ('whoppid') to, was his neighbour, thus Tyndall Wood is most probably Tyndall Wood,
       Ditchingham. The village of Ditchingham is located on the Norfolk side of The River Waveney,
       two miles north of Bungay. </p>

      <p> The Wutton where Seyman lived is very likely the village of Woodton, Norfolk, situated
       about four miles from Bungay, Suffolk where the <rs ref="eats:35779"
        type="Entertainment_FolkCustom">play</rs> was staged. Seyman said that Turner, the person he
       had whooped ('whoppid') to, was his neighbour, thus Tyndall Wood is most probably Tyndall
       Wood, Ditchingham. The village of Ditchingham is located on the Norfolk side of The River
       Waveney, two miles north of Bungay. </p>

      <p> The ale and game on Trinity Sunday (p 27) confirm sometime connections between the games
       and the church ales, especially on Trinity Sunday.</p>

      <p> In the margin of p 33 someone has drawn a pointing finger and reference to the building of
       the scaffold for the interlude in a modern hand.</p>

      <p> Thomas Howard (p 34; 1537/8–72) was ninth duke of Norfolk and fifteenth earl of Surrey
       from 25 August 1554, with residences at Charterhouse, Middlesex, Kenninghall, Norfolk, and
       Duke's Palace, Norwich; he was executed for treason. See <ref
        target="https://library2.utm.utoronto.ca/otra/reed/node/316135"
       ><title>P&amp;P</title></ref>. </p>

      <p> In the margins of pp 33–5, someone has rendered sums, details, and parts of the original
       marginalia in a modern hand, repeating in abbreviated form the essence of what is on the
       page.</p>

      <p> The play (p 35) was staged on Trinity Sunday, 9 June, 1566 and either Saturday, 8 June or
       Monday, 10 June, likely the former if the wish was to have the culminating episodes of the
       play occur on a Sunday. </p>

      <p> Castle Yard (p 46) refers to a space within what remains of the <hi rend="italic">c</hi>
       twelfth-century castle built by Baron Roger Bigod in the center of Bungay, looking down on
       the River Waveney at a large bend in the river. The Castle Yard, also known as the Outer
       Bailey, is 'set out along the southern side of the original castle, approximately two hundred
       feet away from the edges of the ditches' of the castle (Hugh Braun, <title>Bungay Castle:
        Report on the Excavations</title> 22, Part 2 (1935), 4). Ownership of the castle descended
       through the Uffords to the Howards, who gave it to the town of Bungay in 1987. It is now
       owned by the Bungay Castle Trust (Birch, <title>Ancient Sites: Historic Places</title>, p
       61). </p>

      <p> John Underwood was a churchwarden in 1566. Nine of the ten men named here can be
       identified as having served as churchwardens one or more times. The practice seems to have
       been that men and women shared joint responsibility for the safety and the presenting of
       money taken in from the game. This shared husband-wife responsibility by wardens and their
       wives indicates a major role for churchwardens in the production of fund-raising religious
       drama in Bungay. </p>

      <p>One wonders if the Henry Buckenham who supplied planks for the cloud in this play was the
       Henry Buckenham (or a relative) who would supply cloth for the waits' livery coats in Ipswich
       in 1608 (SRO Ipswich: C/3/2/1/2, f 162), and again in 1619-20? </p>

      <p> In the margins, the game in the castle yard is noted in a later hand. </p>

      <p> It is uncertain from the records whether these entries are references to a stage for
       plays, or to a strictly religious display of some kind, but payments in past years for the
       scaffold for the interlude, and a reference to nails for a scaffold that was clearly for
       entertainments in 1566–7, support the impression that these entries are for a play stage, as

        Edmund have petitioned us that since they had granted sustenance for him, our beloved
        minstrel, John Manpryne, for himself, one attendant, and one horse, for the whole life of
        the same John in the aforesaid abbey, subject to a fixed procedure to be taken at our
        request, and (since) we wish to provide favourably for the indemnity of the same abbot and
        monastery lest they or their successors be burdened hereafter by (the provision of)
        sustenance of this kind after the death of the aforesaid John by reason of the aforesaid
        grant made to us, as is already mentioned, or it be otherwise prejudicial for them on that
        occasion, we, not wishing that those things which the same abbot and monastery have granted
        to the same John freely from the pure will of the same in this matter, at our earnest
        request, should fall to them or their successors or the aforesaid abbot in future times in
        prejudice or loss but wishing rather to provide as we are obliged for their security, wish
        and grant, for us and our heirs that the grant of the said abbot and monastery of the
        aforesaid sustenance now made at our request from the pure will of the same shall not fall
        to the same abbot and monastery or their successors in prejudice or be drawn in consequence
        into the future nor that the same abbot and monastery and their successors be burdened in
        any way regarding any provision or sustenance to be granted at our entreaties or requests or
        (those) of our heirs after the death of the aforesaid John, by reason of the aforesaid
        grant, but that they themselves from the provision and sustenance of this kind after the
        death of the aforesaid John be exonerated entirely and <damage><gap unit="chars" extent="3"

        the chancery of the lord king <damage><gap unit="chars" extent="2"/></damage> by John

        according to the form of the proclamation made thereof by royal writ in the form written
        below.</ab>

       <ab>There is, moreover, a certain guild in the church of Bury St Edmund which from time
        immemorial out of <damage><gap unit="chars" extent="3"/></damage> of the people of the
        aforesaid town was established and founded to the honour of Corpus Christi and is still
        continued under this rule, namely, that the brothers and sisters of the aforesaid guild will
        gather on Corpus Christi day and they will hold mass of the day and each of them will offer
        one farthing and they procure wax candles specific to the honour of Corpus Christi which
        burn on all the feast days throughout the year in the aforesaid church and a certain
        chaplain who celebrates divine service for the aforesaid brothers and sisters, and they will
        have on the same day matching hoods and a certain interlude of Corpus Christi. Indeed,the
        said brothers and sisters, when they are made and appointeded anew, are obliged by a sworn
        bond to maintain and sustain that interlude. And on the same day at their own cost they will
        eat together at a certain place in the aforesaid town. The said brothers and sisters,
        moreover, will be present for exequies and other solemnities on the day of the death of (one
        of the) brothers and sisters of the aforesaid guild, they will offer for the mass one
        farthing and they will give one penny for the celebration of the mass on the same day for
        his or her soul. And moreover, on the said day they will elect one alderman who will have
        the care and oversight of the aforesaid guild for the following year. And there are not
        there more goods or chatels or lands, tenements, rents, or possessions, amortized or not
        amortized, pertaining to the said fraternity other than as has been expressed above.</ab>

      <p> In addition to this entry, John Green, musician, was also paid 10s for performing at the
       civic feast on 16 January 1619/20 and 10s again for a similar performance on 2 January
       1621/2. He appears to have been one of the town's waits, perhaps their master. He died in
       late December 1621 and was buried at St James Church (Stratham, <title>Accounts</title>, p
       355). His contribution of music to the comedy confirms that Bury's waits sometimes
       contributed to local dramatic productions</p>

      <p> John Dickinson (d. 1643) was high master of <rs ref="eats:373556" type="Place_F_School"
        >Bury Grammar School</rs> from 1605 through 1637. He had been recommended to that position
       by Sir Edward Coke, lord chief justice of England, whose student Dickinson had been at
       Cambridge. Dickinson received a lifetime appointment, and the school was said to have thrived
       under his leadership. When he resigned from the school for a time in 1618, due to ill health,
       the governors of the school awarded him £5 a year to help him in seeking treatment and a
       perpetual annuity of £20 (R.W. Elliott, <title>The Story of King Edward VI School</title>
       (Bury, 1963), 52-9).</p>

      <p> One of Dickinson's scholars was paid for making an <rs ref="eats:41951"
        type="Entertainment_Type">oration</rs> to the governors of the school in 1607 (item [6], mb
       [2]),and others of the 'Grammer Schollers' were twice paid by the governors for performing
       their verses in 1609 (item [4], mb [1]). The payments suggest that he was teaching them a
       range of performative skills. </p>

      <p> The guildhall, which dates from the thirteenth century (or earlier), is located on
       Guildhall Street, four blocks from the abbey grounds. The medieval hall has been divided into
       a north hall, ‘known as the Sessions or Court Room, from the Borough Sessions having formerly
       been held there,’ or Sessions Room, and a south hall or Banqueting Room. It is in the latter,
       according to Tymms, that weddings and bride-ales were held during Jacobean and Caroline
       times, which generated considerable revenue for the town. In earlier centuries (including our
       period), townsmen used the guildhall as a town hall. At least four of Bury's religious guilds
       (Assumption, Purification, <rs ref="eats:371701" type="Collective_GuildsReligious"
        >Candlemas</rs>, and St Peter) held their guild meetings there (Samuel Tymms, <title>A
        Handbook of Bury St. Edmunds in the County of Suffolk</title> (Bury St Edmunds, 1854), 47–8;
       for a detailed study of the guildhall, see Statham, 'Guildhall,' pp 117–57). Although still a
       monastic borough in the fifteenth century, Bury was an important wool-producing town and its
       population grew considerably. During that century, local worthies rebuilt and improved parts
       of the guildhall, including the roof, porch, and kitchen (Statham, 'Guildhall, p 120). A
       minstrels' gallery rests above the entrance vestibule, looking down on the banqueting room
       (Statham, 'Guildhall,' p 130; figs 22, 23). For more on the guildhall, see Statham,
        <title>Accounts </title>, pp xiii, lii, lvi–lvii, and lix (on wedding parties). </p>

      <p> Thomas Stephens was high master of Bury Grammar School, 1638–45, and again between 1647
       and 1663. He was an ardent royalist, which might account for his absence from the school
       between 1645 and 1647. During his two-year hiatus, he taught his own school at a location
       which is unknown. While Stephens was gone, the governors felt that Bury Grammar School had
       fallen into decline and in 1647 they prevailed upon him to return to 'replenyshe' the school.
       He was held in such esteem that the governors had purchased a house for his use in 1639, and
       in 1654 they permitted him to purchase it (which he had no financial difficulty in doing). It
       is also obvious from the school accounts that he was skilled in the production of plays by
       his scholars (Elliott, <title>Story</title>, pp 59–61). </p>
      <p> The nine men who signed the order on 1 October and again on 16 December 1639 were the
       governors of Bury Grammar School. Two of the governors who signed on 1 October (John Godbold
       and William Colman) had been replaced (by Jasper Sharpe and Henry Walker) in the order of 16
       December. Four of the governors were also officers of the town. John Godbold was recorder;
       John Woodward was clerk to the feoffees of the town lands; Robert Browne was an alderman,
       feoffee, and receiver; and Anthoney Smyth was an alderman and feoffee (Statham,
        <title>Accounts</title>, pp xx-xxi (n 48), xxv-xxvii, liv, xliv, 194, 263, 247, 270, 274,
       289 (n 12), 309, 314, 321, 359). Henry Chapman was a grocer (Tymm, <title>Wills and
        Inventories </title>, p 220). It has not been possible to identify with certainty the
       remaining governors, although men of the same names who died in the 1670s are identified in
       indexes of Bury and Sudbury wills as gentlemen. </p>
      <p>Simonds D’Ewes (1602-1650), was knighted by Charles I on 6 December 1626, was high sheriff
       of Suffolk in 1639, and became MP for Sudbury in 1640. Although he was an influential
       antiquary and politician in London, he retired to Stowlangtoft Hall near Bury St Edmunds in
       1632. In his youth, he had been a student at Bury grammar school, where he had distinguished
       himself in his facility with authoring great numbers of Greek and Latin verses (J.M.
       Blatchly, 'D'Ewes, Sir Simonds, First Baronet (1602-1650, Diarist and Antiquary,'

      <p> Thomas Stephens was high master of Bury Grammar School, 1638–45, and again between 1647
       and 1663. He was an ardent royalist, which might account for his absence from the school
       between 1645 and 1647. During his two-year hiatus, he taught his own school at a location
       which is unknown. While Stephens was gone, the governors felt that Bury Grammar School had
       fallen into decline and in 1647 they prevailed upon him to return to 'replenyshe' the school.
       He was held in such esteem that the governors had purchased a house for his use in 1639, and
       in 1654 they permitted him to purchase it (which he had no financial difficulty in doing). It
       is also obvious from the school accounts that he was skilled in the production of plays by
       his scholars (Elliott, <title>Story</title>, pp 59–61). </p>

       Entering the abbey precinct through the Great Gate brings one immediately into a large open

       Kitchen, and then a second hall called the Queen's Chamber' (<title>Suffolk</title>, p 137).

      <p>This record is the earliest mention of the ceremony of the boy bishop in the records of the
       abbey. For a discussion of the institution of the boy bishop, and of uniquely surviving coins
       or tokens possibly used in the ceremony of the boy bishop at Bury St Edmunds see J.B.
       Caldecott, 'The Money of the Boy Bishop at Bury St. Edmunds,' <title>Transactions of the
        International Numismatic Congress: Organized and Held in London by the Royal Numismatic
        Society, June 30–July 3, 1936, on the Occasion of its Centenary</title>, J. Allen <hi
        rend="italic">et al</hi> (eds) (London, 1938), 366–71. While acknowledging that the certain
       connection of the tokens to the boy bishop cannot be proved, Caldecott makes a compelling
       argument that the tokens were moulded at Bury, had a redeemable value, and were distributed
       as alms to the poor by the boy bishop during his Christmas season ministry (Caldecott,
       'Money,' p 92). See also S. E. Rigold, ‘The St. Nicholas or ‘Boy Bishop’ Tokens,’
        <title>Proceedings of the Suffolk Institute of Archaeology and History</title>, 34 (1977),
       87-101. Though his study of the tokens is archaeological in focus, Rigold accepts that the
       English version has certain qualities that justify associating surviving tokens with the
       ceremony of the boy bishop (pp 90-1), although the precise relationshop of the tokens to the
       ceremony itself, in his view, ‘is not yet clear’ (p 91). Rigold also provides persuasive
       contextual evidence associating the tokens with the Abbey of Bury St Edmunds and the
       confraternity of St Nicholas in St Mary parish church in Bury (p 92). See also <title>VCH:
        Suffolk</title>, vol 2, p 312. </p>

      <p> Henry Tudor (1491–1546/7) was Henry VIII of England from 22 April 1509. See <ref

       ><title>P&amp;P</title></ref>.</p>
      <p> Sir Robert Curson (1460-1534/5) was knighted in 1489, and named Baron of the Holy Roman
       Empire sometime after 1500, with residence in Ipswich. For useful biographical information on
       Curzon, see John Blatchly and Bill Haward, ‘Sir Robert, Lord Curson, Soldier, Courtier and
       Spy, and His Ipswich Mansion,’ <title>Suffolk Institute of Archaeology and Natural
        History</title> 41.3 (2007), 335-50.</p>

      <p> Katherine of Aragon (1485-1536) was queen of England from 1509 to 1533. She served
       impressively as regent of the kingdom in 1513 while her husband was in France, which may
       explain the use of the term <hi rend="italic">princeps</hi> (in this instance ‘the lady
       sovereign’). It appears that he was permitting that same title for Katherine in 1520 (given
       the honorific used by the scribe at Bury), a year filled with momentous international
       diplomatic events in which she played a central part (C.S.L. Davies and John Edwards,
       'Katherine [Catalina, Catherine, Katherine of Aragon] (1485-1536),' <title>ODNB</title>,

      <p> The payments on f [10] occurred at Kenninghall, Norfolk. </p>

      <p> Margaret Bourchier (Donington) (f [10]; <hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1510–1561) was countess
       of Bath and wife of Sir Thomas Kitson (1485–1540), with a residence at Hengrave Hall,
       Suffolk. </p>

      <p> Thomas Howard (1537/8–1572) was ninth duke of Norfolk and fifteenth earl of Surrey from 25
       August 1554, with residences at Charterhouse, Middlesex and Kenninghall, Norfolk. He was
       executed for treason in 1571/2. </p>

      <p>Lady Elizabeth Kitson Cornwallis (1546/7–1628) was the wife of Sir Thomas Kitson
       (1540–1603), with a residence at Hengrave Hall, Suffolk. </p>

      <p> Kenninghall Palace was the chief residence of the Howards, dukes of Norfolk. Built between
       1505 and 1525 for Thomas Howard, eighth duke of Norfolk (1473–1554), the main house was
       demolished <hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1650. A fragment of the service wing alone survives. </p>

      <p> The performances recorded on ff 11v and 15 occurred at <rs ref="eats:373613"
        type="Place_PA_Settlement">Brome</rs>, which is located two miles north of Eye, in Suffolk.
       The Cornwallis family lived at the <rs ref="eats:373636" type="Place_F_Residence">Brome
        estate</rs> from the late fourteenth century until 1823, when it was sold to the Kerrison
       family. Brome Hall, the Cornwallis residence, was built <hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1550 by Sir
       Thomas Cornwallis and seems likely to have been the venue at which these entertainers
       performed. A description written in 1809 says of the great hall or dining room that it
       'exhibits a perfect specimen of old English grandeur. It is very lofty, wainscoted with oak,
       to the height of about 10 feet, without ceiling; the timbers of the roof being finished like
       those of churches.' It further says that over the entrance to the room, above the butler's
       pantry, was a gallery with a flight of stairs at each end' (A. Rosamund Bateman-Hanbury,
       'Brome Hall,' <title>Proceedings of the Suffolk Institute of Archaeology</title> 14, pt 2
       (1912), 233–4. One wonders if the so-called <title>Brome Abraham and Isaac</title> play may
       have been performed there. The house was still occupied by the Kerrisons and grandly
       outfitted, in 1911, but demolished <hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1958. </p>

      <p>Records indicate that the Cornwallis family (and notably Sir William Cornwallis) were major
       patrons to entertainers both at Brome Hall in Suffolk and (after 1588) at their palatial
       house and grounds in Highgate, a village five miles north of London on the Great North Road. </p>

      <p>The most illustrative example of their patronage at Brome arises from a court of Star
       Chamber case brought by Sir William Cornwallis (<hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1549-1611), eldest
       son of Sir Thomas Cornwallis (1518/19-1604), against Thomas Swift (b. 1569), a talented
       lutenist and singer who, from the age of ten, had been a musician in the Cornwallis
       household. During that time he developed a romantic attachment with Cornwallis’s young
       daughter Frances. In his suit Cornwallis claimed that Swift had attempted to entrap Frances,
       aged fifteen, into a false and binding contract of marriage. Agreeing with the plaintiff, the
       court convicted Swift of using fraud and blackmail to achieve his aim. The court further
       found that Swift had been substantively aided in his plot to seduce the young heiress by the
       well-known translator and poet, Thomas Watson (1555-92), who at the time of the plotting was
       serving as private tutor to John (1573-94), young son of Sir William Cornwallis, in his
       preparations to enter Cambridge University. During and after Swift’s subsequent imprisonment
       in the Marshalsea, he complained to the privy council that Cornwallis was exacting vengeful
       punishment against him by using his power to make Swift’s living conditions in prison much
       worse than they would normally have been, in everything from food to bedding. Concerned to
       preserve his reputation, Cornwallis wrote a letter (see TNA: SP 46/45 Darnell Papers, item
       458, 15 March 1592/3) to Sir Thomas Heneage, member of the privy council, describing his
       support for and patronage of Swift since the young man’s indigent childhood. It is that
       letter that provides evidence of the Cornwallis patronage at Brome.</p>

      <p>As Cornwallis alleged in the letter, Swift’s father, a struggling Norwich grocer, had
       encountered Cornwallis in Norwich, during the 1578 progress of Elizabeth I and, with the
       assistance of Thomas Churchyard (<hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1523-1604), had persuaded
       Cornwallis to take the boy, then about ten years of age, into service. As Cornwallis put it:
       'I would incourage him [Swift] to increase his knowledge in musike and singing wherein I
       delighted, and wherein nature had gend him some extroordinary gift' (Bodl: Tanner MS 97, f
       35). Swift would remain in the Cornwallis household at Brome for ten years, from 1578 to
       1588. When Cornwallis bought his Highgate house in 1588, Swift remained with the family at
       Highgate for another six years, until 1594. All parties agree that during Swift’s sixteen
       years with Cornwallis, he was well-treated by the family. Some years later, when
       Cornwallis’anger had apparently cooled, he made a request to Elizabeth I that she pardon
       Swift, which she did.</p>

      <p>Sir William Cornwallis’s self-proclaimed love of music and patronage of performers is
       well-supported by other evidences in the records. The Cornwallis family supported several
       other musicians at Brome Hall. One was Robert Sprignall, described by Cornwallis as 'a fellow
       for many years in my howse in musike matters.’ It was Sprignall who advised Swift (concerning
       this legal case) 'to confess all immediately, as "the only meanes to winne favor"'
       (Chatterley, ‘Two Sixteenth-Century East Anglian Families,’ p 125). In seeking to move from
       Cornwallis’ service to that of Robert Devereux, nineteenth earl of Essex, Swift was assisted
       by another musician in Cornwallis’ household. Robert Hales, a singer, later claimed to have
       ‘commended Swift to the Earl’s service for his voice and honesty’ (Chatterley, Two
       Sixteenth-Century East Anglian Families,’ p 121).</p>

      <p>While still living at Brome Hall, Elizabeth Cornwallis, the sister of Sir William, was
       patron to the young John Wilbey, who would become the greatest composer of madrigals in the
       age. When Elizabeth married Sir Thomas Kitson and moved to Hengrave Hall, she (now Elizabeth
       Kitson) took Wilby with her, and gathered other major musicians in the household. The
       Cornwallis and Kitson households together were a major cultural force in Suffolk.</p>

      <p>The Cornwallis involvement in performance and patronage extended far beyond Suffolk to
       London and the Court, an involvement with which Thomas Swift would have been well aware. To
       cite two examples, Cornwallis staged May game-themed entertainments for Elizabeth I four
       times at Highgate (on <hi rend="italic">c</hi> June 11 1589; Jun 7 1594; September 13, 18,
       and 19 1597; and 1 May 1601 (Chambers, <title>Elizabethan Stage</title>, vol 4, pp 104, 108,
       111, 113). On 1 May 1604 Cornwallis hosted at Highgate a commissioned entertainment written
       and produced for the occasion by Ben Jonson, entitled <title>A Private Entertainment of the
        King and Queen, on May Day in the morning, at Sir William Cornwallis his house, at Highgate,
        1604</title>. It was, as James Knowles puts it, the first of a series of ‘aristocratic
       entertainments which parallel the court masque commissions.’ In it Jonson ‘reshapes the
       conventions of Elizabethan pastoral shows for the new joint monarchy of England and
       Scotland,’ but built around May Day customs (Ben Jonson, "<ref
        target="https://universitypublishingonline.org/cambridge/benjonson/k/works/highgate/facing/#"
        >A Private Entertainment ... at Highgate</ref>," James Knowles (ed), <title>The Cambridge
        Edition of the Works of Ben Jonson Online</title>, accessed 27 December 2024.</p>

      <p> Sir Roger Woodhouse (Wodehouse)(<hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1541–88), of Kimberley, Norfolk,
       was MP for Aldeborough, Suffolk. He was the son of Thomas Wodehouse and Margaret Shelton and
       was married to Mary Corbet, daughter of John Corbet (1514-59) of Sprowston, Norfolk.</p>

      <p>
       <rs ref="eats:373659" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Kimberley</rs> is a small village located
       three and half miles north of Wymondham. In 1578 it had a moated hall with a tower, and
       Elizabeth I stayed in the hall during her progress through Suffolk and Norfolk. The old hall
       was demolished in 1659 and replaced by the present Kimberley Hall, in the parish of
       Wymondham.</p>

      <p> Woodrising is a village five miles west of Kimberley and northwest of Wymondham. It was
       the home of Sir Robert Southwell (15631598), high sheriff of Norfolk, 1589–90. As an admiral
       and a ship commander, Southwell would take part in the battle with the Spanish Armada in
       1588. He was married to Elizabeth Howard, a lady in waiting to Elizabeth I and daughter of
       Charles Howard, tenth earl of Nottingham, himself a cousin of the queen. The queen stayed at
       Woodrising Hall, home of Sir Robert, for four days, before moving on to Thetford. The moated
       hall where she stayed was taken down in the eighteenth century.</p>

      <p> Sir Edward Clere (1536–1606), of Blickling, Norfolk, was married to Frances Fulmerston

       Bedfordshire. Radcliffe had no obvious connections to Cratfield and the amount given is
       typical of what a travelling company would have received, so it is likely that his servants
       were touring entertainers. </p>

      <p> Richard Scrivener (f 9) often appears in the accounts as a guest in December and January.
       His name immediately follows or precedes a payment to a harper a number of times, but only in
       this entry are he and the harper connected by an ampersand. Scrivener remains unidentified,
       but Swabey assumes that he was a scrivener who performed important service for Agnes de
       Bryene (<title>Medieval Gentlewoman</title>, p 127). </p>

      <p> According to Ffiona Swabey, two women, both named Agnes Whyte or White (f 9v), were
       occasionally present at the dinners of Alice de Bryene, and were both present on 11 May 1413.
       Swabey describes Agnes White, wife of John, as a household member who buys and sells produce,
       and Agnes Whyte, wife of Alex, as a household member who sells produce (pp 127, 180).</p>

      <p> Sir Richard Waldegrave (f 10; <hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1380–1435) was the son of another
       Sir Richard Waldegrave (<hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1338–1410), who had been steward of the
       estates of Queen Anne in Norfolk and Suffolk by 1382, was JP for Suffolk and Essex, and was a
       member of Richard II's council from 1393 through 1397. The younger Waldegrave, like his
       father before him, was lord of the Manor of Bures St Mary, with residence at Smallbridge Hall
       in Bures St Mary, Suffolk. His father, the elder Sir Richard, had married the widowed mother
       of Dame Alice de Bryene in 1363. Their son, the Sir Richard of these records, was the
       half-brother of Alice, and was often a guest at her table. </p>

      <p> John Blake remains unidentified but other references in the account offer glimpses.
       Between 17 April and 16 May the accounts extraordinarily list Blake as a guest forty-three
       times, nineteen of those as a guest for the entire day. He is once listed with a minstrel,
       twice with a member of his household, and once with his son. Otherwise he appears alone in
       the accounts. In sum, he seems to have been a gentleman of some substance, who had a
       household of his own, and who was favoured as a guest by Dame Alice. </p>

      <p> The witches' gathering may have had to do with Plough Monday activities, the day on which
        <rs ref="eats:373866" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Dennington's</rs> churchwardens' accounts
       were declared and new wardens appointed (f [1]). Joseph Strutt's <title>The Sports and
        Pastimes of the People of England</title>, J. Charles Cox (ed), rev ed(London, 1903), p 274,
       observes that in nineteenth-century Huntingdonshire, the mummers on Plough Monday were
       referred to as 'Plough- Witchers,' but he offers no in-period evidence illustrating the use
       of witches' gatherings on Plough Monday. Whether the witches in Dennington were gathering for
       the parish on Plough Monday, and whether they were male or female, is unclear, but they do
       seem to have been involved in a traditional custom that may or may not have had mimetic
       elements. A Christmas ale held by the parish in 1500 (see Ipswich, Suffolk Archives HD
       1260/1, f [2v]), and the lord of misrule in this account, would together appear to confirm
       that church ales and mimetic entertainments were sometimes connected in Dennington. </p>

      <p> This entry presents two sets of names. A note in the left margin indicates that the first
       two names (Thomas Copping and Robert Aleyn) are members of the twenty-four burgesses, one of
       the two governing bodies of the town. Court headings on ff 101 and 121v provide further
       confirmation. To the right of Copping and Aleyn is a second entry giving the names of the
       town's three waits: Anthonie Padnall, William Ryme, and Thomas Burradge. In 1609 a Thomas
       Burrage would appear in the Ipswich civic records as a member of the city's company of
       musicians and would serve as master of that company from 1613 through 1637 (see his will). In
       1614 the Dunwich Common Assembly does not name Burrage as being among their waits (f 261). It
       seems like that the Dunwich and Ipswich Burrages were one and the same person. Burrage had
       likely moved to Ipswich because by that time Dunwich had all but disappeared as a town. The

       for juratores (municipal officers). </p>

      <p> The interrogatories for March–May also asked questions related to the defendants' claims
       concerning the plaintiff: whether the defendants had knowledge that the plaintiff Corbold had
       engaged in usury, or had otherwise cheated anyone financially, or had comitted <rs
        ref="eats:45689" type="CrimesMisdemeanors">adultery</rs>, or improperly fattened then sold
       cattle, or had caused forfeiture by anyone to whom he had lent money; or that the defendants
       themselves had called the plaintiff 'Burnt Breche,' or had asked a poor boy whose mother the
       plaintiff had befriended whether he was in fact 'younge Grymbold,' all of which are alluded
       to in the ballad.</p>

      <p> On 26 June, defendant Hullock Everard, in answering interrogatories 14 and 15, admits that
       in speaking to one Thomas Howard he referred to the plaintiff as Grombold. In responding to
       interrogatory 9, his wife Prudence gives the same answer as her husband: her daughter and
       another girl living with them at the time had sung words from the libellous ballad in the
       family's house (dorse). </p>

      <p> The Hadleigh guildhall (known today as 'The Hadleigh Town Hall and Guildhall Complex' is a
       fifteenth-century, timber-framed building sitting by the churchyard, facing the parish church
       of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The complex has three principal sections. The center section,
       constructed <hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1451, is the Market Hall, a three-storey building 'with
       two shops built below.' To its left (as one faces the complex), constructed in 1433, is an
       attached two-storey structure now called the Long Room. It was described as 'one long house
       newly constructed called le markethows.' Its ground floor contained two almshouses, and its
       first floor was 'the former guildhall proper.' Behind the three-storey Market Hall, also
       dating from the mid-fifteenth century, is a detached hall, known today as the Guildhall
       (having replaced the Long Room in that capacity). It came to be used by Hadleigh's five
       religious guilds for their meetings and banquets. The feoffees' order makes clear that the
       town had been using the guildhall for weddings and the staging of plays that might run into
       the evening hours. On the Guildhall-Town Hall complex, see Pevsner, <title>Suffolk</title>, p
       245; Andrews, <title>Inventory</title>, p 18; and Andrews and Springall, <title>Hadleigh and
        the Alabaster Family</title>, p 10. On the use of the guildhall and the area outside it for
       plays and other diversions, see Marjorie Keniston McIntosh, <title>Poor Relief and Community
        in Hadleigh, Suffolk, 1547–1600</title> (Hatfield, Hertfordshire, 2013), 12-13. </p>

         type="Thing_BookPlayMusic">Book</rs>. And yet not my Booke. For it was but a borrowed

         type="Place_PA_Settlement">Hadley</rs>, who with some difficulty lent it me, hauing no
        other coppy of this English Lesson which he prepared for a By-exercise for his schollars at
        the last Carneual. He told me that hee huddled it vp in hast, and that it being onely an
        essay of his owne faculty, and of the actiuity of his tenderlings, he was loath it should
        come vnder <pb n="[2]"/> any other eye, then of those Parents and domestique friends who
        fauourably beheld it, when it was represented by the children. And therefore, I must be, and
        am tender of suffering it to wander I know not whither, by the out let of your friends hand:
        whom as I know not, so I cannot challenge of any trust; but require restitution of you, as
        the Author doth of me. So, expecting without delay, the return of this bird into the cage, I
        end with a threat, that if you faile, you must looke to haue this Comedy turned into a
        Tragedy, and, for detaining this booke, to haue your name set on the backside of my booke.

       <ab>Louing, Challenging, Threatening friend, E. W. I pray you extend your loue so farre to
        your friend, and your friends friend, as to thinke that neither the first will defraud you
        of your borrowed Booke, nor the second expose the Author to any inconuenience. The truth is,
        my friend, vpon the sight of this Morall, Scholasticall, Theatricall Treatise, protested
        that the Author should receiue much right in being thus wronged; and vpon sufficient bond
        vndertooke to saue me harmelesse if I made it more publique than euer was intended. And
        withall hee armed me with a legall defence, that, if I restored tenne fold for the
        principall, the Author (notwithstanding his modesty) could frame no iust quarrell against me
        or you at the barre of iustice <pb/><!-- IN for PG: Extra <pb> here?--> or reputation.
        Accordingly he incouraged me (if Master Schoolmaster of Hadley should schoole you for
        promise-breach) to stop his mouth with a dozen of chickens hatcht vnder his owne henne.</ab>

      <p> According to Bentley, the play was first performed by students in the schoolroom of
       Hadleigh School. The boys must have been a talented lot. Bentley notes that Joseph Beaumont,
       who played two roles and delivered the Epilogue, was a friend of Crashaw, and the author of
        <title>Psyche, or Love's Mystery</title>. John Kidby, another of the actors, would later
       have a part in Peter Haustead's <title>Rival Friends</title> at Cambridge. Bentley praises
       the play as 'more amusing than one might expect,' its quality suggesting that 'there may have
       been more dramatic talent in Caroline schools than is generally thought' (<title>Jacobean and
        Caroline Stage</title>, vol 4, pp 538–9). He cites with caution the argument of the play's
       first editor that the play is 'a general imitation of [Ben Jonson's] <title>Cynthia's
        Revels</title>' (p 539); see Rhoads (ed), <title>Wm. Hawkins' Apollo Shroving</title>, pp
       84–70). According to Jones, <title>Hadleigh Through the Ages</title>, p 57, a few lines of
       this play 'may perhaps have been in the mind of John Milton writing <title>Paradise
        Lost</title> forty years later. Jones, p 57, observes that <title>Corolla Varia</title>
       'contains Latin poems recited by [students of] the school before some members of that
       university who had come to Hadleigh to escape the plague at Cambridge in 1630.' </p>

      <p> The lord of Clarence (f 20) who was owed 20s was George Plantagenet (1449–77/8), third
       duke of Clarence from 1461, with residence at Warwick Castle.</p>

      <p>Edward Plantagenet (28 April 1442-9 April 1483), son of Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York,
       and Cecily Neville, was Edward IV, King of England 1461-70 (when deposed), then restored as
       king from 1471 until his death in 1483. See <ref
        target="https://library2.utm.utoronto.ca/otra/reed/node/316583">P&amp;P</ref>.</p>

      <p> The previous payment was at Westminster, and to the king's minstrels, so this event
       probably occurred in London.</p>

      <p> A number of entries in the accounts (ff 46v, 50v–51v, 52v, 64v, 67v, 82, 132v, 135, 137,
       138–8v) are payments for 'baytynge' during Sir John Howard's travels. In this context, the
       word appears simply to mean the providing of food and drink for his horses, as on f 132v a
       payment for baiting his horse.</p>
      <p> On f 48, Howard reimbursed Sir William Warner for money laid out at tennis. </p>

      <p> The hockpot (f 65) was the container that in many communities held the proceeds from a
       post-Easter game, a mock battle, in which the women of the parish 'captured' the men with
       ropes, pulling their captives to them and granting their release when the men had paid a
       contribution to the parish fund. This uniquely English game is generally thought to dramatize
       what had originally been the celebration of an English defeat of, and liberation from, the
       rule of the Danish king Hardicnute in 1041, or a similar battlefield event (Joseph Strutt,
        <title>The Sports and Pastimes of the People of England</title> (London, 1903), 274–5). </p>

      <p> A hockpot (pp 510–11) was the container that held the proceeds from a post- Easter mimetic
       game in which women 'captured' men with ropes, pulling their captives to them. The men earned
       their freedom by making a contribution to the parish fund. This uniquely English game is
       generally thought to dramatize what had originally been a celebration of the English defeat
       of, and liberation from, the rule of Hardicnut in 1041, or of a similar event (Strutt and
       Cox, <title>Sports and Pastimes</title>, pp 274–5).</p>

      <p> According to Botfield, the payment occurs on f 45 of a book of Howard's accounts now lost.
       On f 45 of Add. MS 46349 there is an 'It<ex>em</ex> delivred to the wyves in party off
       payment,' but there is no indication of what the payment was for.</p>

      <p> According to Botfield, the payment on p 511 occurs on f 45v of a book of Howard's accounts
       now lost.</p>

      <p> Thomas Moleyns was a senior member of Howard's household, entrusted with financial and
       business matters of many kinds, including reimbursements, payments of wages, collections of
       rents, purchasing in London and elsewhere, delivery of a warrant to the king's man, and more,
       amply recorded in the Howard accounts. On 26 August 1463 he received payment for 24 'tawyd'
       (dressed) sheep skins (f 47). On 5 May 1464 Howard advanced him 40s to purchase fish for the
       household at Manningtree (f 66). Two days late, the lord reimbursed him for having taken
       wages to a member of the household (66v). On 11 April 1466 he received several reimbursements
       for travelling to London on his lord's behalf (travel and food for himself and his companion,
       the copying of a letter, and entertaining of a king's man, and so on) (f 111v). Acting as a
       collector, Moleyns delivered £6 to Howard on 1 January 1466/7 (f 131). On 11 June 1467 acting
       on behalf of Howard, Moleyns disbursed parcels of money totalling £6 for the crew of Howard's
       ship, The Edward, preparatory to a voyage to Calais (f 140). Other of Moleyns' important
       sevices to Howard are recorded on ff 86, 138v, 141, 148, and 150v. </p>

     <div type="endnote">
      <p> In late spring 1481 (f 4v, col 2), after negotiations between England and Scotland to
       establish a peace treaty had failed and the Scots had increased their raiding and pillaging
       of the English borderlands, Edward IV ordered a military campaign against the Scots, led by
       Richard, duke of Gloucester (by land) in concert with the forces of Sir John Howard (by sea).
       Howard took command of a fleet of eight ships carrying 3,000 men and set out for the Firth of
       Forth, where he successfully engaged and defeated the unprepared local Scots. The remaining
       part of Howard's contribution to the campaign involved often unsuccessful raiding forays
       along the Scottish coast before his sixteen-week commission came to an end (see Anne
       Crawford, <title>Yorkist Lord: John Howard, Duke of Norfolk, c. 1425-1486</title> (London,
       2010), 91–4).</p>

      <p> John Luter, who is named on f 5v, col 2, appears as the first name in a list of nine men
       under the heading 'Se<ex>n</ex>cler.' This same list of nine men occurs in the entry on f 20
       below, where it says that they were impressed by John Sencler (Sinclair?), gentleman, into
       the Duke's forces. </p>

      <p> On f 42, these two payments, plus one for his drink, were made to John Sherle, armourer.
       The single sum of xxvij s. viij d. is the total for both entries concerning Sherle's work on
       banners and standards. </p>

      <p> On f 91v, the lord of Gloucester whose trumpets were being paid was Richard Plantagenet
       (1452–1485), lord protector from 1483, third duke of Gloucester from 1 November 1461, and
       king of England from 1483. </p>

      <p> The lady Norfolk (f 92) whose minstrels were paid was Elizabeth (Talbot) Mowbray (<hi
        rend="italic">c</hi> 1435-1507), dowager duchess of Norfolk, widow of John de Mowbray
       (1444-1475/6), fourth Duke of Norfolk, with residence (among other places) at Framlingham
       Castle, Suffolk. </p>

      <p> The lord of Buckingham (f 94v) whose minstrels were paid was Henry Stafford (1455–83),
       second duke of Buckingham from 1460, with residences at Penshurst, Kent and Stafford Castle,
       Staffordshire. He was beheaded. </p>

      <p> On f 105, concerning the children of the chapel whose patins and points were paid for by
       Howard on f 105, Collier claims that Howard kept four to six children (the number varied) for
       his chapel at Stoke, where the records show that he paid for their services, livery,
       sustenance, and instruction. He retained one 'Gorum, master of the children of St Anthony'
        (<title>Household Books</title>, p xxii–xxiii; see f 116). Both the mansion at Stoke and the
       Lord's Chapel had organs and music books, so the children likely performed in both religious
       and festive settings. </p>

       parliament ended on 18 February 1482/3 and so was not yet a knight when called Mr Woodes in
       the Howard account book. His residences were Ryvers Hall, Sussex and East Molesey Manor in

      <p> Concerning the payments to harpers on f 90, Howard arrived in Norwich on 19 August. On
       that same day, he made a series of payments, including those to the harpers. </p>

      <p> Entries on ff 90v and 91 further confirm that Howard was continuing to progress from town
       to town. On 22 August (f 90v) he paid performers in Durham and later that same day in
       Thetford. About 10 entries later, the date given in the records is Sunday, 24 August. On that
       same day (f 91) the records indicate that his journey had taken him to Bury St Edmunds. Three
       entries later, on Sunday 24 August, the prior of Thetford 'paid for my Lord at Bury, for his
       offering ther, followed by some further payments for offerings and alms at Bury. Then the
       Prior paid Buckingham's trumpet 'at the said town [Bury]'. Four entries later he gave 20s 'to
       the offecerys of the Abbey of Bury.' Thus the payment on f 91 was made at Bury, not Thetford. </p>

      <p> The trumpets paid on f 91 were those of Henry Stafford (1455–1483), second duke of
       Buckingham from 1460, with residences at Penshurst, Kent, and Stafford Castle, Stafordshire. </p>

      <p> The earl of Kent whose minstrel received a reward on f 91 was Edmund Grey (1416–1490),
       eleventh earl of Kent from 30 May 1465, with residences at Wrest Park, Bedfordshire, and
       Ruthin Castle, Denbighshire. </p>

      <p> Of possible relevance to the payment made to Robin Hood for his arrows on f 100, on 3
       October one John a Godsalfe and John Skelton (likely the poet and playwright then in the
       duke's household) both received money from the accountant to purchase their livery gowns (f
       101). </p>

      <p> The constitution shows the connection between the procession and the pageants, some of
       which (the Ship Pageant, for example) clearly had dramatic content. The striking feature of
       the list giving the order of companies (and some pageants) in the procession is that the
       references to saints, in red ink beside bracketed companies, have been scratched out (though
       they remain readable under ultraviolet). The only pageants permitted to remain from those in
       red were the dolphin and the ship, perhaps because Ipswich was so important a port. </p>

       <ab>At this court they elected John Regner to the civic burgessy, but under this condition:
        that from henceforth he will remain and reside in the town of Ipswich and, of course, that
        he will be a helper in all matters for the pageant of Corpus Christi according to his
        ability in making and correcting the book of Corpus Christi, and he will have nothing
        besides (these obligations). And he was sworn.</ab>

       <ab>At this court, Nicholas Baker, John Hamond, Edmund Smyth, Roger Mascall, Thomas Halle,
        William Lunt, John Goche, and Thomas Stubbe have been demoted from their burgessies unless
        they come before the next court, etc, to say whether they have anything (to say) for
        them(selves), to say they know why they should not lose their liberty of the burgessy
        because they did not wish to pay for the sustenance of the guild of Corpus Christi according
        to the regulation and custom of the town Ipswich as they had been sworn, etc.</ab>

       <ab>At this court they elected the wardens of the guild of Corpus Christi, namely, Vincent
        Feryngton, John Keche, Thomas Phelyps and Robert Halle, sherman, for the following year and
        they (ordered) that they shall keep the dinner as they were formerly accustomed to–any act
        made earlier to the contrary notwithstanding– and that each burgess shall pay 16d for the
        dinner.</ab>

       <ab>At the same court they granted for the maintenance of the pageant the same sum for the
        craftsmen as they had last year.</ab>

       <ab>⸿ It has been determined that from henceforth the play or 'the pageant' which for a long
        time was performed on Corpus Christi day and sometimes was not performed at any time
        [anything by noble] now it has been agreed that from henceforth in perpetuity it will be
        observed and maintained. And to support that, a certain craftsman appropriate for that
        (purpose) will have 40s annually for a fixed term, which ought to be levied in the following
        manner, namely 16d from each councillor, and also 24s 8d which amounts to 32s, and the rest,
        that is 8s, is to be levied from [remaining inhabitants] twenty-four citizens.</ab>

       <ab>Moreover, it was ordained that no baillif during his time (in office) shall impede or do
        anything so that the play or 'the aforesaid pageant' not be held on the said Corpus Christi
        day unless it be by portmanmoot court or some other special thing under penalty of £40 of
        each baillif for the use of the aforesaid guild.</ab>

       <ab>Thomas Baldry and William Ropkyn, bailiffs, nominated Robert Godwyn and Richard Leneacre
        to collect money for the pagent on Corpus Christi day.</ab>

      <p> A subsequent order, also on p 188, directs that the guild's many utensils (spoons, dishes,
       and so on) be kept safe. A connection between the play and the dinner (if there was any) is
       not clearly indicated in the records. Corpus Christi orders by the guild do often mention the
       play and dinner together in the same order, and the guild often pays for the building of <rs
        ref="eats:302248" type="Thing_SetMachinery">scaffolds</rs> as part of guild feasts, which
       could indicate that the Corpus Christi play was indoors and was, therefore, intended for a
       small, privileged audience of <rs ref="eats:297065" type="Collective_Office">burgesses</rs>
       and their wives as part of the feast (making the utensils a useful bit of evidence). But to
       take those considerations as fact would be to go beyond the evidence. </p>

      <p> Thomas Brandon, an entertainer, was a servant to Henry VIII. Although the King referred to
       him as 'our pleyer,' Brandon was neither an actor nor a juggler but, as John Southworth puts
       it, a 'stage magician' (a 'tregatour' or 'prestigiator' in Latin usage). That he was much
       favoured is clear in that in 1522 Henry VIII requested the City of London to make him a
       freeman of the city, with the occupation of leather seller, a position that made it possible
       for Brandon to hire out his performing skills to the companies of London, bypassing the
       monopolistic control of the city's musicians and actors guild. Brandon traveled widely to
       perform throughout the kingdom, in venues as widely scattered as Shrewsbury, Thetford Priory
       in Norfolk, Exeter, and Barnstaple. He often performed at civic venues, including mayors'
       houses, on local celebration days. He was even cited with grudging admiration for his
       illusionist's skills by Reginald Scott <title>Discoverie of Witchcraft</title> indicating
       that his fame had survived his death (Southworth, <title>Fools and Jesters at the English
        Court</title> (Stroud, 1998), 94–9).</p>

      <p> The Ipswich civic records indicate that the town annually sponsored several processions as
       part of its celebration of Corpus Christi. As this order indicates, a civic procession of
       pageants, accompanied by the entire population of the town, occurred on <rs ref="eats:41497"
        type="CalendarDay_Liturgical">Corpus Christi Day</rs> itself (Thursday of Corpus Christi
       week). The entire population also took part in a purely liturgical procession spanning Corpus
       Christi Day and the day after, in which they accompanied the Sacrament of Corpus Christi from
       the Church of St Lawrence to the fishmarket on the Corn Hill to the St Mary Tower Church,
       thence to Margaret's Green and around the town, arriving again at St Mary Tower Church where
       they heard a mass. The following day, the population accompanied the Sacrament on a return
       journey (this time including Brook Street) to the Church of St Lawrence. The portmen of the
       town, the twenty-four burgesses, and the torchers, all bearing torches, accompanied the Holy
       Sacrament (pp 215, 220). The records give no indication that the liturgical processions
       included pageantry or involved performance. </p>

      <p> James Lockwood (f [3]) was jester to Henry VIII, Mary, and Elizabeth I in turn. He appears
       in performance records between 1540/1 (at Nottingham) and 1570/1(at Leicester), as well as
       numerous other places. He is variously identified in performance records as 'the Kynges
       bourdar' and, almost always, as the king or queen's servant and/or jester. His travels to
       perform included an extraordinary number of cities and large towns throughout the kingdom
       (most often among them Leicester), and he is described by John Southworth as one among
       numerous 'semi-independent, peripatetic jesters' who performed in civic and private venues
       during the Tudor period, though he was never actually recorded at a performance before the
       Court (see Southworth, <title>Fools and Jesters at the English Court</title> (Stroud, 1998),
       98–9).</p>

      <p> Peter Moone, a resident of <rs ref="eats:369522" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Ipswich</rs>,
       was a tailor, actor, theatre-manager, gospeller, and radical reformist. According to John
       Webb, who has written a detailed article about him, he 'was a well-known character in the
       Tudor town' ('Peter Moone,' pp 35–55). He and his wife are recorded as having lived first in
       St Mary Tower parish, then in St Stevens parish, both in the North Ward. He sometimes drummed
       at musters for the town until giving way in that task in 1586–7 to John Minter, the town's
       newly appointed official drummer. In 1571–2 he was paid for drum heads and drum sticks
       (C/3/2/1/1, f 42v); he had repaired the town's ancient in 1578–9, and had repaired the town
       drum in 1586-7 (C/3/4/1/18, f 5v). Although Webb describes Moone as of 'low social status,'
       the many references to him in the records suggest a substantial person (though of limited
       financial means and always seeking ways to make money). Though originally a 'foreigner,' he
       was a burgess by 1560 (the year before his troupe performed) and he would serve as a burgess
       for the final twenty-eight years of his life. In 1581 he was fined for not wearing his gown
       at official ceremonies. In 1585, when town officials were particularly exercised about the
       proliferation of seditious rhymes, they hired (and paid the exorbitant amount of 30 li) to
       Moone to sleuth out the identity of two anonymous rhymers. He succeeded in identifying one of
       the two. He was a notable among his fellow burgesses, and was a trusted member of St Stephens
       parish in that he presented on behalf of the parish their contribution of 2d per in year's
       wages for the preacher (C/3/4/1/18, f 1; Webb, 'Peter Moone,' pp 35, 43–5).</p>

      <p> Of particular resonance concerning this collection, Moone was one of the group of radical
       thinkers and writers present in Ipswich in the 1540's. In 1548 he published 'A short treatise
       of certayne things abused in the Popysh Church,' 'a rhyming tract of thirty-seven eight-line
       stanzas.' The tract is reprinted in Webb, 'Peter Moone,' pp 46-52. Moone's use of language
       shows him to have been a talented writer. While the tract is a sermon of sorts, in form it is
       a dramatic monologue. In the first stanza, he refers to 'this audience.' During the reign of
       Mary, he was fined and jailed in London for four months on suspicion of conspiracy and during
       the subsequent reign he acted as a source of contemporary witness by John Foxe in his
        <title>Acts and Monuments</title>. Some scholars have postulated that when Queen Elizabeth
       visited Ipswich on 5–11 August, 1561 – arriving by boat from Dunmow, Essex – the program of
       events staged in her honor included a performance by Moone's troupe of John Bale's
        <title>King Johan</title>. However, no evidence to confirm that suggestion has yet come to
       light (Webb, 'Peter Moone,' pp 37–8, 42).</p>

      <p> Whether Moone's troupe comprised actors recruited for this one event or was a sustaining
       troupe whose patron was Moone is impossible to know.</p>

      <p> Katherine Willoughby (1518/19–80) was likely twelfth Baroness Willoughby of Eresby,
       duchess of Suffolk, with seats at Grimsthorpe Castle and Tattershall Castle, Lincolnshire

      <p> Romsey (f [3v]) was almost certainly John Ramsey, a carver or joiner, and the same Ramsey
       who was paid by the burgesses two years later for staging another play on 8 December
       (C/3/2/1/1, f 8). Ramsey was part of a group of radical reformists including Peter Moone and
       Richard Argentine <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> Sexten who were active in Ipswich from the
       1530's on. A talented group, they wrote and published their own anti-Catholic tracts as well
       as those of continental authors, and preached in the town, reciting their own tracts which
       combined poetry, dramatic monologue, politics, and evangelical arguments underpinned by
       scriptural quotations (Webb, 'Peter Moone,' p 36). Ramsey is thought to have authored the
       undated <title>A Corosyfe to be layed hard unto the hartes of all faythfull Professours of
        Christes Gospel, Gathered out of the sciptures by Iohn Ramsey</title>. Given the evangelical
       content of the work, its sermonly rhetorical approach, and the fact that Ramsey was nearly 60
       years old in 1562-3, together with the fact that Ramsey was 'an uncommon Ipswich surname,'
       Webb concludes that 'he <del>Ramsey</del> may well have been described as "Father"'('Peter
       Moone,' p 42). Ramsey also served as bailiff of Ipswich Manor of Christchurch for Edmund
       Withipoll in the mid-1540's, suffered for his views during the reign of Mary, and, like
       Moone, later served as a contemporary witness for John Foxe in his writing of <title>Acts and
        Monuments</title> (Webb, pp 36, 38).</p>

      <p> John de Vere (1516–62) was sixteenth earl of Oxford from 21 March 1539/40, with residence

      <p> Ramsey (f 8) was almost certainly John Ramsey, a carver or joiner, who was part of a group
       of radical reformists including Peter Moone and Richard Argentine, alias Sexten, who were
       active in Ipswich from the 1530's on. A talented group, they wrote and published their own
       anti-Catholic tracts as well as those of continental authors, and preached in the town
       reciting their own tracts which combined poetry, dramatic monologue, politics, and
       evangelical arguments underpinned by scriptural quotations (Webb, 'Peter Moone,' p 36).
       Ramsey is thought to have authored the undated <title>A Corosyfe to be layed hard unto the
        hartes of all faythfull Professours of Christes Gospel, Gathered out of the sciptures by
        Iohn Ramsey</title>. Given the evangelical content of the work, its sermonly rhetorical
       approach, and the fact that Ramsey was nearly sixty years old in 1562–3, together with the
       fact that Ramsey was 'an uncommon Ipswich surname,' Webb concludes that 'he [Ramsey] may well
       have been described as "Father"' ('Peter Moone,' p 42). Ramsey also served as bailiff of the
       Ipswich manor of Christchurch for Edmund Withipoll in the mid-1540's, suffered for his views
       during the reign of Mary, and, like Moone, later served as a contemporary witness for John
       Foxe in his writing of <title>Acts and Monuments</title> ('Peter Moone,' pp 36, 38). </p>

      <p> The heading of this <rs ref="eats:414480" type="Collective_Office">treasurer's</rs>
       account (by the treasurer, Robert Sallowse) says that it was made on 8 December in 10
       Elizabeth for the year before (that is, for 1567–8). But the heading does not specify the
       year, as most of the accounts in this series do. The account immediately follows the
       treasurer's account for 1577–8 (by Henry Hannam), and precedes Hannam's account for 1578–9,
       and has thus been placed out of sequence in the volume of accounts. Allen confirms that
       Robert Sallowse served as Treasurer at least four times: in 1562-3, 1564-5, 1565-6 and 1568-8

       troupe performed on Corpus Christi days, guild feasts, and the bailiffs' entries into the
       city and their official departures therefrom. The troupe also performed as actors, as
       evidenced by payments to them for 'plaing the ffoles in the halle' in 1568–9 (C/3/3/2/9, f
       [10v]) and for 'a play at the Mote hall' in 1571–2 (C/3/3/2/12, f [4]). Martin further served
       as the clerk of the Market (see Stokes, 'Waits,' pp 19–21). </p>

      <p> The players of Norwich (f 98v) were likely the waits of Norwich, since there exists no
       evidence that the City of Norwich financially supported a dedicated company of actors. There
       is, however, evidence that, in addition to their music, the Norwich waits received the city's
       permission to act in comedies, interludes, and tragedies. David Galloway assumed that all
       those performances by the waits as actors occurred locally, and he found no evidence
       indicating that the company toured. If the troupe that was paid in Ipswich on 8 August 1575
       was the waits, that would be the first record confirming that the waits did indeed tour. On
       the Norwich waits as actors, see Galloway, <title>Norwich</title>, pp xxxi, xxxix, lxxxvi n
       3, and 57.</p>

       described as <rs ref="eats:279117" type="Collective_Occupations">clerk</rs> of the Market,
       for which he was paid 40s in wages and an additional 26s 8d 'for lokinge to the butchers'

       for various reasons, to pay a local subsidy tax charged to those who had achieved a certain
       level of wealth. </p>

      <p> Having a minstrel serve as clerk of the Market was not without precedent. In 1575–6 and
       again in 1576–7 William Martin, master of the town's company of waits at that time, was paid
       both his quarterly wages as clerk of the Market and additional payments by warrant for his
       music at the annual guild dinner (C/3/2/1/1, f 102 and C/3/4/1/9, f [3v]). The records give
       no indication that Johnson was one of the town waits under the mastership of either William
       Martin or John Bettes, though he well may have been one of Martin's waits since the members
       of Martin's troupe are never named in the records. </p>

      <p> William Martin (f 135v) was master of a company of five musicians who served as the <rs
        ref="eats:406229" type="Collective_Office">waits of Ipswich</rs> between 1561 and 1582. The
       troupe performed on Corpus Christi days, guild feasts, and the bailiffs' entries into the
       city and their official departures therefrom. The troupe also performed as actors, as
       evidenced by payments to them for 'plaing the ffoles in the halle' in 1568–9 (C/3/3/2/9, f
       [10v]) and for 'a play at the Mote hall' in 1571–2 (C/3/3/2/12, f [4]). Martin further served
       as the clerk of the Market (see Stokes, 'Waits,' pp 19–21). </p>

      <p> John Kynge (f 136) is identified in the records as a scrivener and schoolmaster, though
       there is no indication that he was the headmaster of Ipswich school. He was talented in
       making pageants and staging celebrations, shows and dramatizations, which the town paid him
       to do between 1578 and 1584, at which point he appears to have had a falling out with the
       town's officials and ceased to perfom those services thereafter. </p>

      <p> The town made these (f 11v) and numerous other elaborate preparations for the expected
       visit by Elizabeth I, but in spite of long-held local belief to the contrary, there is no
       evidence in the records that her visit ever actually happened. Her progress into Suffolk and
       Norfolk during August 1578 did take her, in turn, to Long Melford, Bury St Edmunds, Hawsted,
       Euston, and Hengrave. She then made her way through Norfolk, staying at Swaffam, Kenninghall
       (with a side trip to Redgrave, Suffolk), Bracon Ash, Norwich, Kimberley, Woodrising,
       Thetford, and again to Hengrave, Suffolk. She then progressed on into Cambridge. In each
       place she stayed in the palatial residences of important members of the gentry, whose
       entertainments staged on her behalf are richly detailed in numerous contemporary sources,
       including those by Thomas Churchyard. In no place were performances more lavishly staged or
       cleverly conceived than in Norwich between 15 and 22 August (see David Galloway (ed),
        <title>Norwich 1540-1642</title> REED (Toronto, Buffalo, and London, 1984), pp 292–340).
       According to John Nichols, a year later, on 22–6 August 1579, the Queen spent four nights in
       Ipswich, having sailed up the Orwell from Essex. But once again local records offer no
       evidence confirming what Nichols, with some detail, claimed. Diarmaid MacCulloch (as reported
       by John Webb) offers factual reasons why the visit was not likely to have occurred, for
       example, the plague in Ipswich and the presence of the Queen's French suitor, the Duke of
       Anjou, at Greenwich during that time (Webb, <title>Town Finances</title>, p 46, n 4). </p>

      <p> The entry concerning Strange's players on f [5] is the third payment made in the account.
       Ferdinando Stanley (<hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1559–94) was thirteen Baron Strange (of Knokyn)
       from 1572, with seat at Stanley House, Chester, Cheshire. See <ref

      <p> 'Lord Vasse,' patron of the bearward on f [5v], is possibly William Vesey (d. 1577), lord
       of Cockerells Hall Manor, Buxhall, Suffolk, owner of the Manor of Hintlesham Priory, Suffolk,
       and lord of Wix Manor and Abbey, in Essex. </p>

      <p> Following the payment to Vassey's bearward on f [5v], the next dated entry twelve payments
       later is for 12 April.</p>

      <p> Guild Day, identified as 'The Guild' on f [6], was the annual feast days of the Corpus
       Christi/Merchants Guild that was held during the summer on days that changed through the
       decades. The Guild Day (or the guild) included a dinner, ceremonies, music, and other kinds
       of performance. In 1574–5 the burgesses ordered the day to be permanently changed to the
       'Sunday se'nnight next, after Midsummer-day,' though even that date proved subject to change,
       given the circumstances (Fitch, ' Corpus Christi Guild,' p 158).</p>

      <p> Charles Howard (1536–1624) was second Baron Howard of Effingham from 1573, with a
       residence at Effingham, Surrey. See <ref

      <p> John Kinge (f [6v]), scrivener and schoolmaster, possessed the ability both to make
       pageants and to stage events that involved pageants. In 1578 the town paid him for both those
       tasks on Guild Day and in its preparations for an expected visit by the Queen. In 1579 he
       again supplied 'the pageant' for Guild Day and for the annual commemoration of the Queen's
       Coronation, and in 1579 he made a ship pageant 'with certen convenynt speches therein.' He
       appears in the records a final time in 1584. Between 1578 and 1584, Kinge clearly was the
       town's central figure in the mounting of civic shows. See Stokes, 'Waits,' pp 22–4). </p>

      <p> John Kinge (f [6v]), scrivener and schoolmaster, possessed the ability both to make
       pageants and to stage events that involved pageants. In 1578 the town paid him for both those
       tasks on Guild Day and in its preparations for an expected visit by the Queen. In 1579 he
       again supplied 'the pageant' for Guild Day and for the annual commemoration of the Queen's
       Coronation, and in 1579 he made a ship pageant 'with certen convenynt speches therein.' He
       appears in the records a final time in 1584. Between 1578 and 1584, Kinge clearly was the
       town's central figure in the mounting of civic shows. SeeStokes, 'Waits,' pp 22–4). </p>

      <p> The 'quenes players being the children' (f [4]) refers to the boys' troupe patronized by
       Elizabeth I (1533-1602/3). The Children of the Chapel was a company of boys first formed in
       its certain Tudor iteration in 1501, patronize successively by Tudor monarchs through
       Elizabeth I, and thereafter with a revised name by the Stuarts. The company performed both
       musically and in drama, mainly for the Court until <hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1585. Thereafter
       through 1592 it performed both provincially and in the commercial theatres of London. Many of
       the boys had been impressed (because of their talent) from choral schools around the kingdom
       - a process not always appreciated by the schools, who saw it as the poaching of their best
       talent. The boys wore brightly coloured gowns, coats, and bonnets. Court records show that
       they enjoyed considerable financial support for their sustenance, educations, and the
       complexities of their travels to perform. See Chambers, <title>Elizabethan Stage</title>, vol
       2, pp 23–61). </p>

      <p> The three payments on f [3v] have been bracketed together, with the total for the three
       entered in the columns at the right. John Bettes was master of the company of waits that
       served in Ipswich for twenty years, between 1587 and 1607. The chamberlains' account for
       1601–2 identifies the variously spelled John Grenlef senior as being responsible for pressed
       soldiers (possibly former prisoners). He received 10s for conducting the soldiers to Snape,
       and 9s for supplying shoes for six of them. Both he and his son, John Grenleaf jr (so
       spelled) were tasked with responsibility for the soldiers. At a supper for nine of them, the
       younger Greenleaf was also reimbursed for his own supper C/3/3/2/34,unnumbered addendum (see
       also Webb, <title>Town Finances</title>, p 145). </p>

      <p> John Cressey, alias Minter, was the town drummer between 1587 and 1604–5 (the last time he
       appears in the records). The city routinely financed his annual wages, his livery, and his
       repairs to drums. In 1594–5 it also paid him for mending the civic ensigne using levant,
       white taffeta, and black silk. In 1608–9 the city paid one Richard Minter for two days'
       service with his drum. </p>

      <p> William Buckenham (f [7]) was presumably a tailor in that he routinely supplied blue cloth
       and made livery coats for the Ipswich waits between 1585 (when he was referred to as William
       Buckrome) and 1593–4. Mistress Buckenham, perhaps his wife, conducted the transaction in
       1589–90. Between 1607–8 and 1619–20 Henry Buckenham, perhaps their son, made three similar
       payments.</p>

      <p> Henry Radcliffe (1533-93) was ninth earl of Sussex (f [8v]) from 9 June 1583 with
       residence at New Hall, Essex. See <ref

      <p> John Bettes (f [4]) was master of a company of musicians who served as the waits of
       Ipswich between 1587–8 and 1607. Their initial hiring coincides with the city's celebration
       of Coronation Day after its three-year absence from the records and the troupe received
       payment 'for "ther servis done one the Quens Daye,' as did one Grenelefe and the drummer John
       Mynter. Raffe Owenden appears to have been fellow master of Bettes' company, if, as is most
       likely, he is the Rauff Oldham so described in 1590, 1591, and 1592–3, 1593–4,1594–5, and
       1596–7. In 1595 Bettes and Oldham were jointly granted a licence freely to go 'beyonde the
       seas this som<ex>m</ex>er next.'</p>

      <p> Elizabeth Tudor (f [5] 1533–1602/3) was crowned Elizabeth I on 15 January 1558/9. See <ref
        target="https://library2.utm.utoronto.ca/otra/reed/node/315890"
       ><title>P&amp;P</title></ref>.</p>

      <p> John Cressey, alias Minter, was the town drummer between 1587 and 1604–5 (the last time he
       appears in the records). The city routinely financed his annual wages, his livery, and his
       repairs to drums. In 1594–5 it also paid him for mending the civic ensigne using levant,
       white taffeta, and black silk. In 1608–9 the city paid one Richard Minter for two days'
       service with his drum.</p>

      <p> Henry Radcliffe (1533–93) was ninth earl of Sussex from 9 June 1583, with residence at New
       Hall, Essex. See <ref target="https://library2.utm.utoronto.ca/otra/reed/node/316278"
         ><title>P&amp;P</title></ref>.</p>

      <p> During this period, Coronation Day (f [7v]) remained as the primary annual civic spectacle
       (following the earlier demise of Corpus Christi) that was sponsored by the guild. Occasional
       payments (such as the building of stages and pageants) indicate that the event
       characteristically included mimetic elements. Triumphs, which begin to appear in the accounts
       in the wake of the victory over the Spanish Armada, appear to have included patriotic
       militaristic enactments, given the purchases of gunpowder. That is, the celebration would
       have had elements of 'story.' The use of gunpowder also occurred on Coronation Day, as the
       payment on f [8] shows. </p>

       Sangaye. If so, Lord Sangaye may have been Thomas Sankey (d. 1592), lord of Sankey Hall,
       Cheshire, who had been granted the lordship of Sankey Hall and other lands in Warrington and
       Sankey by Robert Dudley, lord of Warrington (of which Sankey formed part).</p>

      <p>Except for three years (see below), Minters of one stripe or another controlled
       officially-sponsored drumming in Ipswich between 1576 and 1634. John Minter and John Cressey
       alias Minter (likely the same person) appear in town records as drummers twenty-two times
       between 1576-7 and 1604-5. A third, seeming member of the family, John Cressey alias Minter
       the younger, appears once under that name, in 1586, when he was imprest into the king's
       service as a drummer. A fourth person, Richard Minter, is recorded as the town's drummer
       between 1580-1 and 1633-4, overlapping with John Minter's service. One wonders (given this
       apparent fifty-year career) if Richard Minter was actually father and son, both named
       Richard. Payments indicate that the town's Great Court routinely paid for their livery coats;
       for their repairing of drums, ensigns and other gear; for their service as drummers on the
       Queen's Coronation Day; for the Queen's visit in 1571; and for drumming on other civic
       occasions. John Minter was described in 1571 as being impoverished, but the antiquarian John
       Wodderspoon described him as 'an addition to the harmony of the town (<ex>Memorials</ex>, p
       183). A second drummer, Richard Minter, appears in the records nine times between 1580-1 and
       1590-1, invariably for his services at musters and other military events. His relationship to
       John Minter is unclear, but the records begin to refer to John as John Cressey alias Minter
       after Richard Minter begins to appear. A few other drummers appear throughout the
       Elizabethan, Jacobean and Caroline records of Ipswich: Thomas Fraunces for drumming and John
       Cooke for a drum case in 1559-60; Young Braine at the going forth in 1562-3, and William
       Braine (likely the same person) for two days' drumming in 1579-80; Peter Moone for drum
       sticks and heads in 1571-2, and John Meller for a drum head and case in 1573-4. Otherwise,
       John Minter controlled civic drumming, receiving his first warrant from the Great Court in
       1576-7 and the first funding of his livery in 1588-9. </p>

      <p>Robert Devereux (1565–1600/1) (f [7]) was nineteenth earl of Essex from 1576, with seat at
       Cassiobury House, near Watford, Hertfordshire. See <ref

      <p>William Buckenham (f [7v]) was presumably a tailor in that he supplied blue cloth and made
       livery coats for the Ipswich waits between 1585 (when he was referred to as William
       Buckrome)and 1593–4. Mistress Buckenham, perhaps his wife, conducted the transaction in
       1589–90. Between 1607–8 and 1619–20, Henry Buckenham, perhaps their son, made three similar
       payments. Four other individuals received payments for the same kinds of service to the waits
       through the years between 1607–8 and 1629–30 (Mr Warde, Thomas Ives, Edward Page, and Mr
       Cooper). Sometimes, rather than paying a tailor, the town simply gave the money to the waits
       leaving them to contract with the tailor. In those instances, the civic accounts obviously
       mention no tailor by name. The town provided money for the waits' livery a first recorded
       time in 1538 (the earliest surviving civic account)and for a final time in 1635–6. The town
       designated the treasurer as the officer responsible for funding the livery of the waits (see
       C/4/3/1/4 in 1608), while the chamberlain disbursed the waits' annual stipends and the
       rewards for their perfomances. The <rs ref="eats:414480" type="Collective_Office"
        >treasurer</rs> also paid for the livery of the drummer, sergeants, and beadle.</p>

       does appear that they were not being impressed but were rather going of their own volition
       for their own reasons. Waits often travelled within the kingdom during the summer and on
       holidays, usually having been hired for an occasion by a great lord (see, for example, the
       talented and much-traveled Grantham waits (Stokes, <title>Lincolnshire</title>, vol 2, pp
       448–9). However, evidence of travel overseas by waits is more unusual. Another East Anglian
       company, several of the waits of Norwich, accompanied Sir Francis Drake on his expedition in
       1589 to destroy Spanish ships that had sought shelter in the Bay of Biscay, and to undertake
       other missions. As opposed to the Ipswich waits, however, the waits of Norwich had been
       impressed and during the campaign three of them would lose their lives (see David Galloway,
        <title>Norwich</title>, REED (Toronto, Buffalo, and London, 1984), pp 395–6). </p>

      <p> John Bettes (f 19v) was master of a company of musicians who served as the waits of
       Ipswich between 1587–8 and 1607. Rauffe Oldham is identified as fellow master of Bettes'
       company in 1590, 1591, 1592–3, 1593–4, 1594–5, and 1596–7. In 1595 Bettes and Oldham were
       jointly granted a license freely to go 'beyonde the seas this som<ex>m</ex>er next.'</p>

      <p> John Cressey, alias Minter, (f 20) was the town drummer between 1587 and 1604–5 (the last
       time he appears in the records). The city routinely financed his annual wages, his livery,
       and his repairs to drums. In 1594–5 it also paid him for mending the civic ensigne using
       levant, white taffeta, and black silk. In 1608–9 the city paid one Richard Minter for two
       days' service with his drum.</p>

      <p> John Cressey, alias Minter, was the town drummer between 1587 and 1604–5 (the last time he

       white taffeta, and black silk. In 1608–9 the city paid one Richard Minter for two days'
       service with his drum.</p>

       white taffeta, and black silk. In 1608–9 the city paid one Richard Minter for two days'

      <p> Anne of Denmark (f [5]; 1574– 1618/19) was crowned queen of England on 25 July 1603. See
        <ref target="https://library2.utm.utoronto.ca/otra/reed/node/315847"
        ><title>P&amp;P</title></ref>.</p>

      <p> John Garland (f [6]; d. 1624) had been a member of the Queen's Men from 1583, apparently
       until the queen's death in 1603. He then served in the company of the Duke of Lennox and by
       1610, as this payment shows, was serving the future Prince Charles, the Duke of York. Joseph
       Tailour (Taylor) was likely the person of that name who was baptised at St Andrew by the
       Wardrobe in Blackfriars on 6 February 1585/6, and who was a resident of Southwark for much of
       his life. He first turned up as a player in 1610, and must have joined the Duke of York's
       troupe only recently before this payment was made to him and Garland. He joined the troupe of
       Lady Elizabeth when it formed in 1611, so his stay with his original company, the Duke of
       York's, had been brief; however, he again joined the Duke of York's company (now known as
       Prince Charles' Men) in March 1616. From 1619 through 1642 he 'was one of the most prominent
       members of the King's company,' likely replacing Richard Burbage when he died. Taylor clearly
       became a distinguished theatre man, mentioned as a player in the First Folio, and in
       innumerable legal and financial documents; as yeoman of the Revels; as a shareholder in the
       Globe and Blackfriars theatres; and as a peerless actor in many of the most important plays
       of the period. When he died, he was buried at Richmond on 4 November 1652. See Edwin
       Nungezer, <title>A Dictionary of Actors</title> (New Haven, 1929; rpt 1968), 146–7, 366–72;
       Bentley, <title>Jacobean and Caroline Stage</title>, vol 1, pp 198, 211 (John Garland); vol
       2, pp 590-8 (Joseph Taylor).</p>

      <p> Charles Stuart (1600–48/9) was seventh duke of York from 6 January 1604/5 to 27 March
       1625. See <ref target="https://library2.utm.utoronto.ca/otra/reed/node/315885"

      <p> The nature of the show is uncertain from the entry. The <rs ref="eats:369522"
        type="Place_PA_Settlement">town</rs> drummer played his drum at musters and at 'the shewe of
       bowe and pike' (1633–4). But he also drummed at spectacles staged at civic celebrations and
       on guild days. For example, the order to pay his wages in 1599–1600 says that he was paid in
       that year to drum 'at all tymes when Nede require.' In that same account, the town also paid
       someone for 'makinge of the stage on the Queens day.' However, in 1614–15 the reference to
       'the shewe' clearly refers to a specific presentational event but fails to provide context,
       military or otherwise. </p>

      <p> Symond Myndes (or Symon Minds, f 248) first appears in the records in 1609 as a member of
       Thomas Salter's company of waits. He continued as a member of that troupe in 1613 when Thomas
       Burrage replaced Salter as the troupe's master. In 1616–17 Myndes was discharged as a member
       of the waits for unlawfully begetting two children, but he had been reinstated by the
       following year when the town paid for his livery coat, describing him as one of the

      <p> William Perry was manager of the King's Revels when it visited Norwich on 27 February
       1613, and he was mentioned in a licence given to the company on 27 February 1615. The troupe
       would visit Norwich on 17 July of that same year. Although the licence would be withdrawn
       from the company by the Master of the Revels, Sir Henry Herbert,the earl of Pembroke in 1616,
       the company was recorded in provincial revels until 1617. Perry was then a patentee of the
       Queen's Revels when it visited Norwich in 1618. Following the queen's death in 1619 the
       troupe became known as the Children of the Revels to the late Queen Anne; it was apparently
       disbanded by September 1619. On 18 September 1619 Perry 'received a commission to organize a
       group of players under the title of "His Majesty's servants of the city of York".' On 10
       November 1619 Perry became co-manager of the Red Bull company and remained with them until
       1641. During those years he was named in numerous provincial performance records. See, for
       example, David Galloway (ed), <title>Norwich 1540–1642</title> REED (Toronto, Buffalo, and
       London, 1984), pp 143, 151, 157 (called William Percy in the record), 171–2, 175, 210–11,
       213–14, 223, 363–4, and also Edwin Nungezer, <title>A Dictionary of Actors</title> (New
       Haven, 1929; rpt 1968), p 278. </p>

      <p> Thomas Burrage (f [5]) first appears in the Ipswich records in 1609 as one of six
       musicians serving as the town's waits in a company whose master was Thomas Salter. By 1613
       Burrage had replaced Salter (who disappears from the records) as master of the company, which
       now had five musicians and a singing boy. Burrage held that position until 1637, when the
       waits stopped appearing in the records. Entries in the records through the years also
       indicate that Burrage's company had permission to travel to perform whenever they had a
       licence from the town to do so. Burrage died in early 1669.</p>

      <p> This visit involved an invitation by the officials of Ipswich to the townsmen of
       Colchester to attend a meeting to render an account concerning a Mr Harwick's gift. This page
       of the Chamberlains' Account records payments for provisions provided to the Colchester
       townsmen and musical entertainment by the waits at the meeting. Mr Harwick's identity is
       unclear, but his gift appears to have been large and to have been related to maritime matters
       concerning the port at Ipswich, since the portmen, among others, attended the meeting.</p>

      <p> Between 1611 and 1637 William Daniel (f [6]) was associated with various iterations of the
       king's performers, an itinerant troupe. Edwin Nungezer says that between 1611 and 1623 'the
       King's Players,' led by him [Daniels], performed several times at Canterbury but Bentley
       disagrees, saying that Daniels was probably never connected with the King's company'
        (<title>A Dictionary of Actors</title> (New Haven, 1929); Bentley, <title>Jacobean
        Stage</title>, vol 2, p 111). The King's Revels, with which he was subsquently associated,
       may have been the same company. On 28 November 1634 Daniel led a group of well more than five
       other actors who received a license to perform as 'the King's Revels.' In the three years
       between 1634–5 and 1636–7 this group is recorded at Coventry, Norwich, and Gloucester, in
       addition to Ipswich. See David Galloway (ed), <title>Norwich 1540–1642</title> REED (Toronto,
       Buffalo, and London, 1984), 176, 220–1, 363–4; R.W. Ingram (ed), <title>Coventry</title> REED

      <p> Between 1611 and 1637 William Daniel (f [6]) was associated with various iterations of the
       king's performers, an itinerant troupe. Edwin Nungezer says that between 1611 and 1623 'the
       King's Players,' led by him [Daniels], performed several times at Canterbury but Bentley
       disagrees, saying that Daniels was probably never connected with the King's company'
        (<title>A Dictionary of Actors</title> (New Haven, 1929); Bentley, <title>Jacobean
        Stage</title>, vol 2, p 111). The King's Revels, with which he was subsquently associated,
       may have been the same company. On 28 November 1634 Daniel led a group of well more than five
       other actors who received a license to perform as 'the King's Revels.' In the three years
       between 1634–5 and 1636–7 this group is recorded at Coventry, Norwich, and Gloucester, in
       addition to Ipswich. See David Galloway (ed), <title>Norwich 1540–1642</title> REED (Toronto,
       Buffalo, and London, 1984), 176, 220–1, 363–4; R.W. Ingram (ed), <title>Coventry</title> REED

      <p> The parish register of St Anne, Blackfriars, records the burial on 21 March 1579/80 of
       'Willliam, fool to my Lady Jerningham,' who obviously had died before Lady Frances made her
       will (John Southerden Burn, <title>Registrum Ecclesiae Parochialis: The History of Parish
        Registers in England</title>, 2nd ed (London, 1872), 108). So, over the course of time she
       had at least three fools. The odd assortment of facts surrounding these entries defies simple
       and immediate conclusions. Whether they were merely 'innocents' (persons with cognitive
       disabilities) or performers is equally difficult to ascertain. However, John Southworth has
       shown that a fool could be both (<title>Fools and Jesters at the English Court</title>
       (Stroud, 1998), 105). Is Joane, as a female fool, a rarity? While female fools rarely appear
       in provincial records, a number of them do appear in court records, which show them taking
       part in performances at court, often in collaboration with a male fool, as happened at the
       court of Mary Tudor. Why did Lady Frances Jerningham in particular have so many fools? The
       ladies of Mary Tudor's court, like the queen herself, expressed great compassion and
       affection for female fools, bestowing great favours upon them (Southworth, <title>Fools and
        Jesters</title>, pp 100–6). Frances Jerningham would have experienced that court. She
       appears to have inherited Joane from her husband's care, and treated all three of her fools
       as servants of her household, who must (she was determined to ensure) be treated well after
       her death. </p>

      <p> Concerning the house and master being referred to on f 61, Sir Thomas Kitson (1485–1540)
       had a house that included a chapel in London on Milk Street. One assumes that the master in
       these accounts, his son Sir Thomas Kitson, continued the Kitson ownership of that house.</p>

      <p> All the payments from the one on f 61v through the one on f 62 to the musicians of Swan
       Alley were made in London.</p>

      <p> In June (on f 45), Kitson's scribe also paid 3s to hire 'a man on mydsom<ex>er</ex> night
        w<ex>i</ex>th a corsellett to attend vppon my Lord maior,' and 2d for 'bowes' which could be
       anything from musical instruments to ribbons that were part of livery.</p>

      <p> My lord of Essex, whose players were paid on f 78v, was Walter Devereux (1539–76),
       eighteenth earl of Essex from 4 May 1572, with residences at Lamphey, Pembrokeshire, and
       Chartley, Staffordshire. See <ref

      <p> Concerning Barrowe on f 135v, Wasson identifies him as being 'the family physician,
       residing in Bury' (<title>Plays and Players</title>, p 166). </p>

      <p> On the same f 135v, My lord of Leicester was Robert Dudley (1532 or 1533–88), fourteenth
       earl of Leicester from 29 September 1564, with seats at Kenilworth, Warwickshire, and
       Wanstead, Essex. </p>

      <p> Thomas Radcliffe (1526/7-83) was Lord FitzWalter from 27 November 1542 and eighth earl of
       Sussex from 17 February 1556/7, with residences at New Hall and Woodham Walther, Essex. See
        <ref target="https://library2.utm.utoronto.ca/otra/reed/node/316275">P&amp;P</ref>.</p>

      <p> This reward on f 135v by Lady Kitson 'to certayne harvest fookes,' seems likely to have
       been given following their enacting of a customary end-of-harvest celebration of some kind.
       The lack of further detail in the accounts leaves the nature of the activity opaque. </p>

      <p> Waldon (on f 238) is likely Walton, a place ten miles southeast of Ipswich, by the sea
       near Felixstowe. During the period of these accounts the manor of Walton was held by the
       Brotherton and Howard families after Bigode, dukes and earls of Norfolk. The manor then
       encompassed most of Walton and Felixstowe. Walton had began its ancient life as an important
       Roman and medieval port and an inseparable part of Felixstowe, but because of the encroaching
       sea, it is now a modest village (Birch, <title>Ancient Sites</title>, pp 394–6). The specific
       nature of the instruments being conveyed, and the reason for carrying them to Walton is
       uncertain from the record.</p>

      <p> In a later letter written to Sir Dudley Carleton on 22 December 1621 (TNA: SP 14/124, f
       [1v]), Chamberlain appears to be referring to this same performance when he says: 'before the
       .K. came from Newmarket he went to S<ex>i</ex>r Iohn Crofts where he had great entertainment,
       and a maske made by his daughters, and some few dayes after they were likewise intertained‸
        <add place="above">and lodgest</add> at Newmarket.' Newmarket, in Lackford Hundred, lies
       between Bury St Edmunds and Cambridge.</p>

      <p> For an essential article on the likely performance itself in February 1619/20 and the
       certain performance in December 1621, both at the house of Sir John Crofts, see McGee,
       '"Visit of the Nine Goddesses",' pp 371–84. The article identifies the women who performed in
       the masque; describes the physical contexts, the structure, and the purpose of the masque;
       potential author(s) of the masque; biographical details of members of the Crofts circle; and
       a description of the manuscript containing the masque, which is now at Yale University. McGee
       also includes a modern edition of the masque on pp 380–4. For a discerning discussion of Ben
       Jonson's roles for women in masques at court, see Suzanne Gosset, '"Man-maid, begone": Women
       in Masques,' <title>English Literary Renaissance</title> 18 (1988): 96–113.</p>

      <p> The unconstrained activities of the women in the Croft circle in their producing of
       masques belie the countervailing views toward women and performance then circulating in the
       kingdom, and indeed the complexity of the King's own responses. As Chamberlain reports in a
       later paragraph of this letter: 'Our pulpits ring continually of the insolence and impudence
       of women, and to helpe the matter forward the players haue likewise taken them to taske, and
       so the ballades and ballad-singers, so that they can come no where but theyre eares tingle:
       and yf all this will not serue the King threatens to fall vpon theyre husbands parents or
       frends that haue or shold haue powre ouer them and make them pay for yt.' </p>

      <p> James Stuart (f [3v]; 1566–1625), was crowned James I of England on 25 July 1603. See <ref

      <p> A partially surviving date at the top of f [6v] says that this is the account of
         '<damage><gap unit="chars" extent="3"/></damage> Wilbeye,' chaplain and general receiver of
       the manor chantry of the Blessed Virgin Mary, 3 Henry IV until Michaelmas following, so for
       1401–2, preceded by the account for 1400–1. Thus it appears that this is a two-year account,
       and that the accounts likely ran from 29 September to 29 September.</p>

      <p> William de Willoughby (<hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1370–1409) was fifth Baron Eresby with
       residence at Spilsby, Lincolnshire (John Wasson (ed), <title>Collections 11</title>, Malone
       Society (Oxford, 1980/81), 227). </p>

      <p> It seems at least possible that the 'Wilbye' named in the heading of the account as being
       chaplain and general receiver of the chantry was a member of the Willoughby family. The
       minstrel(s) of the lords Willoughby performed often at Mettingham College beween 1401–2 and
       1451–2, and once in 1507. </p>

      <p> Middleton-Stewart identifies the Hall Yard, where the play was staged, as being 'part of
       the manorial complex which lay beyond the church' (<title>Records</title>, p 44, n 16). Since
       the play was held on St Thomas Day and dramatized St Thomas, it would appear that the guild
       of St Thomas figured large in its production. That guild was one of the larger of
       Mildenhall's nine religious guilds. It possessed considerable lands, had a messuage opposite
       the church, and received numerous bequests from parishioners of note (Middleton- Stewart,
        <title>Records</title>, pp xl, xliv, lxx, 85, 85n, 99, 120–1, 125).</p>

      <p> On ff 1, 4v, and 9v, the account names four wardens. In 1503–4 they are called church
       reeves but thereafter they are called churchwardens. </p>

      <p> Wasson says that these are the accounts of the wardens of the guild of St Thomas a Becket,
       but I see no evidence of that in the accounts (Wasson, <title>Plays and Players</title>, p
       190). The Record Office seems to be right in calling them the <rs ref="eats:3576"
        type="Collective_Office">churchwardens'</rs> accounts of the parish of St Mary and St
       Andrew, though Mildenhall did have six major religious guilds: Corpus Christi, Great Guild of
       Trinity and St John Baptist, St Mary, St James, Blessed Trinity, and St Thomas the Martyr
       (Birch, <title> Ancient Sites</title>, pp 272–3), plus three others. Holywell Row, Beck Row,
       and West Row were hamlets of Mildenhall. Each seems to have contributed to the town ale but
       they also mounted ales of their own, whose proceeds they also gave to the church of St Mary
       in Mildenhall. Three of these four parts of greater Mildenhall had its own medieval green
       (Birch, <title> Ancient Sites</title>, p 270). </p>

      <p> Thomas Skott (f 20), who lived in Westrow, served as churchwarden there in 1538 and upon

       (Middleton-Stewart, <title>Records</title>, pp xxxix, xlii, 78, and 92). In 1545 chantry
       priest William Reve designated Skott to be supervisor of his executors, and bequeathed to him
       his best surplice (Bury, Suffolk Record Office IC/500/1/10/81). Skott does not appear among
       the alumni of either Oxford or Cambridge (Middleton-Stewart, <title>Records</title>, p xlii).
       In his will, Skott designates his wife Agnes to distribute sums to the church on behalf of
       the poor and indigent (Middleton-Stewart, <title>Records</title>, p 78; for his will, see
       Bury, Suffolk Record Office, IC 500/2/19/). </p>

       the top of the page, one to the schoolmaster for a quarter ending 1 November 1633, but that
       is followed immediately by a payment for a quarter ending on Michaelmas 1633, so it does not
       appear that the entries are in order, though it is probably safe to say that the payment to
       players happened in the fall. The only dated entry on the page (near the bottom) is a payment

      <p> The Sudbury records confirm that visiting troupes performed in one of Sudbury's two Moot
       Halls (f 134). The older of them, the so-called Old Moot Hall, on Cross Street, dates from
       the fifteenth century. It still survives. The records, being from a later era, provide no
       evidence that it served as a performance venue. The second of the two, the New Moot Hall, aka
       Town Hall, dates from the mid-sixteenth century. Visiting troupes certainly performed there
       until at least 1606–7, at which point town officials forbade its further use for that
       purpose. This proper Moot Hall survived until 1841 when it was torn down and replaced with a
       new town hall. It survives only in drawings and water colour paintings (see W.W. Hodson, 'Old
       Moot Hall,' p 266.) </p>

       officials of the town were those actually choosing the knights of the shire and that the
       event included their horses and a meal. The people were being summoned, one might think, to
       attend upon the event (to take part in or witness the spectacle). But given the many entries
       on the next page of the account (p 281) involving soldiers and their training by knights, one

       <ab>To this court Thomas Page and Thomas Raynberd villein tenants of the manor, came in
         person<note type="marginal" place="margin_left">Fine, 40s</note> and in full court they
        surrendered into the hands of the lord by the hands of the steward one house called 'the
        town house' containing by estimation half an acre, and one piece of land held by villein
        tenure called 'the game place' lately of Thomas Berne, lying between the land now of Stephen
        Vincente on the south side, and the tenement and croft now of Richard Margery on the north
        side, and it abbuts on the hall green toward the east and contains half an acre, sixteen
        perches, and one foot, and one piece of land, a parcel of one acre and a half of a parcel of
        the cunnigar lying between the aforesaid land of Stephen Vincente on the south side,
        abbutting onto the aforesaid game place towards the east and onto the land held by villein
        tenure of the said Stephen towards the west and contains by estimation one rood of land
        which the same Thomas and Thomas together with Thomas Page, senior; Thomas Page, junior, son
        of John Page; and John Raynberd, now deceased, of late held for those and their heirs by
        concession of the lord at this court held on Monday, that is to say, 11 December in the
        twenty-fourth year of reign of the lady Elizabeth, late queen of England, etc, just as is
        completely clear in the roll of the court of the aforesaid manor, for the benefit and use of
        Thomas Rampley, gentleman; John Page, son of George Page, deceased; John Page, son of the
        aforesaid Thomas Page; Richard Raynberd, senior; Thomas Seaman, son of Thomas Seaman;
        William Raynberd, son of William Raynberd; William Complyn; John Vincent; Richard Page, son
        of Stephen Page; and Richard Parker; and their heirs. And because the court established here
        that the profits of the lands and aforesaid tenements with appurtenances from time to time
        inperpetuity will remain for the use of the inhabitants of this town, who in repairing the
        house have spent much, therefore the lord in continuation of ancient revenues [redituum] and
        services delivered by his steward to the same Thomas Rampley; John Page; John Page; Richard
        Raynberd, senior; Thomas Seaman; William Raynberd; William Complyn; John Vincent; Richard
        Page; and Richard Parker seisin regarding the aforesaid premises with appurtenances to be
        held by them and their heirs of the lord by authority (of the court) at the pleasure of the
        lord according to the customs of the manor aforesaid by rents and service of which formerly
        were owed and by right accustomed, with right reserved, etc. And they give to the lord of
        the fine. And were admitted therefore as tenants. And the aforesaid Thomas Rampley has done
        fealty to the lord.</ab>

        played a game called 'Summer-game' in the lord's hall, as in the (marginal) heading (<hi

      <p> Why the playing of the summer game in the lord's hall should generate a sizable fine is
       not clear, since in its traditional form the summer game was festive and non-controversial.
       One can only assume that Atte Forth either used this game for an unacceptable purpose, or
       entered the lord's close and hall without permission. Christopher Dyer argues that customs of
       this kind, because they involve processions and large gatherings of people, 'are directly
       relevant to the 1381 revolt because the first outbreaks in Essex and Kent took place in Whit
       week, 1-8 June, the normal time for summer games,' and for the holding of court leet sessions
       ('The rising of 1381 in Suffolk: Its Origins and Participants,' <title>Proceedings of the
        Suffolk Institute of Archaeology</title> 36.4 (1988), 281). Traditional festive forms
       certainly became political instruments much later during the sixteenth century but the
       immediate context of this particular incident in the late fourteenth century remains obscure.

      <p> Dymond says that in Sexten's original will, Critofte is identified as Sexten's cousin
       rather than his brother (Suffolk Archives, Bury: IC 500/1/20, f 249). Dymond has used the
       registered version of Sexten's will because, as he says, 'the original is damaged and
       incomplete' (<title>Three Entertainers </title>, p 5, n 11).</p>

      <p> Citing J.O. Halliwell-Phillips, <title>Dictionary of Archaic and Provincial Words</title>,

    <div>
     <p>By policy, REED does not systematically search royal records or include extracts from royal
      records in the main Records text. However, in the course of researching for the Suffolk
      collection, there have turned up several entries in royal records that provide significant
      information about performances in Suffolk, or elsewhere by Suffolk performers. Those records
      have been selected for inclusion in this appendix because they show Suffolk aristocracy
      involved in dramatic entertainment at an early date. These include performances by numerous
      entertainers before and at the nuptuals of Margaret, daughter of Edward I, at Ipswich in
      1296-7; guardrobe accounts of the custodian of the two princes, Thomas of Brotherton and
      Edmund of Woodstock, in 1311-12; a mimetically and musically informed hastiludium sponsored by
      the Black Prince at Bury St Edmunds in 1348; a reward at Bury St Edmunds to a minstrel in an
      inventory of the Black Prince in 1348; and a reward to a troupe of Suffolk players performing
      at court in 1512. </p>

        <p> According to Constance Bullock-Davies, Matilda Makejoy, who appears in the household
         accounts of both Edward I and Edward II, was a saltatrix or 'acrobatic dancer' She is
         listed among the minstrels receiving payments for their performances at this feast and on
         other occasions. Makejoy was not a 'royal domestic minstrel,' that is, a member of the
         household entertainers, though she was 'attached <gap reason="omitted"/> to the royal
         household for at least 14 years' (<title>Menstrellorum Multitudo: Minstrels at a Royal
          Feast</title> (Cardiff, 1978), 26, 55). As Bullock-Davies explains it, Matilda Makejoy's
         profession of 'acrobatic dancing girl' had ancient roots, dating at least to the time of
         Homer and Zenophon, and is traceable through the Middle Ages both in England and in Europe.
         While the assorted payments to Makejoy are unique in the records, a number of medieval
         manuscripts contain illustrations of female acrobatic dancers, including the biblical
         Salome, and other unidentified dancing girls (for some of the British examples, see BL: MS
         Harley 1527, f 29; BL: MS Cotton Domitian A2, f 7; BL: Royal MS E iv, f 58; and Bodl.: MS
         264 (Bullock-Davies, <title>Menstrellorum Multitudo</title>, pp 55-7)). The royal payroll
         edited and analyzed by Bullock-Davies in her book also identifies nine performers (male)
         and their patrons, who were women, including discussion of the specific skills and musical
         instruments favored in their household performers by these women patrons (Bullock-Davies,
          <title>Menstrellorum Multitudo</title>, pp 11, 67-173). </p>

        <p> The lavish wedding celebration of Elizabeth Planagenet in Ipswich between late December
         1296 and early January 1296/7 occurred between two military campaigns in Edward's war
         against the Scots. The first of the two campaigns had begun on 27 April 1296 and ended in
         late July of that year. The second campaign would begin in September 1297. Edward's
         itineraries to and from the conflicts took him the eastern length of England, from London
         to the expanses of Scotland, including considerable preparation time spent in Essex,
         Suffolk and Norfolk. Nearly all of the non-royal patrons named in this document lived in
         the eastern-most parts of England. The English exception was Sir Hugh de Cressingham
         (1264-11 September 1297), lord high treasurer of Scotland (for Edward I) from 1296, with a
         residence at Gressingham, Lancashire, plus at curacies in Norfolk and elsewhere. The one
         Scot, John Comyn (<hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1260-1308), was seventh earl of Buchan from
         1289, with residence at Buchan, Scotland. A defeated opponent of Robert the Bruce, he was
         now under the protection of Edward I. The patrons with East Anglian connections included
         Simon Fitz Richard, lord of Threxton, Norfolk, Dunmow, Essex, and Letheringham, Suffolk,
         with residence in Dunmow, Essex; William Marshal (1277-1314), lord of Hingham, Norfolk,
         first lord marshal from 1313, with residence at Denham, Suffolk; and Robert de Vere
         (1257-1331); sixth earl of Oxford from 16 February 1295/6, with seat at Hedingham Castle,
         Essex. Those patrons who lived farther north in the eastern reaches included Anthony Bek
          (<hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1245-1310/11), bishop of Durham from 9 July 1283, with residence
         at Durham Castle (also serving as the Durham Bishop's Palace); and Thomas de Moulton
         (1275/6-1313), first Baron Multon of Gilsand from 1307, with residence in Gilsland,
         Northumberland. Also present were Edward Plantagenet (Edward of Caernarfon) (1284-1327),
         fourth son of Edward I, prince of Wales from 1301, and King Edward II of England from
         1307), and, of course, Elizabeth Plantagenet (Elizabeth of Bohun, Elizabeth of Rhuddlan and
         countess of Hertford) (1282-1316). While this document includes no explicit references to
         the Scottish conflicts, the patrons there present, would seem, in their geographical
         distribution, to reflect the concerns of a monarch who was in the midst of not only the
         wedding celebration of his daughter, but of domestic wars past and looming. </p>

    <head>The Ceremony of the White Bull</head>
    <div>
     <p>The medieval abbey at Bury had a curious custom called the Ceremony of the White Bull, in
      which a wealthy married woman (or any other married woman who could afford it), who was unable
      to conceive a child, went in a large procession through the town, preceeded by a white bull.
      The procession traveled from and returned to the Abbey where there occurred a religious
      ceremony at the Shrine of St Edmund involving prayers that, with the intercession of St
      Edmund, gave the lady the ability to conceive. Descriptions of the custom show that it
      traveled west from the Great Churchyard onto Churchgate Street, then right (some six blocks
      later) onto Guildhall Street, then right (several blocks later) onto Abbeygate Street (once
      called Cook Row), which ends at the main gate of the abbey. The route took the procession
      through the two great market squares of the town combining spectacle and loud engagement by
      townspeople, and ending with a pious ceremony in the Abbey. The fame of the event attracted
      women (or their surrogates) from other European countries as well.</p>

     <p>The earliest surviving description of the event, by schoolmaster William Hawkins, dates from
      the seventeenth century. Hawkins served as curate of Hadleigh and schoolmaster of Hadleigh
      Grammar School from 1626 until 1637, when he died of the plague. In his <title>Corolla
       Varia</title> (a Latin compendium), the entirety of its chapter 26 involves discussion of
      ‘The Ceremony of the White Bull.’ Hawkins says therein that he is describing an undated court
      case in which witnesses brought forth three leases, respectively dated 1487, 1519, and 1533,
      as precedents for the practice of leasing the manor of Haberdon with the attendant
      responsibility of the leasee to keep or to find a white bull for use in the ceremony. Hawkins’
      description includes partial transcriptions of the leases from 1487 and 1519, and a complete
      transcription of the one from 1533. Of the three leases, only the one from 1533 is known to
      survive.</p>

     <p>According to Hawkins, the earliest of these three leases, the one made on 4 June 1487 at the
      order of the Sacrist John Swaffham, was written into a register of his that apparently no
      longer survives. Hawkins’ summary confirms only that the lease of Haberdon Manor to one Simon
      Lolepke was made on this date, and that in return Lolepeke was to provide a while bull for the
      ceremony.</p>

     <p>The second of the leases, also now lost, was made on 12 September 1519. Hawkins’ summary
      says little more than that the Sacrist John Eye had leased Haberdon, with responsibility for
      the white bull, to one Richard Mancrium of Haberdon, using language mirroring the lease of
      1487.</p>

     <p>The third of the leases, made on 28 April 1533, fortunately survives (TNA: PRO E 327/252).
      It was made not by a sacrist but by Abbot John Reeve of Melford, the thirty-third and final
      abbot of Bury St Edmunds (served 1514-38; ejected from the abbey in 1540) whose seal is
      affixed to the document. The lease was presented to the court by John Hill, an attorney of the
      King’s Bench (Martin Taylor, '10 Abbots of the Abbey of St Edmund,' <ref
       target="https://visit-burystedmunds.co.uk/blog/the-10-abbots-of-the-abbey-of-st-edmundsbury"
        ><title>Bury St Edmunds and Beyond</title></ref>, accessed 14 November 2024). It offers more
      detail about the ceremony than do the extracts in Hawkins from the two lost leases of 1487 and
      1519. The purpose of this court case appears to concern a dispute over who, at the time of the
      case, had the right to lease or own the Manor of Haberdon. The case had to have been brought
      sometime after 1533, at a time when the abbot, not a sacrist, awarded the lease. The parties
      appear to agree that the ceremony of the white bull had traditionally been a significant part
      of the land agreement, though the ceremony itself likely was no longer an operative customary
      event.</p>

         <ab type="indent">From the lord sacrist's agreement] Let witnesses come forth in the case
          of the bull. The first witness has appeared, an honourable and agreeable man, James
          Copinus, notary public, proctor in the ecclesiastical courts of the neighbouring
          jurisdictions. He produces an authentic register of the monastery of St Edmund, which at
          one time was assigned to the guardianship of the sacrist. Master Copinus reads clearly:
          'This indenture bears witness that John Swaffham, sacrist of the monastery of Bury St
          Edmunds, by the assent and will of the prior and the community of the same place, has
          handed over and leased to farm to Simon Lolepeke of the aforesaid Bury, yeoman, the manor
          called Haberdon in the aforesaid Bury, etc. to have, etc. for a term of seven years and
          revisited yearly after that. And the said Simon, his executors and assigns will find or
          will cause to be found one white bull every year of their term as often as it should
          happen that any gentle woman or any other women by devotion or vow made by themselves come
          to the shrine of the glorious king and martyr, St Edmund, to make offerings of the said
          white bull, &amp;c. In witness of which, the sacrist's seal is appended to one part,
          &amp;c. Given 4 June, in the second year of the reign of King Henry the seventh after the
          conquest of England.'</ab>

         <ab type="indent">The second witness, John Mallosius, attorney of the Common Pleas, actuary
          of the same incorporated town, or notary public, has appeared. He produces another
          register of the aforesaid monastery, and clearly reads: 'This indenture made 12 September
          in the eleventh year of the reign of King Henry VIII, between Master John Eye, sacrist of
          the monastery of Bury St Edmunds and Richard Skinner, husbandman of Bury aforesaid, bears
          witness that the aforesaid John Eye by assent, etc, has handed over and leased to farm to
          the aforesaid Richard Mancrium of Haberdon, etc, for a term of ten years, etc, and the
          said Richard will find one white bull as often as it should happen, etc, as before.'</ab>

         <ab type="indent">Lastly, another attorney of the King's Bench, John Montanus, in English
          'Hill,' not at all unlike the earlier attorney in great trustworthiness and maturity. This
          is the third witness, and he is a valuable one, both because he is a descendant and heir
          of the later renowned Hannibal from his daughter, and because he works with sealed
          tablets. For he produced an original instrument of the monastic chapter fortified with a
          seal: 'This indenture bears witness that we, John, by divine permission abbot of the
          monastery of Bury St Edmunds, by the assent and will of the prior and of the religious

        <p> An article in <title>Gentleman's Magazine</title>, by one D. H. describes the event in
         these terms: 'Whenever a married woman wished to be pregnant, this white bull, who enjoyed
         full ease and plenty in the fields of Habyrdon, never meanly yoked to the plough, no ever
         cruelly baited at the stake, was led in procession through the principal streets of the
         town, viz., Church Street, Guildhall Street, and Cook Row, of which the last led to the
         principal gate of the monastery, attended by all the monks singing, and a shouting crowd,
         the woman walking by him, and stroking his milk-white side and pendant dewlaps. The bull
         then being dismissed, the woman entered the church, and paid her vows at the altar of St.
         Edmund, kissing the stone, and entreating with tears the blessing of a child. This reminds
         one of the luperci among the Romans, who ran naked about the streets, and with thongs of
         goatskins struck women with child in order to give easy labour (Virg., "Æn," viii, 633),'

         had been accustomed of old time, at the shrine of the blessed King, Virgin, and Martyr, St.

    <head>Remembrances of pre-Reformation Drama, Custom and Ceremony in Long Melford</head>
    <div>
     <p>Before the Reformation, Long Melford (near Bury) had a flourishing tradition of local drama,
      customs, and religious ceremonials, many of those activities making use of Melford’s
      cathedral-like parish church and churchyard. When the Reformation brought the destruction of
      those traditional customs and ceremonials, Roger Martin, one of Melford’s most influential
      (and anti-Reformation) parishioners wrote a unique contempory description of them, hoping
      thereby to preserve them in the community’s historical memory.</p>

     <p>Sixteenth-century Long Melford was a small but significant market town in Babergh Hundred,
      lying along the principal Sudbury to Bury road three miles from Sudbury and twelve miles from
      Bury. Paradoxically, being an important manor of the Abbey of Bury St Edmunds furthered both
      Long Melford's industrial development and its pre-Reformation parish culture. As Mark Bailey
      has observed, like other successful textile towns in Suffolk, Long Melford flourished 'on the
      large manor of a major landlord' (increasing the tax base fattened the coffers of the
      landlord, and Long Melford ranked sixth in Suffolk in taxable wealth). The abbot's manor was
      an '800-acre desmene together with 600 acres of villein land' Bailey, <title>Medieval
       Suffolk</title> pp 33, 282, 300.) The abbot was granted a weekly market and fair on Thursdays
      at Long Melford in 1235 and the town had a nine-day annual fair from 1330 that ran from the
      vigil and day of Pentecost through the next seven days (Gibson, ‘Bury St Edmunds,’ p 79, n
      132). Its population grew from sixty-three (in 1086), to sixty-two taxpayers (1327), to 1,000
      persons (1524), to 1,150 persons (1603). It had a school by 1350, in which the chantry priest
      served as schoolmaster. In the 1460s Long Melford ranked fifth among Suffolk towns as a centre
      of cloth manufacturing, and by the 1520s it had more fullers than any other Suffolk town
      (Dymond Northeast, <title>History of Suffolk</title>, pp 52–3; Bailey, <title>Medieval
       Suffolk</title>, pp 249, 272–4; Goult, <title> West Suffolk</title>, np; Blackwood,
       <title>Tudor and Stuart Suffolk</title>, p 5).</p>

     <p>Long Melford's early parish identity was equally substantial. Its grand fifteenth century
      parish church of the Holy Trinity has been variously described as 'one of the finest parish
      churches in England,' 'a village cathedral,' and one of the two most famous churches in
      Suffolk; the 'enormous' glebe of the parish covered 251 acres of arable, meadow, pasture, and
      wood lands. The town had six guilds , including Corpus Christi, St Thomas, Blessed Virgin
      Mary, St Peter, Jesus, and Bachelors, four of whom left streamers or banner cloths in an
      inventory of 1541. A guildhall of Corpus Christi stood at what Goult says was Little St Mary's
      in Hall Street (Dymond and Northeast, <title>History of Suffolk</title>, p 55; Blackwood,
       <title>Tudor and Stuart Suffolk</title>, pp 62, 63-4; Bailey, <title>Medieval
      Suffolk</title>, p 15).</p>

     <p>Roger Martin or Martyn, esquire (1526-1615), who wrote this document, was a member of an
      ancient and influential family of clothiers in Long Melford. He deeply opposed the spoliation
      of his parish church and the abolition of its traditional religious customs, ceremonies, and
      entertainments during the sixteenth-century protestant reform movement. For his efforts, he
      was several times fined, jailed, and otherwise punished as a recusant by the new ruling order.
      Eventually he wrote a unique recollection of pre-Reformation customs and services, as he had
      known them, used at Long Melford before they were destroyed. In the late sixteenth century,
      one of Martin’s descendents showed the description to then Long Melford Rector, Dr. Nathaniel
      Bisbie, who ordered it transcribed by Melford schoolmaster Jonathan Moor. In 1825, the then
      owner of Moor’s transcription permitted it to be published by J. P. Neale. Since then, both
      Martyn’s original and Moor’s transcription have disappeared, making Neale’s published
      transcription the earliest surviving version. Neale’s transcription has since been
      republished, by at least five others.</p>

     <p>The Neale version of Martyn’s description is also published, with varying degrees of
      fidelity, in <title>The Gentlemen’s Magazine</title> 100 (1830), 206-7; Sir William Parker,
       <title>History of Long Melford</title> (London, 1873), 72-3.; E. L. Conder, <title>Church of

          the Church Gate, went westward, and they with the Blessed Sacrament, went eastward: and
          when the procession came against the door of <rs ref="eats:464448" type="Person_Male">Mr.

           type="Entertainer_Type">singing</rs>, approached at the east end of our Ladie's Chappel,
          at which time a Boy, with a thing in his hand, pointed to it, signifying a Prophet, as I
          think, sang, standing upon the Tyrret that is on the said Mr. Clopton's Ile doore,
           <ex>Ecce Rex tuus, venit, &amp;c.</ex>; and then all did kneel down, and then, rising up,
          went and met the Sacrament, and so then, went singing together, into the Church, and
          coming near the Porch, a Boy, or one of the <rs ref="eats:9186" type="Collective_Clergy"

        <p> It is thought that the author of this reminiscence of pre-Reformation religious
         practices in Long Melford was Roger Martin, esq. (<hi rend="italic">c </hi>1526-1615), a
         member of a prominent family of clothiers in Long Melford, and an ardent opponent of the
         Reformation (Neale, <title>Views</title>, p 70). If Neale is right, Martin would have been
         seventeen years old at the onset of the Reformation, and served as a Long Melford
         churchwarden during the reign of Mary (1554-8), during the brief restoration of Catholic
         practices. His reminiscence would, therefore, likely have been written by Martin between
         1554 and his death in 1615.</p>

        <p> Neale's book is a compendium of descriptions of architecturally interesting churches and
         church furniture. Each description of a church is paged separately. The page numbers here
         (13-14) are those within the description of Long Melford's church of the Holy Trinity. On
         the Martins (or Martyns) and other important clothier families in Long Melford, see Gail
         McMurry Gibson, in 'Long Melford Church, Suffolk: Some Suggestions for the Study of Visual
         Artifacts and Medieval Drama,' <title>Research Opportunities in Renaissance Drama</title>
