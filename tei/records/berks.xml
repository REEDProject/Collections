                                        contemporaries grew. Founded in 1976, REED has worked since
                                        then to locate, transcribe, and edit historical documents
                                        containing evidence of drama, secular music, and other
                                        communal entertainment and ceremony from the Middle Ages
                                        until 1642, when the Puritans closed the London
                                        theatres.</p>

                                                recipients of the new Major Editorial Grants from
                                                the Council that continued for many years under the
                                                Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of
                                                Canada, founded by an act of the Canadian parliament
                                                in 1977. By 1978 REED York was ready for
                                                publication, and three other civic records
                                                collections begun before the founding of REED
                                                (Chester, Coventry, and Norwich) were well on their
                                                way to publication. Our next task was to assign new
                                                research areas including what were to become county
                                                collections. It was that year that I began my first
                                                exploration of the records of Berkshire. This
                                                collection, then, has been underway for forty years.
                                                Much has happened over those forty years. Two of the
                                                major national record depositories, the Public
                                                Record Office in London and the library of the
                                                British Museum, have moved and computerized their
                                                operations. The PRO has moved to Kew and become The
                                                National Archives and the library of the British
                                                Museum has become the very handsome and functional
                                                British Library on Euston Road. The Wiltshire Record
                                                Office, where the records of the diocese of
                                                Salisbury are stored, has moved from Trowbridge to
                                                Chippenham and become the Wiltshire and Swindon
                                                Archives, part of the Wiltshire and Swindon History
                                                Centre. The Berkshire Record Office, the major
                                                source for the records in this collection, has
                                                retained its name but has moved twice since I began
                                                my work. I remember working in the basement of a
                                                building in the Forbury in Reading (once the
                                                courtyard of Reading Abbey, which is of major
                                                importance to the records of Reading) from 1978 to
                                                1981 when it moved to the Shire Hall on the M4
                                                motorway until 2000 when it moved to its present
                                                location on Coley Street in Reading. Five other
                                                depositories have provided records for this
                                                collection – the Bodleian Libraries, University of
                                                Oxford; Exeter College Archives, Oxford; the
                                                Oxfordshire History Centre, Oxford; the Record
                                                Office of Leicestershire, Leicester, and Rutland in
                                                Leicester; and St George’s Chapel Archives and
                                                Chapter Library in Windsor. I wish to thank all of
                                                these repositories for their permission to publish
                                                excerpts from their manuscripts in this
                                                collection.</p>
                                        <p>Over the years the Berkshire project has been supported
                                                through the generous grants to REED from first the
                                                Canada Council, then SSHRC, the American National
                                                Endowment for the Humanities (since 1979), and the
                                                Jackman Foundation of Toronto (since 1989) through
                                                our great friend Father Edward Jackman, the
                                                University of Toronto and Victoria University. SSHRC
                                                has also supported aspects of the work on this
                                                collection through three personal grants (1991–2000)
                                                jointly to myself and my friend and colleague,
                                                Sally-Beth MacLean, and a travel grant to me in
                                                1992. I received five travel grants from the
                                                University of Toronto (1988–97) and fourteen
                                                research and travel grants from Victoria University
                                                in the University of Toronto (1983–2016). My
                                                heartfelt thanks go to all of these funders. These
                                                records could not have been completed without their
                                                help.</p>
                                        <p>Many archivists have provided help and advice over the
                                                decades. I cannot now remember all their names but I
                                                remember the cheerful helpfulness many provided to a
                                                neophyte researcher in this kind of material in the
                                                early years. I particularly want to thank Peter
                                                Durrant of the Berkshire Record Office and Steven
                                                Hobbs of the Wiltshire and Swindon Archives who have
                                                helped in recent years. Juliet Chadwick, the
                                                sub-librarian of Exeter College, was particularly
                                                helpful in providing the early record of parish
                                                drama in West Wittenham (now Long Wittenham). A minor crisis near the end
                                                of the process came about when no one could find the
                                                original documents of the parish of St Laurence in
                                                Appleton for checking. The combined efforts of Roger
                                                Mitty, churchwarden, and Fiona Davis, archivist, of
                                                the parish with the help of Jeremy Taylor and Ellie
                                                Thorne of the BRO staff established that the
                                                documents had, indeed, been deposited in the Record
                                                Office after I read them in the parish in 1979.</p>
                                        <p>During the years of my research I have been grateful for
                                                the help and support of my colleagues in history who
                                                have shown me the way through the complexities of
                                                sixteenth-century English religious and political
                                                history and how it affected Berkshire. I am
                                                particularly grateful to Professor John Craig of
                                                Simon Fraser University and Professor Robert Tittler
                                                of Concordia University.</p>
                                        <p>I have not kept this research to myself. Between 1979 and
                                                2009 I have published fourteen articles and book
                                                chapters (including an article co-authored by
                                                Sally-Beth MacLean), as well as given many papers
                                                using this material, especially the rich records of
                                                St Laurence, Reading. It is good to finally have all
                                                the Berkshire records together for others to use. </p>
                                        <p>There have been many people in the REED office over the
                                                years who have had a hand in the collection and
                                                editing of these records. In the very early days the
                                                bibliographic work of my colleague Ian Lancashire
                                                provided the starting point for the search. Over the
                                                early decades Mary Blackstone, Miriam Skey, and
                                                Theodore De Welles added more resources to the list
                                                and Cameron Louis did the early paleographical
                                                checking and taught me about the many disagreements
                                                about the shape of a capital ‘a.’ Abigail Ann Young
                                                helped me with many of the translations from Latin,
                                                especially those used in my articles and book
                                                chapters. </p>
                                        <p>The complex final assembling of the material for online
                                                publication has been organized by Carolyn Black,
                                                REED’s project manager, who has also done some
                                                proof-reading and copy-editing with the help of
                                                Tanya Hagen who has also done the content checking
                                                and, most importantly, the final bibliographical
                                                check, assisted by Alexandra Atiya. Tanya's check
                                                discovered the second important fourteenth-century
                                                reference to parish playing in the register of of
                                                John Waltham, bishop of Salisbury (1388–95), that
                                                was not deposited in the Wiltshire and Swindon
                                                Archives until well after I began my research and
                                                was not made public until 1994. Patrick Gregory,
                                                Latinist and paleographer, is the author of the
                                                Latin glossary and co-author of the translations
                                                with Cai Henderson who also assisted him with much
                                                of the final paleographical checking. Janine Harper
                                                is the author of the English glossary. Kathy Chung
                                                has done the complex job of ‘entity tagging’ the
                                                edition to enable users to search these records, while website programmer and developer Jamie Norrish 
                                                offered valuable advice and expertise.
                                                Jonah Shallit, an undergraduate volunteer, has done
                                                the research for the map with the guidance of Byron
                                                Moldofsky, REED’s mapping expert. The majority of
                                                the on-site checking in England has been done by

                                                MacLean. My first grant from the Canada Council for
                                                the publication of the York records allowed me to
                                                engage Sally-Beth as part of the project in 1976. We
                                                have worked together all these decades and, since I
                                                also have had a full-time teaching and
                                                administrative career at the University of Toronto,
                                                it is Sally-Beth who has managed the project since

                                                amongst themselves, and then against the invading
                                                Danes. During the ninth century the county suffered

                                        <p>In the twenty-first century Berkshire still proudly
                                                called itself the ‘royal’ county. This appellation
                                                is drawn from the medieval past, when Windsor and
                                                Wallingford were major royal residences with
                                                extensive land holdings attached. There were no
                                                other great magnates in the county such as the
                                                Courtenays in Devon or the Percys and the Nevilles

                                        <p>The later years of the thirteenth century saw the
                                                emergence of the system of parliamentary
                                                representation from cities and boroughs to
                                                complement the representation of the knights of the
                                                shires in parliament. Berkshire was called to send
                                                two knights to the parliament of 1295. Reading and
                                                Wallingford also sent two members – representation
                                                they would maintain throughout the period covered by
                                                these records. Windsor and Newbury were called to
                                                send two representatives to the parliament of 1302,
                                                although Windsor had no representation after that
                                                until the late fifteenth century and Newbury was
                                                dropped entirely after the parliament of 1337.
                                                Abingdon did send a single representative to that
                                                parliament but did not again send a representative
                                                until it became a borough in 1558. The members who
                                                sat for Berkshire as knights of the shire and
                                                represented the towns, especially in the later

                                                gentry, making a close link between the county

                                                Windsor Castle and it was there he established the
                                                Order of the Garter and held the first ‘round table’
                                                as a showcase of chivalry. He engaged William of

                                                castle. Berkshire was also the site of one of the

                                        <p>During the later fourteenth century, despite the frequent
                                                levies for the king’s French wars, Berkshire was
                                                less caught up in national affairs. The Peasants’
                                                Revolt was fought elsewhere. Only at the turn of the
                                                fifteenth century did a royal palace in Berkshire
                                                again gain prominence. Henry IV and his family
                                                celebrated Christmas 1399 at Windsor, when the earls
                                                of Kent, Salisbury, and Huntingdon plotted ‘to falle

                                                king, who was able to escape to London while the

                                                Richard’s queen, who was then at Sonning, near
                                                Reading, and then marched north and west through the
                                                county through Wallingford, Abingdon, and Faringdon.
                                                The plot sputtered out in Cirencester. </p>

                                                the new king’s Beaufort half siblings, became
                                                constable of Wallingford Castle and steward of the
                                                honours of Wallingford and St Valery. This mark of
                                                royal favour added to the income brought to him
                                                through his marriage with Maud, daughter and coheir
                                                of Sir John Burghersh of Ewelme, Oxfordshire. His
                                                lands in Berkshire helped him establish a power base
                                                between the Chilterns and the Cotswolds. He was
                                                sheriff of Berkshire and Oxfordshire twice (1400–1,
                                                1403–4), and as one of the knights for Oxfordshire
                                                sat on many commissions dealing with Berkshire
                                                issues such as treason, Lollardy, and commissions of
                                                oyer and terminer. He was speaker of the House of
                                                Commons five times from 1407 to 1421. As a local
                                                landowner he joined the confraternity of the Holy
                                                Cross in St Helen’s Church, Abingdon. Chaucer thus
                                                became the first of the well-connected commoners who
                                                established themselves with the central government
                                                and received much of their income from land granted
                                                to them by the Crown in Berkshire. He died in 1434
                                                and left his estates to his only child, Alice, by

                                                west through Abingdon to cut off Henry VI and Queen
                                                Margaret advancing from the west. After the
                                                accession of Richard III there was a brief flurry of
                                                support from Berkshire gentry (including a member of
                                                the Norris family) in support of Henry of Richmond;
                                                this quickly subsided when Francis, Lord Lovell, one
                                                of Richard’s closest advisors, was made constable of

                                                further executions, this time of Protestants in

                                                brutally put down. Two weavers of Newbury and a
                                                shoemaker of Reading were arrested in November 1549
                                                for ‘machinating and compassing the king’s death’

                                                the 1549 risings were seemingly sparked by economic

                                        <p>Similar religious conservatism advanced the career of Sir
                                                Francis Englefield, another member of the Berkshire
                                                gentry whose fortunes were greatly enhanced by gifts
                                                from the Crown. Englefield is in the southern part
                                                of Berkshire in the valley of the Kennet west of
                                                Reading. Sir Francis’ grandfather, Sir Thomas, had
                                                been advisor to Henry VII and speaker of the Commons
                                                in 1497 and 1510. His father had been sheriff of
                                                Oxfordshire and Berkshire in 1519. Francis came in
                                                to his estates in 1543 and at about the same time
                                                married Katherine Fettiplace, a member of a gentry
                                                family from northern Berkshire associated with two
                                                villages with records in this collection – Appleton
                                                and Childrey. In 1547 he served as sheriff of
                                                Oxfordshire and Berkshire, following in his father’s
                                                footsteps. In 1549 he became a member of Princess
                                                Mary’s household and faced several interrogations
                                                from the duke of Northumberland’s council about the
                                                celebration of Catholic rites in her household. With
                                                her succession, his career prospered and he became a
                                                member of her privy council 25 July 1553. He was
                                                elected to four of the five Marian parliaments from
                                                Berkshire and was made keeper of the dissolved abbey
                                                at Reading that the queen, following the lead of
                                                Thomas Seymour, retained as a Crown possession. With
                                                the accession of Elizabeth, Englefield went into
                                                exile on the Continent and his lands and offices of
                                                Berkshire once again returned to the royal

                                                in mid-century did not survive Mary’s death. During
                                                Elizabeth’s reign Berkshire was dominated by a
                                                tightly interwoven group of Protestant families

                                                who held many of the influential royal appointed
                                                positions in the county. He was, for example, high
                                                steward of all four boroughs in the county –
                                                Abingdon, Reading, Wallingford, and New Windsor –
                                                for most of the reign. He was also the second
                                                husband of Lettice Knollys, countess of Essex,
                                                daughter of Sir Francis Knollys and mother of Robert

                                                death in 1588. These members of the new Elizabethan
                                                aristocracy were joined in parliament, for the most

                                                held the majority of their land in Berkshire. The

                                                river near Henley. His son, Sir William, later the
                                                earl of Banbury, built the house where he frequently

                                                Earlier scholarship assumed that these two ambitious
                                                men, both with many sons, were rivals, but the more

                                                based because of the personal relationship between
                                                Queen Elizabeth and their wives. Katherine, Lady
                                                Knollys, was the daughter of Anne Boleyn’s sister
                                                Mary and William Carey, a Berkshire gentleman, and
                                                so the queen’s first cousin. She was a favourite
                                                lady of the bedchamber until her death in 1569, when
                                                the queen paid for her funeral in Westminster Abbey.
                                                Much of the land that provided Sir Francis with his
                                                income came to him as gifts from Elizabeth to her

                                                the queen’s favour in large part because of her
                                                friendship with his wife Margery, or Margaret, the
                                                second daughter and coheir of Lord Williams of
                                                Thame. Williams, as Sir John Williams, had had
                                                custody of Elizabeth on several occasions during the
                                                reign of Mary and entertained her at Rycote on her
                                                way from the Tower to Woodstock. Whether Elizabeth
                                                met Margery Williams then or at some other time we
                                                cannot know, but we do know that Margery was a royal
                                                favourite and given the name ‘my crow’ because she
                                                was very dark. Rycote was Elizabeth’s destination

                                                head of the church. Neville was beheaded but his son

                                                on the Thames north of the Neville estates) since
                                                Thomas Hoby’s wife was another of the Cooke sisters.
                                                The Cooke sisters had been part of the queen’s
                                                childhood and so also had a special claim on her
                                                affections. After Thomas Hoby’s death Elizabeth
                                                married John, Lord Russell, and it is as his widow
                                                that Lady Russell presented an entertainment to the

                                                first Tudor Unton of any prominence, Thomas, had
                                                been sheriff of Oxfordshire and Berkshire and was
                                                knighted at the coronation of Anne Boleyn in 1533.
                                                His elder son Alexander was knighted at the
                                                coronation of Edward VI, and Edward, his grandson
                                                and Alexander’s eldest son, was knighted at the
                                                coronation of Elizabeth. Their seat at Wadley was in
                                                the northwest edge of the county near Faringdon.
                                                Edward succeeded to the family estates after
                                                Alexander’s death. He was the member of parliament
                                                for Malmesbury in 1554, Oxfordshire in 1563, and

                                                  that the 1574 visit took place at Wadley and

                                                  vol 2, p 195). Chambers, however, dates the
                                                  progress from 15 July to 25 September, and records
                                                  that the queen was at Woodstock, just north of
                                                  Oxford, from 24 July to 2 August, and at Burford
                                                  on 3 August (<title>Elizabethan Stage</title>, vol

                                                  overnight, 2–3 August. Although a detour over the
                                                  Berkshire border to Wadley might have been
                                                  possible, the proximity of Langley to Burford
                                                  makes that location more likely.</note> The wider
                                                Dudley connection continued to take an interest in
                                                Anne Seymour and her children by her second
                                                marriage. In this way the Unton children had access
                                                to the households of Lady Mary, wife of Sir Henry
                                                Sidney and mother of Sir Philip Sidney, the earl of
                                                Leicester, Catherine, wife of Henry Hastings, earl
                                                of Huntingdon, and Ambrose, earl of Warwick. The

                                                son, Sir Henry, who had been knighted by Leicester
                                                at Zutphen and had been one of ‘knights and his
                                                kindred and friends’ who walked in Philip Sidney’s
                                                funeral procession in February 1587. He served as
                                                the member for Berkshire in the parliament of 1593.
                                                Through the patronage of Essex he became the
                                                ambassador to France in 1595 and died there in 1596.

                                                earl of Leicester, dominated the life of Elizabethan
                                                Berkshire, serving their turns as members of
                                                parliament, sheriffs, justices of the peace,
                                                commissioners for ecclesiastical causes, lords

                                                old queen and into the reign of James I. Although
                                                all managed to escape with their lives, Sir William
                                                Knollys, Sir Francis Knollys the younger, and Sir
                                                Henry Neville the younger were close enough to Essex
                                                to be suspected in his rebellion. With Elizabeth’s
                                                death the pattern of power in the county became less
                                                clear. Of the Elizabethan families, only the Knollys
                                                continued to hold power. William became first Baron
                                                Knollys of Greys, then Lord Wallingford, and finally
                                                the earl of Banbury. He continued to have influence
                                                in both court and the counties of Berkshire and
                                                Oxford, being lord lieutenant of the two counties
                                                from 1596 until his death, and high steward of
                                                Reading, Abingdon, and Wallingford in Berkshire, and
                                                Banbury and Oxford in Oxfordshire. He lost favour
                                                with the fall of his father-in-law, Thomas Howard,
                                                first earl of Suffolk, and withdrew from the court
                                                after 1619. His brother Francis was the member of

                                                and 1625 and for Reading in 1640. A very old man by
                                                this time, Sir Francis had become a staunch

                                                quiet one in Berkshire, but during the reign of
                                                Charles I, its strategic position once again made it
                                                the centre of the Civil War that was to come. The
                                                military importance of the county, unnoticed for
                                                almost four hundred years, re‑emerged during the
                                                early stages of the war. It was an important link
                                                for Charles between London and his stronghold in
                                                Oxford. The river and its crucial bridges provided
                                                an important defence against the parliamentary
                                                forces advancing from London. However, when Reading
                                                was besieged by the parliamentary army in the spring
                                                of 1643 and surrendered on 27 April, the king
                                                withdrew to Oxford. By the end of that year, the
                                                tide of events had turned and the royalist forces
                                                were once again in control of much of Berkshire. The
                                                parliamentary forces withdrew from Reading and the
                                                town was briefly recaptured by the royalists, only
                                                to be surrendered again in May 1644. Wallingford
                                                Castle was one of the last fortresses in the kingdom
                                                to hold out for Charles I. It was later destroyed by
                                                order of the Commonwealth government so that only a
                                                ruin remains today. The effect of the Civil War on
                                                an already faltering economy was devastating. It was
                                                not until the end of the seventeenth century that
                                                some measure of prosperity returned to the
                                                  county.<note type="foot"><title>VCH:

                                                  fell to the Danes in the ninth century. About 954,
                                                  King Edred chose Ethelwold, then a monk at
                                                  Glastonbury and destined to be bishop of
                                                  Winchester, to refound the abbey and become its
                                                  first abbot. Although small and poor, the new
                                                  abbey – and its abbot – played an important part
                                                  in the tenth‑century monastic revival in England.
                                                  Ethelwold was a friend and disciple of the great
                                                  Dunstan at Glastonbury and shared Dunstan's
                                                  reforming zeal. Aware of the intellectual ferment
                                                  on the Continent, Ethelwold sent Osgar, a trusted
                                                  monk of Abingdon, to study at the great
                                                  Benedictine house at Fleury, recently reformed
                                                  under the influence of Cluny. When Ethelwold
                                                  became bishop of Winchester in 963, Osgar
                                                  succeeded him as abbot at Abingdon, where his
                                                  experience at Fleury became an important influence
                                                  on the life of Abingdon Abbey.<note type="foot"

                                                  became increasingly secular, building his own
                                                  private lodgings and, by the early twelfth

                                                  the 'vill' of Abingdon, was an acrimonious one.
                                                  The matter at issue was whether the townspeople of
                                                  Abingdon, by the fourteenth century a community
                                                  prospering on the wool trade, had the rights of
                                                  burghers to order their lives and markets, or
                                                  whether they were merely tenants of the abbot.
                                                  Parliament found for the abbot, and the final
                                                  century and a half of the life of the abbey was
                                                  spent in constant tension between the townspeople

                                                  tension had been a dispute at the end of the
                                                  fourteenth century between the abbot and the
                                                  neighbouring parish church of St Helen over a

                                                  the focus of communal life in the town was the
                                                  parish of St Helen, and thus a dispute between the
                                                  parish and the abbey was but another aspect of the
                                                  quarrel between the town and the abbey. </p>
                                                <p>The <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/71110/" type="Place_BoroughParish">parish of St Helen</rs> had two medieval guilds
                                                  associated with it. The first, the guild of Our
                                                  Lady, was founded in 1247 and seems to have been a
                                                  typical religious guild of the period. The second,
                                                  the fraternity of the Holy Cross, is harder to
                                                  trace and even harder to define. However, by 1436
                                                  when its records begin, it had undertaken to
                                                  rebuild the bridges across the Thames at Abingdon
                                                  and Culham. The success of this enterprise
                                                  enhanced the reputation of the fraternity and led
                                                  to its incorporation by royal charter in 1441.
                                                  Along with such regular concerns of religious
                                                  guilds as the provision of almshouses and the care
                                                  of the ill and the indigent, this fraternity
                                                  continued its quasi‑municipal concerns by adding
                                                  three extra flood arches to Abingdon bridge.
                                                  Meetings of the fraternity or 'Fellowship' were
                                                  held in a little room called the Exchequer, over
                                                  the north porch of St Helen's Church. Various
                                                  lands, properties, and money accrued to the
                                                  fraternity during the fifteenth and early
                                                  sixteenth centuries. Donations from all over the
                                                  country were stimulated by the action of the first
                                                  two benefactors, Sir John Golafre and William
                                                  Dyer, vicar of Bray, early in the reign of Henry
                                                  VI. During the late fifteenth century, the
                                                  fraternity was a powerful organization, counting
                                                  among its members such prominent local magnates as
                                                  John de la Pole, duke of Suffolk, and Francis,
                                                  Lord Lovell. It also became recognized as the
                                                  representative of the townspeople in their
                                                  struggles with the abbey. In 1520 the fraternity
                                                  procured a renewed charter granting it a three
                                                  days' fair from Henry VIII.<note type="foot"

                                                  in 1548. There followed a period of hiatus in the
                                                  life of the town, but fortunately a native son,
                                                  Sir John Mason, one of Cromwell’s circle and a man
                                                  who survived to serve all four Tudor monarchs as
                                                  counsellor and ambassador, established a way
                                                  forward. Mason, according the letters patent dated
                                                  28 December 1551, took stewardship of the
                                                  dissolved abbey for the court of
                                                  Augmentations.<note type="foot">Calendar of Patent

                                                  period of Abingdon’s life when he was a graduate
                                                  student.</note> This follows hard on a record of

                                                  had occurred the month before, which required a
                                                  special commission of oyer and terminer to
                                                  investigate. Mason had been the member of
                                                  parliament for Reading in 1547. Over the next few
                                                  years he would manage the transition of the
                                                  governing structures of Abingdon, with the help of

                                                  two of the same four masters of the dissolved
                                                  fraternity became members of the town council. By

                                                  of the Thames and the Kennet, became the

                                                  physical nature of the town, built on the marshy
                                                  banks of the Kennet, dictated much of its history.
                                                  There were nineteen bridges within the town – many
                                                  short spans crossing branches of the slow moving
                                                  river – that had to be maintained. The higher
                                                  ground had been claimed by the Benedictine abbey.
                                                  The founder of the abbey, Henry I, intended his
                                                  foundation to be a great pilgrimage site. He
                                                  presented it with the hand of St James in 1126
                                                  and, although that relic remained its greatest
                                                  treasure until Dissolution, by the end of the
                                                  twelfth century it had acquired 241 other relics.

                                                <p>Like Abingdon, until Dissolution the town of
                                                  Reading lived under the shadow of its abbey.
                                                  However, unlike the townspeople of Abingdon, those
                                                  of Reading early came to a sometimes uneasy
                                                  accommodation with their abbot. On 1 February
                                                  1253/4, the settlement of a suit brought by the
                                                  burgesses against the abbot led to an agreement
                                                  whereby the abbot conceded the right of the
                                                  townspeople to hold a corn market and to have a
                                                  guild hall. The abbot annually nominated a burgess
                                                  to be ‘Custos Gildae.’<note type="foot">Macray,

                                                  arrangement held until 24 April 1542 when, after
                                                  several years of diplomacy, the burgesses of
                                                  Reading persuaded Henry VIII to recognize the Gild

                                                  clear from an answer made by Richard Cleche to a
                                                  bill of complaint brought against him by John
                                                  Thone, the abbot of Reading, around the turn of
                                                  the sixteenth century. The abbot had defaulted in
                                                  his duty and no ‘maister of the gilde otherwise

                                                  of three or four years.’ The affairs of the town
                                                  were getting out of hand and the townspeople had
                                                  elected Cleche to bring back some semblance of
                                                  order, since for over a year ‘mysruled people

                                                  was eventually settled. </p>

                                                  status were taken during our period. For example,
                                                  in 1480 it was agreed that the common chest should
                                                  pay the five pence annual tax to the abbot for
                                                  every burgess in the borough.<note type="foot"

                                                  But the abbot continued to exercise jurisdiction
                                                  in many ways. As late as 17 February 1519/20,
                                                  Henry VIII confirmed articles for the regulation
                                                  of the weavers' trade at Reading that empowered
                                                  the abbot ‘to choose one person out of three who
                                                  are to be yearly presented to him to be the keeper

                                                  control Reading and the dissolved abbey. Penyson

                                                  members of the Gild Merchant. Their aim was to
                                                  acquire a charter of incorporation that would
                                                  allow them to control their own affairs in the
                                                  town, without continuing interference from an
                                                  external overlord. The initial leader of the
                                                  struggle for independence was Richard Justice. The
                                                  abbey was dissolved in mid-September 1539 and on 9

                                                  1541, would prove to be particularly important. He
                                                  was a notary and a parishioner of St Laurence’s
                                                  parish, being responsible for the important
                                                  inventory of the parish goods in 1517 and serving
                                                  as churchwarden from 1518–20. In 1523 he became
                                                  one of the members of parliament for the borough.
                                                  From 1523–41 he was clerk of the peace for
                                                  Berkshire. In 1529 Abbot Hugh made him

                                                  Edmunds had experience and he had connections.
                                                  These he put to the disposal of the Gild. Led by
                                                  Mayor Richard Justice, the Gild in 1540 petitioned
                                                  the king for a charter when he came to stay in new
                                                  royal residence; Edmonds ‘almost certainly’ had
                                                  drawn up the petition.<note type="foot">Martin,
                                                  ‘People of Reading,’ p 125.</note> No action was
                                                  taken until 1541. That year, Vachell chose a very
                                                  senior burgess, Richard Turner, as ‘mayor.’ Turner
                                                  was by no means merely a tool for Vachell’s
                                                  ambitions. He had already been ‘mayor’ five times
                                                  since 1523 and was a veteran in the struggle for
                                                  municipal independence. He joined with Edmunds and
                                                  Justice in renewing the petition to the king which
                                                  was at last successful. Henry granted the town its
                                                  first limited charter and, for the first time, the
                                                  Gild Merchant as the new burgess council was able
                                                  to elect its own mayor.<note type="foot">Martin,
                                                  ‘People of Reading,’ pp 127–9.</note> This was the
                                                  first step toward the final incorporation of the
                                                  town in 1560. As they moved toward that event, the
                                                  burgesses of Reading were acutely aware of the
                                                  need to cooperate with the Crown that had the
                                                  power to grant their final wish. Particularly
                                                  during the Protectorate, the leading citizens of
                                                  Reading adhered to the new religion with open
                                                  enthusiasm. For some it was a case of following
                                                  their convictions, but the motivations of others
                                                  were undoubtedly mixed. The reward they all sought
                                                  was unequivocal incorporation that would grant
                                                  them the powers to govern themselves. </p>
                                                <p>The power of the pre-Reformation abbot extended
                                                  over more than the commercial life of the Gild. He
                                                  was also the rector of all three parishes in
                                                  Reading, appointing vicars to serve the parishes.

                                                  and would literally have been the ‘gate-keeper’
                                                  for the many pilgrims thronging to venerate the

                                                  Reading, St Laurence’s was dependant on the abbey
                                                  for its leadership and for its continuing
                                                  prosperity. This prosperity allowed the parish to
                                                  create a rich tradition of parish drama and
                                                  festive customs. This tradition could not survive
                                                  the religious transformation of the mid-sixteenth

                                                <p>The first blow to St Laurence’s prosperity came
                                                  with the physical seizure of the abbey precinct.
                                                  During the last years of Henry’s reign the
                                                  physical property of the abbey itself, and the
                                                  local land holdings that had supported it, began
                                                  to be distributed. Thomas Vachell received
                                                  substantial property in the town, as did Sir
                                                  William Gray, a prominent anti-papal satirist,
                                                  writer of ballads, and associate of Cromwell, who
                                                  would become the member of parliament for Reading
                                                  in the first Edwardian parliament.<note

                                                  of the abbey itself, the Crown had acquired an
                                                  asset that would be used by members of the royal
                                                  house for close to a century. As Slade has put it,
                                                  ‘The king could utilise high quality buildings at
                                                  so convenient a distance from London, so royal
                                                  accommodation was set up, concentrated on the
                                                  former abbot’s lodging.’ The first ‘keeper of the
                                                  mansion house or chief mansion of Reading’ was
                                                  William Penyson, who also received the profits
                                                  from the two annual fairs held in the Forbury –
                                                  the courtyard behind St Laurence’s between the
                                                  abbey gates and the handsome and capacious abbot’s
                                                  house. At the same time stables for the royal
                                                  horses were created in the dormitory of the former
                                                  guesthouse, to the north of St Laurence’s, that
                                                  would be used well into Stuart times. Henry VIII
                                                  himself was there only briefly but his children
                                                  would all spend more time there. More important,
                                                  as Slade remarks, ‘even if used only occasionally,
                                                  the royal accommodation had to be kept

                                                  with the Dissolution, under the Protectorate, of
                                                  chantry chapels and religious guilds. Much of St
                                                  Laurence’s income had come from the fees paid to
                                                  the chantry chapels that were sustained by the
                                                  Jesus Guild and the Guild of Our Lady. At the same
                                                  time many of the money-making activities in the
                                                  festive season were being curtailed. St Laurence’s
                                                  was physically too close to the royal officials to
                                                  flaunt the new prohibitions as the country
                                                  parishes could. The last vicar appointed before
                                                  Dissolution was a man called John Maynsforth, who
                                                  had been curate and who served until his death in
                                                  1550. From 1550 until 1565 the parish had no vicar
                                                  but was served by transient clergy.<note

                                                  declining income and no clerical leadership led to
                                                  a severe decline in the place of St Laurence’s in
                                                  the town, despite the fact that many of the
                                                  leading citizens continued to be parishioners. </p>

                                                  of Reading’ and profits from the two fairs held in
                                                  the Forbury were acquired by Seymour himself. It
                                                  is possible that he stayed in the ‘royal
                                                  accommodation in the abbey’ during the summer of
                                                  1548. Shortly thereafter he and Sir Richard
                                                  Sackville, of the court of Augmentation, ordered
                                                  the roofs of the conventual buildings of the abbey
                                                  – the church, the cloisters, the dormitory, and
                                                  the chapter house – to be stripped for their lead.
                                                  The task took three months to complete. This
                                                  particularly spectacular act of plunder was
                                                  included in the accusations against him when he
                                                  fell from power and was beheaded in January 1552.
                                                  The stripping of the roofs essentially laid the
                                                  conventual buildings open to destruction both by
                                                  the weather and the citizens of Reading, who used
                                                  the stone for many purposes including the repair
                                                  of the roads and bridges. One of the major uses of
                                                  building material from the site was for the

                                                  counsellor, Sir Francis Englefield, was appointed
                                                  keeper of the abbey, during which time the parish
                                                  of St Laurence finally acquired a small churchyard
                                                  of its own in the old ‘Forbury.’ When Englefield
                                                  went into exile, the direct control of the abbey
                                                  once again reverted to the Crown.<note type="foot"

                                                  in 1560, the Crown devolved to the town the
                                                  responsibility for the school, but also the

                                                  house remained a royal residence that was used
                                                  extensively during the reign of Elizabeth, either
                                                  by the queen or her ministers, and had to be kept
                                                  in a state of readiness. We know from Nichols that
                                                  Elizabeth visited Reading in 1568, 1592, and 1602,
                                                  and stayed there for a month in 1572, accompanied

                                                  government. The borough council was to consist of
                                                  nine head burgesses (including the mayor), and
                                                  twelve or more secondary burgesses. Corporately
                                                  they could own lands and tenements and collect
                                                  rents to maintain the borough and administer its

                                                  constables and watchmen. Among the
                                                  responsibilities of the council was to be the

                                                  and three years after Reading was named a staple
                                                  town, the trade depression of the 1620s took hold.
                                                  The problems of the industry were compounded by
                                                  outbreaks of the plague in 1625 and 1630–1. By the

                                                  Reading, as cloth lay unsold and the mayor of
                                                  Reading sought freedom from the privy council to

                                                  Nothing was able to stop the steady decline of
                                                  prosperity and the steady increase of concern for
                                                  the poor. By the end of our period the problems
                                                  were further compounded by the occupation of the
                                                  town by both the royalist and parliamentary
                                                  troops, forcing loans and demanding quarters. The
                                                  townspeople became preoccupied with their own
                                                  troubles and suspicious of strangers who might
                                                  become charges upon the town, as we can see from
                                                  the increasing custom of paying the travelling
                                                  players not to play but to leave town as quickly
                                                  as possible. The successful prosperity of the
                                                  mid‑sixteenth century had changed to defensive
                                                  poverty a century later. </p>

                                                  importance of the town declined. Part of the
                                                  reason for this was the new bridges at Abingdon,

                                                  Gloucester, away from Wallingford. By 1438, where
                                                  there had once been eleven parishes, there were
                                                  only four, and by the time Leland visited the town
                                                  in 1542 he recorded ‘there be but 3 poore Paroch

                                                  miles northeast to its present location. The town
                                                  grew up around the castle. By a charter first
                                                  granted by Edward I in 1277, Windsor was a free
                                                  borough with a guild merchant. The guild, the
                                                  guild of the Holy Trinity, seems to have been a
                                                  combination of the guild merchant situation in
                                                  Reading and the religious guild model of Abingdon.
                                                  Edward IV granted a charter of incorporation in
                                                  1467, providing for a mayor, bailiffs, and
                                                  burgesses. This charter and the rights it granted
                                                  to the town were all confirmed by Henry VII in
                                                  1500, Henry VIII in 1515, and by Edward VI in
                                                  1550. James I granted a new charter in 1603.<note

                                                <p>The major incident in the early modern history of
                                                  Windsor was the trial and execution of the
                                                  so-called ‘Windsor martyrs’ – Protestants who died
                                                  for their cause in Windsor in 1544. The issue was
                                                  the Act of the Six Articles, passed by the privy
                                                  council after the fall of Cromwell, that upheld
                                                  the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist and
                                                  denied the right of clergy to marry. The
                                                  ringleader of the resistance to this or any
                                                  measure that smacked of a return to Rome was one
                                                  of the choirmen in St George’s Chapel, Windsor,
                                                  Robert Testwood. Implicated in his actions were
                                                  Henry Filman, Anthony Pearson, a priest, and the
                                                  organist of the Chapel Royal, John Merbecke.
                                                  Evidence of their sacramentarian heresy was
                                                  gathered and delivered to Stephen Gardiner, the
                                                  conservative bishop of Winchester and a leading
                                                  member of the failing Henry VIII’s privy council.
                                                  Although Merbecke was pardoned, Testwood, Filman,
                                                  and Pearson were eventually burned at the stake in

                                                  prosperous. Then, as now, it lived under the
                                                  skirts of the castle and had only a small cloth

                                                  but had no representation after 1337.<note

                                                  medieval Newbury was the large hospital of St
                                                  Bartholomew’s that survived Dissolution to be

                                                  From the first extant charter of 1596, it is clear

                                                  majority of the evidence comes from the
                                                  churchwardens' accounts of twenty separate
                                                  parishes. Each parish has a different history and
                                                  different customs, but as the wardens of each
                                                  carefully recorded their receipts and
                                                  expenditures, they incidentally preserved for us
                                                  shards of evidence of folk drama and other
                                                  activity in Berkshire. </p>
                                                <p>The survival of the evidence owes much to the
                                                  dedication of local antiquarians. Arthur Preston,
                                                  both mayor of Abingdon and churchwarden of St
                                                  Helen's, saw that the manuscripts of both
                                                  corporation and parish were preserved and wrote
                                                  much about the district. Charles Kerry, curate of
                                                  St Laurence's, Reading, lovingly worked over the
                                                  churchwardens' books and published a history of
                                                  the parish in 1883, which he dedicated to the
                                                  mayor and the town council. Some antiquarians were
                                                  even more ambitious. Two eighteenth‑century
                                                  gentlemen, one called Richards and another called
                                                  Mores, sent round a questionnaire to all the
                                                  Berkshire parishes, inquiring about local customs.

                                                  eighteenth‑century survivals that may reflect
                                                  earlier activity. Local parish histories abound
                                                  from Berkshire and are often based as much on this
                                                  type of evidence as they are on the transcriptions
                                                  of original documents. Some amateur historians,
                                                  frustrated by lack of local evidence, make
                                                  assertions that are not borne out by the sparse
                                                  facts available. Nevertheless, much that might
                                                  have been destroyed has been preserved, restored,
                                                  and made available for research through the
                                                  efforts and concerns of parish antiquarians. </p>

                                        <p>This Easter play was the culmination of the complex
                                                combination of liturgy and drama celebrated by the
                                                parish since at least 1498 when the detailed
                                                churchwardens’ accounts begin. Much has been written
                                                about the relationship of liturgy and drama in
                                                western Europe, especially since the interpolation
                                                into the Easter mass in the tenth century of the
                                                Quem Quaeritis trope – an enactment of the visit of
                                                the three Marys to the empty tomb of Christ and

                                                850). Amalarius describes the Carolingian mass of

                                                starts his description with the ceremonies for Palm
                                                Sunday that began with the blessing of the flowers
                                                and the palm branches that would be used in the
                                                procession. The main procession, representing the
                                                people of Jerusalem, normally with their flowers and
                                                palms, proceeded around the outside of the church
                                                and made four stops. At the first it met with a
                                                secondary procession of people carrying a reliquary
                                                containing the consecrated host representing Christ.
                                                At the second stop at the door of the church,
                                                choirboys representing the ‘children of the Hebrews’
                                                were placed in a high place, often on a scaffold
                                                over the porch, singing ‘Gloria laus et honor’ – the
                                                traditional Palm Sunday hymn. At the third stop,
                                                inside the church, a versicle based on Caiphas’
                                                words from John 8.14, ‘It is expedient that one man
                                                should die for the people,’ was sung, sometimes by
                                                someone dressed as a prophet. In St Laurence’s,
                                                Reading, there are four specific payments made to a
                                                man called ‘Loreman’ for playing the prophet ‘on

                                        <p>At the daily mass during Holy Week, the four versions of
                                                the Passion story in the four gospels were sung –
                                                from Matthew on Palm Sunday itself, from Mark on
                                                Tuesday, from Luke on Wednesday, and from John on
                                                Good Friday. These parts were traditionally taken by
                                                three separate voices – the treble sang the words of
                                                the Jews and the disciples, the ‘mean’ the words of

                                                needed for the regular liturgical celebrations.
                                                Since the heart of the mass itself is the

                                                took place on the Thursday of Holy Week), the focus
                                                of the Maundy Thursday liturgy was preparation for
                                                the days to follow. Three hosts were consecrated –
                                                one for the mass that day and two for Good Friday
                                                (one for the Good Friday mass and one to be ‘buried’
                                                with the cross at the end of the Good Friday
                                                liturgy). Thursday began with the readmittance of
                                                the penitents and ended with the ‘rememorative’ act
                                                of washing the disciples’ feet by Christ. Over the

                                                cry for mercy from the choir.’ Then came the
                                                adoration of the cross by the priests and then the
                                                people. Finally the cross and the host consecrated

                                                recorded in the churchwardens’ accounts we can

                                                  Romish Church</title> may have happened in St
                                                Laurence’s. In 1506 the wardens record a payment of
                                                2 1/2d to Sybil Darling, the widow of a prominent
                                                parishioner who died that year, for a combination of

                                                that ‘one of the simplest methods of producing an
                                                effect of lightning is to cast a powder such as
                                                rosin into or over a flame to produce a flash of
                                                  fire.’<note type="foot">Philip Butterworth,

                                                relight the candles, there is a possibility that the
                                                moment of Resurrection was marked at St Laurence’s
                                                with a flash of light. </p>
                                        <p>We cannot know if the Easter celebration was further
                                                embellished in St Laurence’s. However, there are two
                                                further pieces of possible evidence for the Easter
                                                plays – costumes and props being built in 1523. In
                                                that same year a ‘Cotte for Mary Magdeleyn of Cloth

                                                impossible to know whether these items refer to the
                                                liturgical ceremonies or to the actual play
                                                performed later in the week. What is clear is that
                                                in St Laurence’s the Easter season was marked by a
                                                combination of prophecy, recitation of the Passion
                                                story, liturgy with some mimesis, and dramatizations
                                                of the Resurrection appearances. The expenses that
                                                are probably for liturgical use only in the St
                                                Laurence’s churchwardens’ accounts are not included
                                                in the records. However, the entire celebration of
                                                the Easter season for a parishioner of St Laurence’s
                                                in the early sixteenth century presented a seamless
                                                series of liturgical and dramatic events that was
                                                rich and resonant with the meaning of season. </p>
                                        <p>There is possible evidence for two other mimetic Easter
                                                events in the county. The accounts of St George’s
                                                Windsor for 1451–2 record a payment for a costume
                                                for a player ‘<quote source="#berks-ridm243254832"
                                                  >in festo pasche</quote>’ along with other play
                                                expenses that may or may not be for an Easter play.
                                                The accounts for that year include payments for a
                                                play at the time of the founder’s feast and it is
                                                unclear if any of the playmaking items beyond the
                                                single costume are related to the Easter event. The
                                                churchwardens of St Giles’, Reading, paid to have
                                                scaffolds made before the rood loft in 1518, and in
                                                1520 paid a penny halfpenny ‘for nayles [cord] cord

                                                in the county. The earliest comes from the

                                                includes ‘playes’ in the activities of the guild of

                                                considerable later evidence comes from both Reading
                                                and Abingdon. Both were on main roads between London
                                                and the west. The main road from London to the west
                                                forked first near what is now Hownslow following the
                                                route of what is now the A4. It forked again just
                                                beyond Bray (possibly at Twyford) with one branch
                                                curving north, going cross-country to cross the
                                                looping river farther north at Abingdon on the
                                                bridge built by the guild of the Holy Trinity and
                                                the second branch following the river to cross it at
                                                Reading. The roads converged again at Bristol.
                                                Travelling through either town would lead troupes to
                                                the southwest but the route through Abingdon also
                                                connected to the road north through Gloucester to
                                                the West Midlands and the Marches of Wales.<note

                                                accounts do not survive from the same years (the run
                                                of accounts from Abingdon is 1558–83 while those
                                                from Reading are 1587–1632), so it is impossible to
                                                tell whether any travellers went from one town to
                                                another, although there was a medieval road that ran
                                                directly from Reading to Oxford that would have

                                                the companies of Edmund Blount, Lord Mountjoy
                                                (possibly on their way home to the west country),
                                                and the earl of Worcester. Single visits were made
                                                by the players of Lord Compton, Lord Berkeley, and

                                                times before 1603, as did the players of Queen Anne

                                                twice in 1619–20 but when the later company

                                                sent away without playing. The players of King
                                                Charles I presented their licence six times between
                                                1626 and 1633 but four times were sent away. Three
                                                groups of anonymous players were paid 1632–3. Single
                                                visits were made by the players of the earls of
                                                Leicester and Essex in the 1580s and Prince Charles

                                        <p>The over-riding imperative in the life of all English
                                                parish churches in our period was the need to keep
                                                the fabric of the building and the churchyard in
                                                repair. Many of these churches were several hundred
                                                years old by the sixteenth century and needed
                                                constant upkeep. The clergy were responsible for the
                                                building east of the rood screen (that is the
                                                chancel and its adjacent spaces that served the
                                                needs of the clergy) but the parishioners, under the
                                                leadership of the churchwardens, were responsible
                                                for the nave of the church, any side chapels, the
                                                tower, the porch, the churchyard, and any gate
                                                leading in to the grounds. There were usually two
                                                wardens chosen by the parish but sometimes this
                                                number was as many as four, as in Wantage, where the
                                                parish in this period was larger than the town and
                                                encompassed three smaller neighbouring communities.
                                                The traditional means of raising money was through
                                                community festive events held in the period from
                                                Easter to 24 June (midsummer) when the crops were in
                                                the ground but were not yet ready to be harvested.
                                                The community festivals ranged from ‘gatherings’ or
                                                collections of money in the context of quasi-mimetic
                                                or mimetic customs such as hocking or Robin Hood
                                                games to the ubiquitous ‘church ale’ where the
                                                parishioners brewed ale and came together for
                                                feasting and celebration.<note type="foot">For a

                                                <p>The first regular parish custom was gatherings at
                                                  Hocktide – the Monday and Tuesday of the second
                                                  week after Easter. Earlier scholarship saw this
                                                  custom as a time for ‘unbridled sport and
                                                  merriment,’ but in 1936 A.R. Wright realized that
                                                  it had a deeper purpose and defined it as a
                                                  festival where the purpose was to trip people up
                                                  and bind them ‘in order to enforce payment of

                                                  men, as with the student in the Oxford example,
                                                  would have more money to give away than the women.
                                                  There are two other references to hocking custom
                                                  recorded in the Berkshire records. The first comes
                                                  from the parish of St John the Baptist in Windsor.
                                                  The wardens record a Hock Monday gathering from
                                                  1563 (when the records begin) until 1583. Windsor,
                                                  with its many royal officials, would have been a
                                                  profitable community for the parish to tap. The
                                                  second reference is in the Wallingford town record
                                                  for 1538–9 where the borough officials are
                                                  relieved that they will no longer have to pay for
                                                  the expensive costumes that were part of the
                                                  town’s Hocktide dance. </p>

                                                  was ‘church ale.’<note type="foot">May Day,
                                                  Pentecost (Whitsun), or the feast of St John the
                                                  Baptist (midsummer) were the most common days
                                                  chosen.</note> The essential activity of an ale
                                                  was the brewing and drinking of ale within the
                                                  parish setting but most ales included food as
                                                  well, with various activities designed to bring in
                                                  money for the parish such as Robin Hood events,
                                                  king games, minstrelsy, and dancing. These
                                                  festivals were sometimes ‘proclaimed’ over a wide
                                                  area. In 1599 the Wallingford midsummer fair was
                                                  ‘proclaimed’ as far afield as Newbury as well as
                                                  at Henley in Oxfordshire and Reading. The most
                                                  detailed records for a single such event from
                                                  Berkshire come from the accounts of St Mary’s,
                                                  Reading, from the Marian years 1555 and 1556 with
                                                  entries for food and drink, costumes, musicians,
                                                  dancers, and a hobby horse all jumbled together
                                                  to, themselves, give the sense of the bustle and
                                                  confusion of the event. All three Reading parishes
                                                  record expenses for the badges or ‘liveries’ to
                                                  indicate that the wearer had paid the price of
                                                  admission. Entries concerning liveries are almost
                                                  constant in the St Laurence’s records from 1501 to
                                                  1514 for their major fund-raiser of the year. In
                                                  this period the price for the badges was
                                                  twenty-five liveries for a penny. The largest
                                                  number of liveries made in any one year was 500 in
                                                  1512–13. The price of liveries had doubled by
                                                  mid-century when St Mary’s records the payment for
                                                  the painting of 250 liveries in 1556. These were
                                                  large and significant events in the life of the
                                                  town. </p>
                                                <p>St Laurence’s was by far the largest parish in
                                                  the county. It was principally an urban parish
                                                  with an estimated 1,000 communicants in 1548. This
                                                  is to be compared with the other two Reading
                                                  parishes, St Giles’ and St Mary’s, whose
                                                  communicants were estimated to be 500 at the same
                                                  time. Both these parishes included communicants
                                                  from rural communities.<note type="foot">Martin,

                                                  Laurence’s was also the parish of the leading lay
                                                  members of the town and had close ties with the
                                                  rich and powerful abbey. It is not surprising that
                                                  they were able to have such a rich parish life. It
                                                  is, however, difficult, without the corrective of
                                                  evidence from neighbouring counties, to build a
                                                  coherent pattern from these accounts. In the
                                                  discussion that follows, therefore, the records of
                                                  Reading St Laurence’s are not seen in isolation
                                                  but within the context of the larger pattern that
                                                  has been established by the collaborative work of
                                                  REED editors and then related to the activities of

                                                  activities were encouraged to fill the coffers of
                                                  the parish. Lords and ladies of the summer

                                                  Thatcham (1606) and Ashampstead (1617), and into
                                                  the reign of Charles I at Warfield near Windsor
                                                  (1631), Wantage (1635), and Stanford in the Vale
                                                  of the White Horse (1642). Newbury’s parish
                                                  records survive from 1601 and from the first
                                                  entries their ale was held in the guildhall to
                                                  avoid the use of church property. That festival
                                                  ended in 1631. The church of St John the Baptist
                                                  in Windsor held its last fund-raiser in 1582. The
                                                  picture in Reading, however, with the presence of
                                                  royal officials in the town from the dissolution
                                                  of the abbey on, is quite different. The records
                                                  of St Mary’s, the more rural of the Reading
                                                  parishes, begin in 1556 with Marian exuberance and
                                                  the summer festival continued until 1567. The king
                                                  games of St Giles’ end with the accession of
                                                  Elizabeth, having been suspended during Edward’s
                                                  reign. Although some play entries continue in the
                                                  records of St Laurence’s after 1532–3 there is a
                                                  gap of eight years until there is another festive
                                                  fund-raiser in 1540–1. There were four more in the
                                                  declining years of Henry’s reign, none under
                                                  Edward, and two small Marian revivals. The last
                                                  related entry is the sale of the summer pole for a
                                                  shilling in 1557–8. The festive life of what had
                                                  been one of the most active parishes in the
                                                  country ended early to the disappointment of some
                                                  of the parishioners. </p>
                                                <p>As we have seen these festive gatherings provided
                                                  an income for the repair and renewal of the
                                                  buildings and grounds. During the reigns of Edward
                                                  VI and Elizabeth the church authorities – in
                                                  Berkshire the bishop of Salisbury and his
                                                  archdeacons in particular – came to disapprove of
                                                  raising any money for the church by such
                                                  apparently secular activities and, when they were
                                                  discovered through the occasional visitation of a
                                                  parish by the archdeacons and sometimes by the
                                                  bishop, they were forbidden. But the churchwardens
                                                  were still responsible for their ancient buildings
                                                  and new ways of raising money had to be found. In
                                                  1572 the churchwardens of St Laurence’s, Reading,

                                                  wine, and the sale of produce – both vegetables
                                                  and meat – donated by parishioners. Sometimes
                                                  money was donated for specific items of the fabric
                                                  that needed repair or for the bells. But this was
                                                  not enough to keep the fabric of the church in
                                                  repair. Major collections were solicited from the
                                                  parishioners. The first was in 1611–12 while they
                                                  were still having church ales but the four other
                                                  levies occur in the periods when there were no
                                                  summer events to add to the income – in 1617–18,
                                                  1627–8, 1630–1, and again in 1631–2. That year a
                                                  major renovation was undertaken. Ninety-seven
                                                  members of the parish donated £199 14s 8d. The
                                                  donations of three parishioners – Sir Robert
                                                  Knollys, one of his kinsmen, Francis Knollys, and
                                                  a widow recently moved to the parish – amounted to
                                                  £61 0s 16d, close to thirty percent of the total.
                                                  Unfortunately, the total expenses for the building
                                                  project were £220 6s 7d. The fund-raising events
                                                  alone could not meet the costs of such major
                                                  rebuilding but they added sufficient income to
                                                  allow the parish to maintain their normal
                                                  expenses. </p>

                                                  White Horse) consisted of the town itself on the
                                                  south end of the parish and two other villages,
                                                  Charlton (half a mile east of Wantage) and Grove
                                                  (one mile and a half north of Wantage). The
                                                  straggling settlement of West Lockinge hugged the
                                                  boundary of Wantage. The church of Sts Peter and
                                                  Paul is in the centre of the town itself and was
                                                  largely built in the fifteenth century although it
                                                  incorporates thirteenth-century pillars. Its
                                                  advowson was complex. By the twelfth century it
                                                  was in the hands of the bishop of Salisbury but it
                                                  was later annexed to the priory of Ogbourne in
                                                  Wiltshire. The bishop of Salisbury made some
                                                  unsuccessful attempts to exercise patronage over
                                                  the parish in the fourteenth century but the
                                                  priory continued to hold the advowson until Henry
                                                  V dissolved the alien priories in the fifteenth
                                                  century. The spiritualities of the priory were
                                                  then given to the duke of Bedford who, in his
                                                  turn, gave them to the dean and canons of Windsor
                                                  in 1422. Although the bishop of Salisbury
                                                  continued to be concerned with this designation in
                                                  the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the
                                                  parish remained under the jurisdiction of the dean

                                                  The dean of Windsor had begun to crack down on
                                                  raising money through parish entertainments. There
                                                  are no more ales for eight years and the parish
                                                  tried to finance itself through what they called a
                                                  ‘taxation.’ During these years, expenses for the
                                                  parrator or an actual visitation appear in the
                                                  accounts. The taxation was not proving adequate.
                                                  In 1590–1 a mere 12s was raised and the parish had
                                                  an ale that brought in £5 4s 3d. The next year the
                                                  taxation brought in £1 16s 11d while the ale that
                                                  included a summer pole and a bowery earned £4 15s
                                                  2d. But the parrator was there that year. In
                                                  1592–3 there was no ale. For the next four years
                                                  the parish struggled to have both an ale and a
                                                  taxation but the dean put an end to ales until
                                                  1603–4 when the parish once again supplemented the
                                                  taxation with an ale. They were able to do that
                                                  again in 1604–5 but between them they raised only
                                                  £6 12s 1d. Forced to be more systematic about the
                                                  taxation, the next year the form for recording the
                                                  taxation changed with the villages of Grove,
                                                  Charlton, and West Lockinge all being separately
                                                  taxed. This situation, with frequent mention of
                                                  the parrator, continued until 1609–10 when a large
                                                  expense of £6 12s 6d to a bell-founder in Reading
                                                  put the parish deeply in debt. In 1610–11 they
                                                  held a very successful ale that raised £11 10s
                                                  which, with a taxation, allowed them to recoup
                                                  their losses from the year before and carry
                                                  forward £3 16s 5d. However, that year there are
                                                  expenses for a visit from the dean of Salisbury’s
                                                  deputy. There were no ales for the next five years
                                                  with visits from both the bishop and dean of
                                                  Salisbury in 1613–14. By the end of 1614–15,
                                                  although there had been no major expenses, with
                                                  just the taxation as a major item of income, the
                                                  carry forward was only 17s 8d. In 1615–16 the
                                                  parish again made a healthy sum of £11 18s ‘<quote

                                                  amounted to £23 1s 1d but there were so many small

                                                  agreed to raise the taxation because in 1622–3 the
                                                  tower of the church had to be repaired. £42 15s 2d
                                                  was raised and £40 14s 8d was spent – including

                                                  when major repairs were needed on the bells and

                                                Saunders seems to have been one of the few prominent

                                        <p>The fullest account of social or country dancing comes
                                                from Coxwell Magna in 1599. Robert Ricattes of
                                                Coxwell Magna was answering a charge in the
                                                archdeacon’s court of impregnating Jane Druet.
                                                Ricattes admitted to the charge but then laid a
                                                counter accusation against four young people –
                                                Edward Perkins the younger, John Coates, and Thomas
                                                and Katherine Jackson (the children of Richard
                                                Jackson) – whom, he claimed, had been dancing in
                                                service time in the house of Thomas Ogborne. By the

                                                as servants, had been accused of being part of the
                                                party. </p>

                                                accompaniment and the records provide rich evidence
                                                of music as part of the life of the abbeys, the
                                                ceremonial life of the towns, and the celebrations
                                                of the parishes. Several professional musicians are
                                                named in the records with several country
                                                practitioners being paid by more than one parish to
                                                play at their annual fund-raiser.</p>

                                                over-painted in some of the scenes. The portrait is
                                                painted on three horizontal boards and the authors
                                                of the web site suggest that ‘the painting may

                                                Wroughton's home at Wadley when the tomb was
                                                completed in 1606. The tomb was destroyed during the
                                                Civil War.’ Lady Unton must then have framed the

                                                  Goodall was a 'lewde fellow' (f 133), who 'wold

                                                <p> An interesting feature of the case is that

                                                  1640. There is no mention in it of his being a
                                                  musician. Shawe's will was made 13 July 1614 and
                                                  proved 1 February 1614/15. His total assets (£37

                                                  195–6). Slade is correct. The two historians were

                                                <p> Seventeen folios (34 pages) of inventories of
                                                  church goods intervene between one part of this
                                                  account and the next (pp 41–73). The inventories
                                                  are full and detailed and were taken in the years
                                                  1517 and 1523–4. Some misbinding has confused the
                                                  lists. The inventories emphasize the wealth of the
                                                  parish during the early years of the sixteenth
                                                  century. They include listings of such things as
                                                  relics (a piece of the True Cross and a bone of St
                                                  Laurence) and liturgical silver and plate as well
                                                  as vestments, altar cloths, service books (many
                                                  with the incipits noted), and pricksong books.

                                                <p> Kerry agrees with the reading of 'Ioyaunt,' but

                                                  (Charles Kerry?) on page 279. This is an error
                                                  since the leaf in question (pp 275–6) is from the

                                                  that begin on p 281. The leaf should have been
                                                  inserted between pp 282 and 283. The accounts for
                                                  1556–7 begin with a new hand on p 284. I have

                                                  mention in these accounts of any customary
                                                  activities. By this time they had clearly become a
                                                  thing of the past. Since pews had been rented
                                                  almost since the beginning of the sixteenth
                                                  century the implication that this custom was to

                                                  seems reasonable to expand them as we have done,

                                                  superlineated 'o' in the accounts for 1619–20.

                                                  year is given twice on f 3: once as 3 April 1555,
                                                  and once as 3 May. One of the two is obviously
                                                  incorrect. The May date is more likely to be
                                                  correct: 3 April was Good Friday, while 3 May was
                                                  the fourth Sunday after Easter. It also seems more
                                                  reasonable that a clerk would accidentally write
                                                  in the month it had been only four days before the
                                                  accounting, rather than jumping ahead a month.

                                                  taxation (f 65), but by the end of the year after

                                                  (f 66 v). The ale in 1610 was clearly an attempt

                                                <p>It is REED policy not to include payment for entertainment for the court. Ian Lancashire mentions this record (<title>Dramatic Texts and Records of Britain: A Chronological Topography to 1558</title>, Studies in Early English Drama 1 (Toronto and Buffalo, 1984), p 285) and compares it to royal payments for Henry VI at Christmas 1449 (p 182). However, this record is not simply a ‘royal’ account. In a letter to the editor of this collection, Dr Lynn Muir of the University of Leeds wrote, 
                                                  'St George's at that time was a college of
                                                  secular canons and the reference [to college] may
                                                  simply imply performance in <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/75610/" type="Place_Feature">St George's chapel</rs>
                                                  itself. However, it may equally suggest
                                                  performance in one of the College residential
                                                  buildings such as the large hall, known as the
                                                  vicar's hall [the present chapter library] built
                                                  in 1415. It is important to note that St George's
                                                  was NOT a chapel royal. It was/is the
                                                  King's/Queen's free chapel of St George, 'free'
                                                  indicating freedom from any episcopal oversight.
                                                  The distinction is one of use – the sovereign only
                                                  attended services in St George's upon special
                                                  occasions usually connected with the order of the
                                                  Garter of which this was the official chapel. It
                                                  was, so to speak, a guild chapel. There was a
                                                  separate Chapel Royal used by the royal family in
                                                  the upper ward of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/38267/" type="Place_BoroughParish">the Castle</rs> near the state
                                                  apartments. St George's is in the lower ward which
                                                  is not crown property but is owned and run
                                                  entirely by the College who are responsible for
                                                  the upkeep of the Chapel and their own salaries
