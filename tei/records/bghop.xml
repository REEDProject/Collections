          <p>This collection of Bear Gardens/Hope Playhouse records is the second digital edition of
            London area Renaissance and Jacobean playhouses for the <title>REED Online</title>
            series. We are delighted to acknowledge here the support and expertise of several
            members of the REED editorial team. Hovland, in particular, as a ‘new’ editor is
            especially grateful for their help in understanding the intricacies of the final stages
            in the production of a REED collection online.</p>

          <p>Tanya Hagen, REED's bibliographer and managing editor, has been an invaluable and
            supportive companion along the way, first as our research paths converged while she
            edited the Bear Gardens/Hope bibliographic data for the <title>Early Modern London
              Theatres</title> website and lately as bibliographic support and production manager of
            the completed collection. REED's associate editor and paleographer, Patrick Gregory,
            checked all transcriptions, patiently sorted out our many queries, and contributed Latin
            translations and glossary entries. REED's research associate, Illya Nokhrin, took
            primary responsibility for indexing this complex collection and brought initiative to a
            variety of other technical responsibilities, including the development of the timeline
            feature. Two graduate research assistants contributed as well: Sara Ameri Mahabadi
            checked the bibliography and Jenna McKellips did content checking and assisted in
            indexing. Additional help in the archives was provided by graduate student Michael
            Powell-Davies, and Professor Sue Wiseman, his supervisor at Birkbeck College, University
            of London.</p>

          <p>MacLean's long-time collaborator, Byron Moldofsky, deserves special mention for his
            cartographic skills and ongoing interest in developing a more ambitious project to map
            not only the Southwark area in historic detail but also the wider London area for more
            playhouse editions to come. The timeline feature was first developed at his
            recommendation.</p>

          <p>The <title>Bear Gardens/Hope Playhouse</title> collection, like other REED digital
            editions, would not appear on our screens without the expertise and advice of our former
            programmer, the late Jamie Norrish, and his successor, Miguel Vieira, Principal Research
            Software Engineer at King's Digital Lab, with whom we are privileged to work.</p>

          <p>The inclusion of manuscript digital images has been made possible through permissions
            granted by the following archives: The National Archives, The British Library, the
            London Metropolitan Archives (City of London) and the Parliamentary Archives. Our thanks
            to Paul Johnson (TNA) and Laurence Ward and Wendy Hawke (LMA) for responding to requests
            for help with permission to publish transcriptions. We are grateful to Justine Horseman
            Sewell and Southwark Cathedral for permission to include images from the St Saviour's
            Vestry Minutes now held at LMA. Special thanks go to Calista Lucy, Keeper of the
            Archives at Dulwich College, and to Grace Ioppolo, Director of the
              <title>Henslowe-Alleyn Digitisation Project</title>, who granted permission to link
            our transcriptions to the professional images on the open access
              <title>Henslowe-Alleyn</title> website. We want to acknowledge warmly Calista Lucy's
            welcome and assistance when visiting the Archives at Dulwich College, and similarly we
            are grateful to the staff of The National Archives, especially to Daniel Gosling, Legal
            Records Specialist (Early Modern), who advised us on the idiosyncrasies of the records
            of the Exchequer. Thanks are also due to the staff of the London Metropolitan Archives
            and of the Surrey History Centre for advice given during our research of their
            collections.</p>

          <p>We are indebted to William Ingram and Alan Nelson, whose generous work on the parish
            records of St Saviour's Southwark, freely available on the web, has assisted ours in so
            many ways. Alan also shared with us his spreadsheet of names, dates and occupations
            culled from St Saviour's parish registers and his transcriptions of letters patent for
            the Masters of the Bears, Bulls and Mastiff Dogs from 1553 to 1638. We have benefited
            from encouragement and discussions with many other colleagues over the course of our
            research and thank them all for their interest and support. This collection has had
            specific improvements thanks to the helpful suggestions made by our external
            assessors.</p>

          <p>Research for this publication has been supported by several granting agencies to whom
            MacLean owes lasting gratitude. An Insight grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities
            Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) funded the initial research phase for the Bear
            Gardens/Hope and four other playhouses south of the river. The British Academy's ongoing
            grants for bibliographic work on the <title>Early Modern London Theatres</title> website
            contributed to comprehensive study of relevant print sources to be linked with our
            record transcriptions. MacLean's research travel was enabled by several personal grants
            from Victoria College at the University of Toronto. We also want to acknowledge the help
            of Christopher Catling, Director, and the generous funding awarded by the Marc Fitch
            Fund in support of Hovland's work in the UK. </p>

          <p>Finally, publication has been made possible by a second Insight grant to MacLean from
            the SSHRC and a Research Publications grant from Victoria College which supported REED
            staff work for this edition. </p>

            parish was formed in 1540, following the purchase at 400 marks of the large church of
            the Augustinian priory of St Mary Overie, dissolved in October 1539, by the parishioners
            of the small parishes of <rs ref="eats:234313" type="Place_PA_Settlement">St

            whom six were churchwardens. As with other parishes at this time, the positions went to
            the men of wealth and reputation resident in the parish.<note type="foot">In 1614 the

          <p>The reformed parish was large. It included Boroughside, part of the Gildable manor,
            which belonged to the Crown until its acquisition by the city of London in 1550.<note

            which was the most western part of the parish. Initially the property of the Templars,
            Paris Garden moved to the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem after their suppression. The
            manor was then acquired by the Crown on the Hospital’s dissolution in 1536.<note

            bishop of Winchester, <rs ref="eats:223826" type="Place_PA_Liberty">the Clink</rs>. This
            is the most significant manor for this study, for that is where the Bear Gardens of the
            sixteenth and seventeenth centuries lay. It extended from the western boundary of Paris
            Garden nearly to London Bridge on the east. where it bounded the Crown’s Gildable manor.
            It bordered the Thames on the north and included <rs ref="eats:229091"

            Priory of Stratford atte Bow. It included the Unicorn inn and tenements with houses and

          <p>Much of the manor of the Clink, like Southwark generally, was low lying, marshy, and
            prone to flooding. A network of ditches and sewers drained the area, originally dug in
            the thirteenth century and maintained by those who leased or owned the properties
            through which they ran. These were supervised by the manorial courts of the bishopric
            and a commission set up in 1554.<note type="foot">See Carlin, <title>Medieval
                Southwark</title>, p 36. The Sewer records are mostly held at the London
              Metropolitan Archives.</note>
            <rs ref="eats:229072" type="Place_F_Street">Bankside</rs> and Maid Lane were essentially

            by the common sewer and ditches bordering a marshy area known as ‘the Wilds.’ Maid Lane,
            its name suggesting the association of the lane with prostitution, was already named

            its walls, and in contrast its condoning by the manorial courts of the suburb. The city
            proclaimed at the end of the fourteenth century that prostitutes were to keep to the
            Stews in Southwark or Cock Lane in Smithfield. Brothels on Bankside numbered at least

          <p>A royal proclamation of April 1546 ordered the eviction by Easter of the prostitutes
            and keepers of the bawd houses, ‘whited and painted, with signes on the front,’ from the
            Stews on Bankside in Southwark. Moreover, to discourage those who might ‘resort’ to
            Bankside, it was ordered in the same proclamation that bearbaiting and its ‘accustomed
            assemblies’ in that ‘<rs ref="eats:229072" type="Place_F_Street">Rowe</rs>’ or in

            Mason stairs on Bankside. We do not, however, have a location for this venue determined
            by archaeology and moreover no further concrete documentary evidence. Braines in his
              <title>Globe Playhouse</title> included a well-researched appendix on ‘The Sites of
            the Southwark Bear Gardens.’ There he did note, as a tentative reference to bearbaiting
            near Mason Stairs, the answer of Gilbert Rocket (the younger) in a case in Chancery in
            January 1604/5. This was to the effect that his uncle, also Gilbert Rocket, in around
            1588–9 had possession of lands of John Gibbons mainly in the vicinity of Mason Stairs
            and Moses Alley or on Bankside but ‘also of and in one howse Called a Beare howse with

          <p>To the west of Mason Stairs lay <rs ref="eats:340267" type="Place_F_Other">Paris Garden
              stairs</rs>. In some contemporary literary sources, the manor of Paris or 'Parish'
            Garden was an early venue for bearbaiting. A poem by Robert Crowley in 1550, for
            example, declaimed the profit to be made each Sunday for the bearwards ‘At Paryse
              Garden.’<note type="foot">See Appendix 3, <ptr target="#bghop-ridm95891416"/>.</note>
            Kingsford, however, in 1920 effectively demolished the association of any site in Paris
            Garden with bearbaiting, affirming instead its association with Bankside.<note
              type="foot">Kingsford, ‘Paris Garden and the Bearbaiting,’ pp 155–63.; Mackinder and
              Blatherwick, <title>Bankside</title>, p 21, point out that there is no cartographic
              evidence of animal-baiting structures in Paris Garden.</note></p>

          <p>Taylor situated the second bearbaiting place near Maid Lane by the corner of the Pike
            Garden. Braines concluded this was a reference to the <rs ref="eats:231751"
              type="Place_F_Property">Great Pike Garden</rs>, and that the bear yard or garden,
            named by him as <rs ref="eats:227855" type="Place_F_Arena">Bear Garden 2</rs>, was
            perhaps on a plot between there and land of the <rs ref="eats:345674"

                Playhouse</title>, pp 89–90.</note> Again, there is no further documentary evidence
            to confirm this as a site, but there were some suggestive archaeological excavations in
            1988. These did not reveal a structure that might have been a bearbaiting ring, but did
            find many dog bones (no date estimated) ‘possibly associated with mastiffs from a nearby
              ring.’<note type="foot">Julian Bowsher, <title>Shakespeare’s London Theatreland:

            unlikely, however, that John Taylor may have been referring to a site a little further
            east, on land also bordering Maid Lane which had been in the possession of the <rs

            mentioned are three tenants whom we know were associated with bearbaiting and who also

            April 1546. He was still described thus in 1555.<note type="foot">See <ptr

            listed in the survey as the tenant at &#163;8 per annum of a principal curtilage called

            in the court of Augmentations, he is assessed as liable for a half year’s rent of
            &#163;4 for the bear yard and its associated premises and 30s for the rent for a half
            year on the garden of the Unicorn Inn.<note type="foot">See <ptr

            referred to as the site of Allen’s tenancy and indeed the survey indicates that Peter
            Hunnye was Polsted’s tenant in the King’s Pike Garden in 1552–3. It seems possible,
            therefore, that a baiting-place was situated on Polsted’s lands between Maid Lane and
            Bankside, at a site south of the Unicorn Inn and its garden. This may have been Taylor’s
            second baiting-place.</p>

          <p>The garden which was ‘parcel of the old bear garden,’ had passed by 1590 into the use
            of the tenants of a bear yard on the adjacent Barge, Bell and Cock property.<note
              type="foot">See <ptr target="#bghop-ridp264914232"/>.</note> This yard was John
            Taylor’s third baiting-place, as cited in his deposition in 1620 and Braines’ Bear
            Garden 3: the Bear Garden of William Payne. On 6 March 1539/40, the bishop of
            Winchester, <rs ref="eats:139370" type="Person_Clergy">Stephen Gardiner</rs>, leased the
            Barge, Bell and Cock and related land to William Payne, and his wife <rs
              ref="eats:337302" type="Person_StatusOther">Joan</rs>. The original lease has not
            survived, but its details are quoted by Joan Payne in a deed of 1575.<note type="foot"
              >See <ptr target="#bghop-ridp258242728"/>.</note> They are cited again in a lease of
              1582.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#bghop-ridp258390808"/>.</note> It was written
            that the Barge, Bell and Cock, and its associated ground, lay against Bankside to the
            north, the kings highway, the <rs ref="eats:231694" type="Place_F_Property">Great
              Rose</rs> to the east, and the lands of Stratford Priory to the west. Then it
            extended, according to the quoted lease, southward to Maid Lane. This is inconsistent
            with what we understand regarding Polsted’s estate of the Great Rose, acquired from
            William Spence, that on the west it lay against the Barge and on the south against the
            garden late belonging to the Prioress of Stratford, and as far as Maid Lane. From this
            inconsistency, litigation arose in 1618 on the boundaries of the lands of the Crown and
            the bishopric of Winchester.<note type="foot">See TNA: E 326/12364, <ref

          <p>We do not have documentary evidence for how the estate of the Barge, Bell and Cock was
            used in the first two decades of Payne’s tenancy or in what manner it was then used for
            bearbaiting. Those references that we do have for those years, other than those for Bear
            Garden 2, do not distinguish a location. By the mid-1550s, however, Payne seems to have
            become a deputy of Cuthbert Vaughan, who was confirmed as master of Games, Pastimes and
            Sports, including Bears, Bulls, and Mastiff Dogs, in 1553.<note type="foot">For the

            fills a gap by telling us how he knew Payne as deputy or master of Bears and how, close
            by the house in which he and Joan lived, he had built a baiting place ‘in the outer

            go to John Malthouse and ask him to take her into his house as otherwise she did not
            know what to do or how to live. She moved there in June 1582 and died in December that

            of Requests to revenues raised from the lease of the Barge, Bell and Cock under Joan’s
            indenture with her and her parents. The defendants, John and Elizabeth’s stepfather,

          <p>Warram, Malthouse and White, as lease-holders from the Bishop of Winchester, were not
            involved in the management of the Bear Garden on their Barge, Bell and Cock property. On
            3 February 1572/3, it appears that William Payne, perhaps already failing in health, had

              ref="eats:340749" type="Person_StatusOther">William Napton</rs>, another London grocer
            and brother to John. He testified that Digges and Gape paid Wistowe &#163;100, and Gape
            and Napton stood surety for the payment of a further &#163;200. Napton was already in
            considerable debt, it seems, owing his brother William &#163;500 and some &#163;400 to
            Digges and Gape. The agreement was that John Napton, managing the Bear Garden, would
            repay them at &#163;4 a week out of the profits until all his debt was paid. By
            Christmas 1579, Napton was indeed in further financial trouble and, despite the
            indenture with Digges and Gape, on 23 December assigned the Bear Garden to the goldsmith
              <rs ref="eats:131384" type="Person_Commoner">Morgan Pope</rs>, possibly in return of a
            loan of &#163;120. When he failed to meet the repayments, Pope took possession of the

          <p>Napton, Digges, and Gape were none too pleased by this takeover. As Bowes was given a
            letter of attorney from Pope giving him possession, Napton was heard shouting from a
            window of his house in the Bear Garden: ‘Synce that poope hathe thus delt w<hi

              type="Person_Gentry">Walsingham</rs> to a master of the court of Requests that the

              council</rs>. Walsingham, appointed to deal with it, found in favour of Bowes, by
            which time Digges and Gape had raised an action of trespass against Bowes’ agent,
            William Glover, in the King’s Bench. We have not found any record of that case, but
            according to Walsingham, a verdict was at some point passed against Glover.<note
              type="foot">See <ptr target="#bghop-ridp265927496"/>.</note> By then Bowes, in January
            1583/4, had brought his bill of complaint against Digges and Gape to the court of
            Requests, and a month later the court ordered that his tenure was not to be interrupted
            in the meantime.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#bghop-ridp269518360"/>.</note> Quite
            how the case was resolved is unknown, but Morgan Pope remained holder of Bear Garden 3
            until around 1590. He appears in the records of the Sewers Commission until that date as
            responsible for the sewers and wharf there.<note type="foot">See <ref target="https://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/search/?facet_collectives_office_specific=352239&amp;start=0&amp;facet_people_named_p=131384">Surrey and Kent

            administration of Bear Garden 3 is uncertain. He does appear periodically in the reports
            of the Sewers Commissioners in the 1580s, his name linked with Pope, and as a prisoner
            in the <rs ref="eats:228426" type="Place_F_PlaceOfPunishment">Marshalsea</rs> in 1587,
            then hoping not to cut Pope’s nose but to resolve matters between them. He was living in
            Bull Head Alley in the Liberty of the Clink and Paris Garden in 1588 and died in August
            1590.<note type="foot"><ref target="https://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/search/?facet_collectives_office_specific=352239&amp;start=0&amp;facet_people_named_n=131481">See Surrey and Kent Commissioners for Sewers’ Court Minutes and

          <p>Edward Bowes, assignee of Pope, was certainly heavily involved in investment and then
            in management of the Bear Garden until at least the summer of 1584. He was assisted in
            his administration of the Bear Garden by William Glover, of course, and also by <rs
              ref="eats:336459" type="Person_StatusOther">William Cudworth</rs>, yeoman of Bears.
            These were busy and tumultuous years, as outlined in the <ref

          <p>From 1584–90 there is not much evidence of Bowes’ activities in the Bear Garden. There
            is a curious question addressed to the deponents for Digges and Gape in June 1584
            regarding whether Bowes had been seen in London since the suit against Glover in the
            Bench had begun. Neither <rs ref="eats:340649" type="Person_StatusOther">Thomas
              Sewall</rs> nor William Napton had seen him.<note type="foot"> See Interrogatories and

          <p>Sometime before April 1590, Pope seems to have assigned his lease to a man named <rs
              ref="eats:364077" type="Person_StatusOther">Hayes</rs>, whom so far we have not been
            able to trace. Alleyn had in his ‘wrightings’ a note of a poll deed made to Hayes by

            we find ordered to pull up his dog kennel standing over the sewer running by his bear
              garden.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#bghop-ridp268231432"/>.</note> Alleyn’s
            list of writings indicate the deeds that must have been sealed over the next few months:
            John Malthouse, holder of the head lease, must have confirmed Burnaby’s holding of the
            sub-lease; Ralph and Edward Bowes probably deputised him to bait bears in the Bear
            Garden. In addition, Thomas (and Isabel) Keyes confirmed a lease to Burnaby of some part
            of their lands held from the Crown, once Polsted’s lands including Bear Garden 2.<note

            per annum. The plot bordered the Bear Garden on the north, the <rs ref="eats:231960"
              type="Place_F_WaterFeature">common sewer</rs> on the south (Maid Lane), and the
            remainder of Watson's garden on the west. Burnaby would continue to fence it, as he had
            in the past, so that the dogs and bears there were contained. <note type="foot">See <ptr

          <p>Just over a month later, on 15 December 1590, Burnaby demised the Bear Garden and all
            its appurtenances, including the house Napton had lived in, the game and the dogs, and
            all the profits of the game to <rs ref="eats:339693" type="Person_StatusOther">Richard
              Reve</rs>, a citizen and glazier of London. Reve would be responsible for fees to

              annum.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#bghop-ridp265314616"/>; Burnaby may have
              continued to be involved in bearbaiting, if not in the immediate management of the
              Bear Garden itself. In Coventry in 1593–4, payments of 5s and 10s were registered to
              ‘Mr Burnabies Beareward’ in the account book of the Chamberlains and Wardens; see R.W.

            easy for Richard Reve. In August 1592 he was held responsible by the commissioners of
            the Sewers for accumulated fines of 35s on which Pope and Burnaby, and possibly Napton,
            had defaulted. He pleaded and was granted remittance of 25s on the grounds that he had
            been commanded to leave the Bear Garden and go with his game into the country.<note

          <p>In December 1594, Edward Alleyn bought the sub-lease of the Bear Garden at the Barge,
            Bell and Cock from Thomas Burnaby and held it for sixteen years: he and Philip Henslowe
            would become joint holders of the office of master of Bears, Bulls, and Mastiff dogs by
              1604.<note type="foot">For the acquisition of this office, and for activities at the
              Bear Gardens and Hope Playhouse and during their tenure, see the Introduction: History
              of Entertainment.</note> Before paying the first quarter’s rent, however, as he later
            claimed, he checked with John Malthouse, who held the lease of the Barge, Bell and Cock
            and the Bear Garden there from the bishop of Winchester, for which property he was
            paying &#163;8 per annum. Furthermore, he checked with Isabel and Thomas Keyes, to whom
            &#163;12 per annum was due, that this rent was indeed for the Crown lands of David
            Watson’s garden, and for the dog yard west of the Barge, Bell and Cock. Once he had
            confirmation, he claimed to have conveyed the interest of half the sublease from Burnaby
            to Philip Henslowe.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#bghop-ridp249419208"/> and <ref

            Malthouse regarding the ‘beargarden.’ This was the assignment to him of the head lease
            of the Bear Garden and related tenements on Bankside, for which he would pay the
            customary rental of 9s 7d for the year to the bishop of Winchester in 1601.<note
              type="foot">See <ptr target="#bghop-ridp269416648"/>; for the bargaining with
              Malthouse, see Foakes, <title>Henslowe's Diary</title>, pp 43, 48, 74.</note> In 1596
            he acquired from Livesey and Gore the interest and remaining term of the Unicorn
            messuages and tenements that had been held from the Crown first by Polsted and then by
            Isabel Keyes and Thomas Keyes.<note type="foot">See <ref

              date from Robert Livesey and Gerard Gore who had acquired the lease directly from the
              Crown since 11 October 1595; see LR 1/100, ff 261–1v.</note> These acquisitions by
            Henslowe and Alleyn were, of course, part of the consolidation of their property
            portfolios in St Saviour’s parish, but this rapid accumulation in one area on Bankside
            suggests also a newly focussed interest in commercial entertainment and in bear
              baiting.<note type="foot">For more information on the history of Henslowe’s
              acquisition of property in St Saviour’s, see Greg, <title>Diary</title>, vol 2, pp

          <p>In February 1609/10 Alleyn sold the interest in Bear Garden that he had bought from

                target="#bghop-ridp265235096"/>.</note> A year later, they made an agreement that in

              playhouse</rs> and its adjoining tenements, Alleyn could live, when in Southwark,
            rent-free for a term of twenty-four years in part of the ‘newe building<hi rend="italic"
              >es</hi> lately built’ at the Bear Garden, namely the gatehouse complex on Bankside
            begun by <rs ref="eats:342419" type="Person_StatusOther">Peter Street</rs> around
              1606.<note type="foot">See <ref

          <p>The new gatehouse was a prelude to the demolition of the Bear Garden arena and its
            related buildings, by then all showing dilapidation. In 1613 Henslowe and his partner
            Jacob Meade then built the new dual purpose Hope playhouse and bearbaiting arena with
            advice and input from Alleyn.<note type="foot">See the Introduction: History of
              Entertainment for further insight on the building of the Hope playhouse and bear
              baiting arena (the Bear Garden 4 of Braines).</note> Acquisition of additional land
            does not seem to have been necessary and, although there would be much dissension in the
            years following Henslowe’s death in 1616, it seems likely that the Hope was in fact
            built wholly on the Crown property south-east of the previous Bear Garden on the
            property of the bishopric of Winchester. As well as the new playhouse/bearbaiting arena,
            and the recently built gatehouse, the whole precinct included a new bull house, a house
            for young bears and another for white bears, a stable, and a hay house built on the old

            died by 1615, as had the sons of Richard, the eldest of the Henslowe brothers, but his
            younger brother <rs ref="eats:202826" type="Person_StatusOther">William</rs> and his two

              ref="eats:349842" type="Person_StatusOther">Philip</rs>, and a daughter Elizabeth. The
            will determined that Agnes should have all Henslowe’s lands, tenements, hereditaments,

            her and her heir, namely <rs ref="eats:202177" type="Person_Commoner">Joan</rs>, wife of

            lands in the Great Pike Garden bought from Henry Throgmorton. Finally, his brother
            William and his assigns would receive, on the death of Agnes, ‘all that my messuage

            No other leases were mentioned by that will: not the interest and term of years of the
            Unicorn properties he had acquired from Livesey and Gore’s in 1596, not those lands and
            gardens on which some of the dog yards had been built, and crucially on which the
            dual-purpose Hope playhouse and bear baiting arena lay. Moreover, there were no other
            beneficiaries except for a gown for each of forty poor men of the liberty of the Clink,
            and 40s for James Archer to preach at Henslowe’s funeral. His nephew, <rs

                <title>Memoirs</title>, pp 123–6.</note> The substance of John Henslowe’s bill of
            complaint was that Alleyn had conspired with Roger Cole to <rs ref="eats:202471"
              type="CrimesMisdemeanors">draft and write a new will</rs> while Philip lay on his
            death bed, thus settling the bulk of Philip’s estate, which he estimated as worth
            &#163;10,000–12,000, on Agnes, his executrix, for life. This will, John maintained,
            replaced a former will made largely in his favour. Alleyn, he charged, had initiated
            this in the knowledge that the feeble Agnes would be unable to manage the estate and,
            through his position as her son-in-law, its management would naturally pass to him.
            Further, the will had been drawn up when Philip was ‘past all sence &amp; vnderstanding’
            and only able to cry ‘Noe Will Noe Will’ when the will was read to him. Alleyn had then
            attempted to guide Philip’s palsied hand in the signing of the will, until dissuaded,
            and Philip, quite able to write his name when well, had thus inscribed only a mark.
            Alleyn, moreover, had drawn up the clause regarding forfeitures. Probate was then rushed
            through the morning after Henslowe’s death even though it was the sabbath.</p>

          <p>The answer to John Henslowe’s bill of complaint to Chancery had been given by Alleyn
            and the defendants by 5 February, though it was deemed to be insufficient both then and
            on 30 April 1616 by Master <rs ref="eats:348885" type="Person_StatusOther">Richard
              Moore</rs>.<note type="foot">See <ref

                >Appendix 4: I</ref>. a., c.<!--#IN link "c" to BHMRHH-->.</note> According to the
            breviates, the defendants denied all confederacy, or that Philip had made any other
            will. They maintained that Philip had often said that he did not love John, who had
            behaved badly towards him, and that he should never be the better for anything of his
            and never have a penny of his goods. On the other hand, he claimed his gratitude to
            Agnes, to whom he had been a servant before they married, and said he owed the greatest
            part of his advancement to her and had often promised to make amends to her if he should
            die before her. Philip, they said, had been of sound mind and perfect memory, despite
            his illness and palsy. On 5 January he had himself given the verbal instructions to
            Roger Cole for the draft of the will, which Roger had performed observing the true
            meaning of the instructions, saving that the overseers had thought it best on 6 January
            to add the clause referring any doubts and controversies to the overseers. Philip had
            then and of his own initiative, made Alleyn rather than Agnes, whom he described to the
            room as an old and feeble woman, the beneficiary of forfeited legacies. He said Alleyn
            would curb intransigents better. Philip also himself called for the pen and ink to make
            his mark. The estate had been valued by appraisers at merely &#163;1700 12s 8d, and
            probate was rushed as the defendants despaired of Agnes’s life as she was so sick and
              weak.<note type="foot">DC: MS V, ff 40–3; Collier, <title>Memoirs</title>, pp
              123–6.</note></p>

          <p>Perhaps until around the date of the Master Richard Moore’s report of 30 April 1616,
            the administration of Henslowe’s estate by the widowed Agnes Henslowe and by Alleyn and
            perhaps the other overseers continued relatively smoothly. The inventory of Henslowe’s
            estate was presented to the Prerogative Court of Canterbury around April.<note
              type="foot">See Honigman and Brock, <title>Playhouse Wills</title>, p 103, citing TNA
              PROB 8/16 f 106v.</note> Jacob continued in management, now paying to Agnes the
            &#163;100 rent for the Bear Gardens/Hope while Alleyn, of course, retained his position
            as master of Bears, Bulls, and Mastiff Dogs alone.<note type="foot"><ref

              3<!--#IN link to BHCCHH-->.</note> Alleyn also took on the wider role that Philip
            Henslowe had taken in his partnership with Meade. Thus it was he and Meade who agreed on
            20 March 1615/16 to the discharge of a debt to Philip Henslowe with the <rs

          <p>With the case proceeding in Chancery, however, the transition could not be smooth. On
            23 April, the Chancery Court allowed John to take out an order of <hi rend="italic"
              >Subpena ducens tecum</hi>, to the effect that Alleyn should bring into the court the
            will and its associated drafts and also the documents concerning Philip Henslowe’s lands
            and leases. Moreover, the court would consider a sequestration of the rents and profits
            of Philip’s lands, including those of the Bear Gardens/Hope.<note type="foot">See <ref

            Alleyn’s counsel may have argued that until the will might be overturned, the rents and
            profits were rightfully due to Agnes.<note type="foot">DC: MS V, f 43.</note> In due
            course, however, Alleyn did produce the will, together with its drafts, and these were
            held by the court with the allowance that they might be produced for the use of the
            examiner taking depositions, and then returned to the court.<note type="foot"><ref

                >Appendix 4: I</ref>. d.</note> There was some uncertainty over whether all deeds
            and leases had been produced. On 17 June John Henslowe swore an affidavit that four
            leases held by Philip and mentioned in the inventory had not been produced.<note
              type="foot">DC: Muniments 1, 53. Three of the leases to Philip Henslowe related to
              half the Fortune Playhouse and associated tenements and were from Leonard Bilson,
              James Russell, and Edward Alleyn. They are possibly the leases that were mentioned in
              an unexecuted assignment by Agnes Henslowe, February 1615/16.</note> The remaining
            lease, John said, was held from the Crown and bought from Thomas Keyes, so it may have
            been for part of the property on which the Hope was built. By October 1616 Alleyn had
            been charged with contempt of court over the alleged failure to produce all Philip’s
            leases and associated evidences, and on 15 October he was threatened with imprisonment
            in the Fleet if he did not appear to be examined by the following Saturday.<note

            October was about the assignment from John Malthouse to Burnaby of a lease from the

            and Cock.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#bghop-ridp247150440"/>.</note> He deposed
            on that day that he had produced all that he had then in his possession concerning
            Philip’s estate at the beginning of the preceding May. He added that he could not call
            to mind all that had been in his possession without perusing what he had given to the
            usher of the court and added (with a touch of asperity?) that he did not think John
            intended that he should declare all the petty leases, bonds, and legal instruments that
            had been part of Phillip Henslowe’s estate.<note type="foot">See <ref

          <p>The gathering of evidence on the question of the validity of Philip Henslowe’s will
            continued alongside the charge of contempt. Between May and June 1616 twelve deponents
            were called to answer interrogatories on behalf of the plaintiff John, with a further
            four called in October.<note type="foot">See <ref

                >Appendix 4: I</ref>. f, interrogatories<!--#IN
              link to BHJHAH-->.</note> Questions concerned Philip’s family, and who
            might be his heirs, the relationship between him and John, the health of Agnes, the
            progress of his last days, the circumstances of writing and witnessing of his will, and
            the value of his estate. The ‘Bearegarden and playhouse’ were mentioned specifically in
            only one interrogatory (no 12), where deponents were asked whether during Philip’s last
            illness, or any other time, they had heard that these leases would be left to William
            and when he should receive their benefit and profit. <rs ref="eats:349049"
              type="Person_StatusOther">Ferrers</rs> and Meade agreed that they had at some time
            heard Philip name William as a beneficiary of the leases but did not know when he would
            receive them. <rs ref="eats:348946" type="Person_StatusOther">Robert Bromfield</rs>
            verified it would be after the death of Agnes. Meade had some very limited evidence of
            the extent and value of Philip’s estate, citing rent to Agnes Henslowe for the Bear
            Garden and one George Angell’s rent of &#163;30 a year. He estimated the value of the
            bears, <rs ref="eats:357316" type="Entertainer_Type">bulls</rs>, and other livestock at
            &#163;50 annually but did not know the value of the players’ apparel.<note type="foot"

            Philip’s estate and goods may have been one reason for the addition of two further
            interrogatories. These were added on a slip four months after the first batch of
            depositions had been taken. One of these concerned the value and appraisal of Henslowe’s
            leases and goods, including bears and players’ apparel.<note type="foot">See <ref
                target="https://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/collections/bghop/appendix-4/#bghop-app4-i"
                >Appendix 4: 1</ref>. f, interrogatory 23.</note> It was answered by two appraisers
            of Henslowe’s will, <rs ref="eats:341995" type="Person_StatusOther">Edward Griffen</rs>
            and <rs ref="eats:354941" type="Person_StatusOther">John Pickett</rs>, and by a keeper
            of the players’ apparel, <rs ref="eats:348543" type="Person_StatusOther">Randall
              Wood</rs>. It is interesting that they were examined on 15 and 16 October, immediately
            before Alleyn answered his examiners on the charge of contempt of court on 17 October.
            Both these appraisers reported that they had not seen any original leases but had
            accepted appraiser <rs ref="eats:349770" type="Person_StatusOther">Gilbert East’s</rs>
            description of the leases, and from whom Henslowe had acquired each and at what
              price.<note type="foot"> Gilbert East was a bailiff of Philip; see Foakes (ed),
                <title>Henslowe’s Diary</title>, pp 192–3, 245.</note> They also said that Alleyn
            had produced a book in which Philip Henslowe had entered what every lease had cost him
            and from whom he bought them. Since that book agreed with East’s report, they accepted
            both it and the report at face value. Both verified they had not valued any bears,
            bulls, or hogs, or players’ apparel, as none were presented. So their valuation of
            Henslowe’s estate based on what they did see at that time was apparently around
            &#163;1700, the same kind of sum given by Alleyn in his answer to John Henslowe’s bill,
            but very different from the valuation of over &#163;12,000 suggested by John in his
            bill. Pickett deposed that afterward he and <rs ref="eats:342061"
              type="Person_StatusOther">Daborne</rs> had appraised apparel to the value of &#163;44.
            Randall Wood, too, testified that he saw appraised players apparel worth around &#163;43
            or &#163;44, but also remarked that one trunk of apparel was never brought to be
            appraised but was, he thought, now in Alleyn’s possession.<note type="foot">See <ref

          <p>Deponents on behalf of Alleyn, Agnes, and Roger Cole were called between August and
            November 1616. William Henslowe, the Bear Garden and other leases and the players’
            apparel received no mention. Edward Griffen deposed in August but gave no details of the
            inventory, stating here too the valuation &#163;1700 12s 8d, with the caution that
            &#163;400 of that was desperate debts. It seems that the defendants’ principal concerns
            were to prove that Philip was sound of mind, if weak in body, when he dictated and
            sealed his will in his last two days, and to demonstrate the deterioration of the
            relationship between John Henslowe and Philip in the years before his death. Loyal women
            servants of Philip, who knew both Philip and Alleyn well and had helped nurse Philip in
            his last illness, testified to the history of the relationship between him and John. <rs
              ref="eats:344542" type="Person_StatusOther">Joan Horton</rs>, Philip’s charwoman,
            described an incalcitrant nephew and ward who, apprenticed first to a dyer, and then a
            waterman, did not ‘tarrye in service,’ putting Philip to ‘great trouble, greef and
            vexation of mynd.’ She added that later he had taken his uncle to court, thus causing
            ‘much unkyndness betweene them.’ When John came to see Phillip Henslowe in his last
            illness Philip turned away, saying ‘A, John, Thou hast done me wronge and it sicketh to
            my stomache,’ Jacob Meade, too, said Philip had ‘a very hard conceipt of John’ and vowed
            he should ‘never have a foote of the Land or a peny worth of the Goods’ for John
            Henslowe had ‘wronged’ him and should never be his heir.<note type="foot">TNA C

          <p>Over the following three months, two Chancery masters considered the evidence, and in
            session on 7 February 1616/17 decided the question at issue was whether Philip’s will of
            6 January was valid and should therefore more suitably be settled at Common law. In the
            meantime, they ordered, Philip’s estate should not be distributed in a manner contrary
            to his will of 6 January and was retained in the hands of Agnes (and Alleyn). On the 20
            June, John Henslowe’s case was dismissed from Chancery, with costs of &#163;3 awarded to
            Alleyn for his vexation.<note type="foot">See <ref

            Joan, Alleyn’s wife, being her main beneficiary. Agnes was buried in Dulwich College
            Chapel on 9 April 1617 but her will did not receive full probate by sentence until 3
            July 1617.<note type="foot">See Honigman and Brock, <title>Playhouse Wills</title>, pp
              104–5, for an abstract of Agnes’s will, and other notes that probate was by sentence
              on 3 July 1617. In that sentence Joan was the promoter versus William Henslowe, who
              was cited thus as the person likely to challenge the will. For an explanation of
              probate by sentence, see <title>Playhouse Wills</title>, pp 23–4.</note> Probably soon
            after Agnes’s death, William Henslowe moved into occupation of the Hope playhouse, Bear
            Garden, and associated properties. On 29 June he and Jacob Meade – who always, as
            Cerasano writes, ‘tried to shuttle from side to side’ – apparently signed an indenture
            demising the Bear Garden and related properties to Meade including, as they thought, the
            Hope for 21 years at &#163;100 per annum. The indenture does not seem to have survived.
            William, on his part, acquitted Meade from all legal actions that might be brought by
            anyone, especially Edward Alleyn or John Henslowe. They exchanged bonds of

              implicated as co-conspirators several of the deponents who had been examined in

            <p>Jacob Meade, still managing the Bear Gardens/Hope with William Henslowe, was also
              embroiled in this multi-faceted dispute with Alleyn and the two Henslowe brothers.
              Sometime after he and William signed their agreement on 29 June 1617, he seems to have
              petitioned <rs ref="eats:22120" type="Person_Male">William Herbert</rs>, earl of
              Pembroke and the lord chamberlain of the Household, who was then in Edinburgh with the
              King, complaining that Alleyn was interrupting and interfering with his assigned right
              to the baiting and keeping of the game in the Bear Gardens. We know this, and have an
              idea of the content, not from Meade’s petition, which has not been found, but from
              notes and a drafted response made by Alleyn. Alleyn intended to complain that Meade
              had not been paying rent to Alleyn, nor allowing an annual return of &#163;60 for use
              of his commission as master of the Game. They also disagreed, it seems, over the value
              of stock.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#bghop-ridp267949800"/>.</note></p>

            <p>In mid-September 1617, as a Walter Heynes later affirmed, John Henslowe died.<note

                Edward Alleyn; Alleyn paid him 4d for costs regarding an affidavit on 20 December

              This must have had an impact on the case in Star Chamber but we do not have the court
              proceedings that enable us to trace the case. At some time in the following weeks,
              however, William Henslowe presented a petition to Chancery directed solely against
              Edward Alleyn. This may have been shortly before 28 October 1617 as, on that date,
              Alleyn noted that he had paid 1s 6d for copying a petition of William’s.<note

              An entry in Chancery’s Book of Decrees and Orders, dated 17 November 1617, summarizes
              the complaint. Essentially, the case was the same as those presented by John Henslowe
              in January 1615/16, and to Star Chamber a year later, but stressed William’s claim to
              be heir as Philip’s only surviving brother. Alleyn, charged William, had persuaded the
              dying Philip to form a new will, while concealing an older one in William’s favour. He
              had then manipulated Agnes, again described as a silly old woman, thus contriving to
              get possession of goods, leases, and deeds worth &#163;14,000.<note type="foot">See

              trial at Common Law. There is no further answer recorded from William.<note

            <p>The following spring, probably in early May 1618, nearly a year after William had
              taken possession of the Bear Gardens/Hope, an information was raised in the Exchequer

              initiated by a private individual, like Alleyn, with for a fee the lodging of an
              ‘information’ and under the name of the attorney general, was a device used from the
              mid-sixteenth century in the Exchequer and in Chancery or Star Chamber. Informations
              could be ‘indistinguishable from private-plaintiff bills’ and the extent of the actual
              involvement of the attorney-general could be minimal. The relator paid all the court
              fees and costs of counsel but could receive a share of any fines if the suit was
              successful. To the relator’s advantage, and thanks to the prerogatives of the attorney
              general, the case might be heard more quickly, with certain court procedures and
              timelines bypassed.<note type="foot">See Kadens, ‘New Light,’ pp 53–4, and nn 382–7,

              copy of a survey of Henry Polsted's lands, and 2s 8d for a copy of its demise. On 8

                meetings with Alleyn are also listed, but records in this collection describe him as
                a gentleman.</note> The information charged William, and Jacob Meade, with
              non-payment of rent owing to the King and his lessees following their occupation of
              those parts of Philip Henslowe’s Bear Garden that were not on land of the bishopric of
              Winchester at the Barge, Bell and Cock on Bankside, but on the Crown land (once leased
              to Polsted) demised to Philip in 1595–6, and on which the Hope playhouse and
              bearbaiting arena had been built. William and Meade were moreover charged with setting
              up false boundaries on Crown land, beyond the Hope. As well as setting out these
              charges, the defendants were instructed upon their oaths to discover and answer for
              the true boundaries and limits of the Crown lands, and to calculate how much
              accumulated rent in their custody was due to the King and how much to his
                lessees.<note type="foot">See <ref

            <p>William and Jacob Meade answered on 8 June 1618. William declared that he hoped to
              prove that Philip had intended him to inherit the whole of the property, including the
              Hope playhouse and bearbaiting arena, while Meade for his part denied that he knew if
              the Hope lay on Crown land. He asserted that he paid his rent to William, according to
              his lease, and that would be the case whether the lands he was occupying were those of
              the bishop of Winchester or the Crown. In addition, William professed to have been
              unable to find relevant records establishing the boundaries despite a diligent
                search.<note type="foot">See <ref

                  >Appendix 4: V</ref>. b). On 13 June Alleyn recorded a payment of 12s 8d for a

              The replication in the name of the attorney general denied William’s claim to the

              validity of the will.<note type="foot">See <ref

            <p>Following William’s professed inability to find records, the court ordered on 20 June
              with the consent of both parties that a commission survey the lands in question, as
              conveyed to Polsted. Letters patent were issued five days later. Lionel Tichborne
              (Tichbourne) was commissioned, as was Robert Bromfield, a close associate of Alleyn in
              the parish of Saint Saviour and one of Philip Henslowe’s overseers.<note type="foot"

            <p>We do not have records that reveal how the Bear Gardens/Hope was being managed while
              this case progressed through the court. Thus we can only assume that William Henslowe
              and Jacob Meade continued as they had done after the death of Agnes Henslowe, with
              Alleyn, of course, still master of Bears, Bulls, and Mastiff Dogs. What is apparent,
              however, is that over the winter of 1618–19, Alleyn sought rapprochement with William
              Henslowe. On 24 October they met and sealed a bond of a &#163;1000 to stand to an
              award, perhaps to the proceedings in commission. In November they met with Sir Edmund
              Bowyer and <rs ref="eats:147619" type="Person_Commoner">Sir Thomas Grymes</rs>,
              possibly for arbitration. Then began a series of shared drinks and dinners.<note

              The culmination was on the 1 March 1618/19, when Alleyn wrote in his diary, ‘On this

              the writing was that Alleyn granted for life, at &#163;20 per annum, parts of the Bear

              What this suit was we do not know, unless it was concerned with the recorded dispute
              between them concerning Alleyn’s tenancy of a house he had occupied within the Bear
              Garden, rent free, under an agreement made with Philip Henslowe in 1610–11.<note

              however, Alleyn now turned his attention to his volatile relationship with Jacob
              Meade. Thus we find that Alleyn rode to London to meet Jacob on 25 April and spent 7s
              at dinner with the arbitrators. In July he paid Mr Adye 10s for advice about Jacob. On
              22 September 1619 he settled with Jacob, however temporarily, writing in his Diary
              ‘blessed be ye god of peac.’<note type="foot">See See Ioppolo, <ref target="https://henslowe-alleyn.org.uk/catalogue/mss-9/"><title>Henslowe-Alleyn

            <p>These negotiations between the three parties seem to have been independent of the
              proceedings in the Exchequer. Perhaps they indicate the pressure that William and
              Jacob Meade were under. By 4 June 1619 an order in the court stated that the
              commission had not yet been executed. On the same day, Alleyn recorded in his diary
              that he had paid Sir John Jackson &#163;1 2s for a motion to have the commission

              On 12 June William and Jacob Meade, perhaps trying to detach themselves from the
              issue, through their counsel pleaded their inability as mere tenants of the bishop of
              Winchester to verify the boundaries of the Bear Garden and Hope playhouse, and
              requested that the bishop himself should appear to answer the bill and satisfy the

                  >Appendix 4: VIII. a</ref>.</note> Alleyn held that Jacob Meade was raising a
              petition based on effectively the same grounds and involving the same witnesses as the
              case still pending in the Exchequer in the name of the attorney general. Meade had
              asserted in his plea that Philip Henslowe in his will had meant William to inherit not
              only the lease from the bishop of Winchester of that part of the Bear Garden at the
              Barge, Bell and Cock, but also the lease of the Crown land on which the bear-baiting
              ring now stood. William had therefore, as he claimed, conveyed both properties to
              Meade in 1617 and Meade had paid his rent to him alone. In addition, however, Meade
              charged Alleyn of having conspired with William to make the above-mentioned secret
              agreement, their writing of peace, to the end that while William might occupy the
              properties leased from the Crown for the term of his life, Alleyn could claim
              ownership on William’s death. Alleyn had therefore, said Meade, duly claimed title on
              William’s death and had since then taken most of the profit into his own hands. Meade
              claimed to have spent &#163;400 on building and repairs to the Hope and was therefore
              struggling financially.<note type="foot">See <ref

              turned on the question of the inability of his estate to satisfy the bond of &#163;500
              that William and Meade had apparently signed in 1617 to protect Meade against any
              actions imposed on him by Alleyn, or any interest or title Alleyn might claim on the
              income or property managed by Meade. This inability, Meade said, was the result of a
              secret and deceitful conveyance of the bulk of William’s lands and property and goods
              to Elizabeth and Mary Mousehurst in exchange for maintenance and perhaps a lump sum.
              In their answer of 7 June, the Mousehursts denied that William was as wealthy in land
              or goods as Meade had estimated but was in debt and dependent on loans his
              stepdaughters had made him from their portions. Moreover, he had taken offense in
              dealings with his quarrelsome family, they said, and had accordingly rewritten his
              will in favour of his family by marriage and on the 13 November 1623 chosen to assign
              to them the remaining years of his lease of the Bear Garden held from the bishop of
                Winchester.<note type="foot">See <ref

            <p>Three weeks after the Mousehursts had given their answer, on 29 June 1624 Alleyn made
              his plea and demurrer. It seems that Meade was then, or shortly before, taken ill, as
              he made his will on 1 July, with a codicil added on the 4th. He was buried in St
              Saviour’s on 9 July.<note type="foot">See Honigman and Brock, <title>Playhouse

          <p>In his will, Alleyn had bequeathed to Dulwich College the remaining term of the leases
            of the Bear Garden, that is the lease of the Crown estates of the Unicorn and its
            associated messuages and tenements on which the bear baiting arena then lay, and his
            lease of the Barge, Bell and Cock, held from the Bishop of Winchester. The bequest was
            on condition that his cousins and executors, Matthias and Thomas Alleyn, then warden and
            master of the college, paid his second wife Constance the &#163;1500 Edward Alleyn had
            agreed to settle on her when they married in December 1623. He referred in his will to
            an earlier assignment of these leases he had made five months earlier on 20 June as a
            somewhat tardy security for the &#163;1500 settlement together with a statute or bond
            for &#163;2000. These were to Sir Thomas Grymes (Crimes), and Sir Nicholas Carew,
            sons-in-law of Constance’s grandfather, George More of Loseley.<note type="foot">See

            Alleyn sometime after 24 January 1624/5 told how Grymes had been present at the house of
            John Donne, Constance’s father, on 21 October 1623 for marriage negotiations. At that
            time, the security for money Alleyn was to settle on Constance had been leases of the
            manor of Lewisham and of tenements at Blackfriars.<note type="foot">DC: MS III, 102 ff
              1–2.</note> According to Young, Alleyn had been involved in prolonged lawsuits
            regarding these properties at the time. Eventually, under pressure from Constance’s
            family, he had assigned his leases of the Bear Garden properties instead.<note

            popularity of animal sports by the sixteenth century; the attempted combination with
            professional playhouse performances initiated by <rs ref="eats:129736"
              type="Person_Commoner">Philip Henslowe</rs> at the <rs ref="eats:227893"

            closure and demolition of such venues during the Interregnum.</p>

          <p>Some may have railed against bearbaitings at the time, but for at least three decades
            that was the main game on the south bank, and likely a lucrative one too. Much of the
            audience may have come across the river by ferry or on foot but there was also a long
            string of inns along the high street of <rs ref="eats:36966" type="Place_PA_Settlement"
              >Southwark</rs> leading to London Bridge, including the famous Tabard where Chaucer’s
            pilgrims gathered before their trek to Canterbury. Although the records and literary
            allusions to bearbaiting in Southwark do not begin until the mid-sixteenth century,
            there is plenty of earlier evidence in the provinces for royal and noble patronage of
            touring bearwards and their bears by the second half of the fifteenth century. Some of
            the northern earls and the Yorkist kings in particular seem to have had an appetite for
            this type of spectacle which evidently found popular audiences on the road beyond their
            own private residences.<note type="foot">See for example, the bearward of Richard
              Neville, sixteenth earl of Warwick, on tour in Kent in 1465 and 1470 (<ref

          <p>The first authoritative record of bearbaiting on Bankside comes from a royal
            proclamation on 13 April 1546, primarily directed towards the suppression of the
            brothels that had helped to establish the south bank of the Thames as an illicit
            attraction for medieval Londoners.<note type="foot">J.P. Collier's claim that the earl

          <p>There is an oft-quoted eyewitness account of the varied animal sports already on offer
            in this period both for local Londoners and, in this case, a continental visitor. In
            1544 a Spanish nobleman, Don Manriquez de Lara, third duke of N&#225;jera (1504–57/8),
            visited the English court. Among the hospitable amusements described by his secretary,
            who wrote the account, was a trip to 'an inclosure', possibly an arena of some sort on
            the south bank, where bearbaiting was much enjoyed:</p>

          <quote type="block"><p>In another part of the city we saw seven bears, some of them of a
              great size. They are led out every day to an inclosure, where being tied with a long
              rope, large and intrepid dogs are thrown to them, in order that they may bite, and
              make them furious. It is no bad sport to see them fight, and the assaults they give
              each other. To each of the large bears are matched three or four dogs, which sometimes
              get the better, and sometimes are worsted, for besides the fierceness and great
              strength of the bears to defend themselves with their teeth, they hug the dogs with
              their paws so tightly, that, unless the masters came to assist them, they would be
              strangled by such soft embraces. Into the same place they brought a pony with an ape
              fastened on its back, and to see the animal kicking amongst the dogs, with the screams
              of the ape, beholding the curs hanging from the ears and neck of the pony, is very
                laughable.'<note type="foot">The translation from the Spanish original was published
                by Frederic Madden, 'Narrative of the Visit of the Duke of N&#225;jera to England,
                in the year 1443–4,' <title>Archaeologia</title> 23 (1831), 354–5. The manuscript
                original is now BL: Add. MS 8,219.</note></p></quote>

          <p>There is pictorial evidence to corroborate such 'inclosures' in the mid-sixteenth
            century, though the earliest, in a <hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1560 copperplate map of the
            Bankside area, has not survived. Instead we have a later version of the original,
            commonly referred to as the 'Agas' map, which shows two arenas, labelled 'The bolle
            bayting' and 'The Bearebayting,' both approximately located in the Pike Gardens, also
            visible below.<note type="foot">The 'Agas' woodcut map has been dated 1633 but the view
              of London predates the 1570s when playhouses were first built in Newington and
              Middlesex. See further <title>Tudor London: A Map and a View</title>, Ann Saunders and
              John Schofield (eds), London Topographical Society, no 159 (London, 1901).</note>. We
            can assume that significant artistic license has been taken but it is certainly possible
            that two enclosures of some sort existed around that time in approximately the same
            area, perhaps those leased by <rs ref="eats:334932" type="Person_StatusOther">John
              Allen</rs> and <rs ref="eats:209632" type="Person_Commoner">William Payne</rs> in the
            1550s. Very little is known about either of these arenas, including their operators or
            their size, structure and permanence.</p>

          <p>According to Taylor, the third venue for animal baiting (designated by W.W. Braines as
              <rs ref="eats:227798" type="Place_F_Arena">Bear Garden no 3</rs>), was located at the
            south end of the <rs ref="eats:231770" type="Place_F_Property">Bell and Cock</rs>
            property on Bankside.<note type="foot">Excavations by the Museum of London Archaeology
              team in the early twenty-first century targeted the area at 27 Bear Wharf/ Riverside
              House and 20–22 New Globe Walk only so the discoveries relate to later Bear Gardens
              rather than the earliest two. See further Mackinder <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>,

              the first Bear Garden lay just north of today's Tate Modern gallery. W.W. Braines

          <p>In 1562 another continental visitor offered a description of one of these early Bear
            Gardens. On his journey to England in August of that year, a young Venetian merchant
            named Alessandro Magno noted in his journal a visit to Bankside where he observed pens
            for perhaps 200 dogs, bears, and bulls, and in their midst 'an open circular space
            surrounded by stands with their awnings for the sun and the rain, where every Sunday in
            the training of these dogs people find great entertainment.'<note type="foot">No
              systematic attempt has been made to survey all foreign and domestic eyewitness
              accounts during the period 1550–1642, but samples of some memorable reminiscences have
              been included in Appendix 3.</note> The charge at the entrance was one penny for
            standing and two pence for places in the stands. The baitings, which included a monkey
            on a horse, began at the vesper hour in the late afternoon (approximately 4pm) and
            continued into the evening.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#bghop-ridp265629144"

          <p>Only very occasional mishaps have surfaced on record in the first decades of Bankside
            bearbaiting, despite the potential for violence if the wild animals broke loose from
            their captors. In 1554 Henry Machyn noted an incident in his diary that ended in the
            death of a bystander, bitten on the leg by a blind bear on the run.<note type="foot">See
                <ptr target="#bghop-ridp257728344"/>.</note> While this may have caused some gossip
            at the time, there is no evidence of any other such consequences. Over two decades
            later, however, <rs ref="eats:131481" type="Person_Commoner">John Napton</rs>, an
            evident miscreant deputy keeper at Payne's Standings, was brought before the assizes for
            bearbaiting on the sabbath. He was also criticized for demanding large sums of money
            from spectators and allowing his bears and dogs to run amok amongst them, with some loss
            of life and undoubted trauma.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#bghop-ridp266195368"
              />.</note></p>

          <p>It is noteworthy, however, that the authorities did not appear to intervene or attempt
            to regulate this form of entertainment, popular as it was for all levels of society. For
            example, when the <rs ref="eats:351822" type="Collective_Office">privy council</rs>
            issued orders of restraint during the time of plague in 1574 and 1578, bearbaiting was
            not singled out for attention along with plays and players.<note type="foot">See TNA:
              PC2/10, p 285 (15 November) and PC2/12, pp 300, 348 (10 November and 23 December
              1578).</note> What roused official condemnation was the disastrous collapse of Payne's
            Standings at the third Bear Garden on Sunday, 13 January 1582/3. The first official
            notice comes in the <rs ref="eats:337186" type="Person_StatusOther">lord mayor</rs> of
            London's letter of 14 January to <rs ref="eats:130613" type="Person_Nobility">Lord
              Burghley</rs> regarding 'a greate mysshappe at Parise gardeine, where by ruyn of all

              >See <ptr target="#bghop-ridp265137720"/></note> The bearbaiting arenas were commonly
            referred to as Paris Garden, even though they were all located east of the manor.
            William Lambarde, for example, describing the habits of pleasure-seekers in the London
            area in 1570, refers to 'suche as goe to Parisgardein, the Bell Sauage, or some other
            suche common place, to beholde Beare bayting, Enterludes, or Fence playe.'<note
              type="foot"><title>A Perambulation of Kent</title> (London, 1576; <title>STC</title>:

            London arrived by water via the Paris Garden stairs along the river close to Bankside,
            resulting in the misleading name association.</p>

          <p>Burghley's letter in response picks up the mayor's interpretation of the event as the
            result of <rs ref="eats:45652" type="CrimesMisdemeanors">profaning</rs> the Sabbath, and
            encourages prohibition of such assemblies on the customary Sundays henceforth. Without
            ruling bearbaiting out entirely, he suggests that 'if it shalbe requisite to haue such
            like worldly pastimes I think some other daie within the weke meeter for those
              purposes.'<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#bghop-ridp265052680"/>.</note> The mayor
            followed up rapidly with an order to the <rs ref="eats:168618" type="Collective_Office"
              >aldermen of the city wards</rs> on 16 January, forbidding London residents to 'goe or

            However zealous his efforts, apparently the order did not have the desired impact: a
            subsequent letter to <rs ref="eats:121354" type="Person_Nobility">Sir Frances
              Walsingham</rs> expresses the lord mayor's ongoing frustration at the resort of people

          <p>The most vivid accounts of the disaster published the same year, with multiple
            reprintings, come from two Protestant writers, their disapproval unleashed by what was
            interpreted as an act of God. Philip Stubbes, in his <title>Anatomy of Abuses</title>,

            Garden:</p>

            with an entrance from the south side and adjacent buildings on the east side. An
            eyewitness description from the 1580s confirms that there were three galleries. In
            1584–5 a German nobleman from Pomerania named Lupold Von Wedel (1544–1615) visited
            England and Scotland, keeping a journal of his travels. On 23 August 1584 he described a
            visit to the rebuilt bearbaiting arena on Bankside, translated from the original as
            follows:</p>

          <quote type="block"><p>On the 23rd [of August] we went across the bridge to the
              above-mentioned town. There is a round building three stories high, in which are kept
              about a hundred large English dogs, with separate wooden kennels for each of them.
              These dogs were made to fight singly with three bears, the second bear being larger
              than the first, and the third larger than the second. After this a horse was brought
              in and chased by the dogs, and at last a bull, who defended himself bravely. The next
              was, that a number of men and women came forward from a separate compartment, dancing,
              conversing and fighting with each other: also a man who threw some white bread among
              the crowd, that scrambled for it. Right over the middle of the place a rose was fixed,
              this rose being set on fire by a rocket: suddenly lots of apples and pears fell out of
              it down upon the people standing below. Whilst the people were scrambling for the
              apples, some rockets were made to fall down upon them out of the rose, which caused a
              great fright but amused the spectators. After this, rockets and other fireworks came
              flying out of all corners, and that was the end of the play.<note type="foot">Lupold

          <p>The remains of this building have not been fully excavated although in 1996 a Museum of
            London Archaeology team did some initial work in the area. Most significantly, they
            identified a site named as 'Building 12' that may have been the rebuilt Bear Garden
            3:</p>

          <quote type="block"><p>Building 12 may have been a 12-sided polygon with a diameter of c
              16.0m (52ft 6in), smaller than the Rose playhouse (c 22.0m or 73ft) which was built
              some four years later. Although there is no evidence of the width of the galleries
              from which people would have watched a baiting, it would seem that the diameter of the
              baiting area itself would have been quite small -- a surrounding gallery width of 3.0m
              (10ft) would only have allowed a baiting area of about 10m (33ft). This would have
              been both an intimidating and exhilarating arena in which to watch animals being
              baited and one in which the safety of the spectaors could be regularly in doubt. The
              recovery of dog and horse bones -- albeit from undated contexts -- to the west of
              Building 12 may provide evidence of the documented pond for dead dogs, although
              evidence was not found of the pond itself.'<note type="foot">See further Mackinder and

          <p>Among the numerous property transactions documented in the Records and summarized in

            the bears, bulls, horse and ape (with their monetary values) that came with the
            property. Here is a rare glimpse of the performing <rs ref="eats:357374"
              type="Entertainer_Type">bears</rs> and bulls whose individual names suggest a cast
            list of sorts for this type of popular entertainment: 'one greate beare called harry of
            Tame,' worth &#163;8, 'one blacke Bull called Danyell,' worth &#163;4, 'one old she
            beare called Nan,' worth 30s, and so on. These animals were valuable assets and must
            have often gotten the better of the numerous mastiff dogs who were also part of the show
            but not listed in the 'scedule.' An earlier French eyewitness account, translated here,
            describes the action:</p>

          <quote type="block"><p>[O]ne can see there fights between large mastiffs and a bear, a
              bull, a frost-nailed horse and an ape. These are held after dinner on feast-days and
              sometimes during the week when there are fairs. I have sometimes seen 14 mastiffs at
              once set loose against a bear which, seizing six of them at a time, clenched them so
              hard between his arms that he suffocated two of them, the others being overjoyed to
              flee, with some difficulty, and not to return. The pleasure of a bull fight comes from
              when the bull is able to seize a mastiff (the mastiffs used in these fights are
              particularly big) using its horns; it throws the mastiff high up into the air and the
              mastiff, falling to the ground, either dies or breaks a limb, and so is no longer of
              any worth.<note type="foot">L. Grenade, <title>Les Singularitez de Londres, noble,

          <p>Such was the appeal of these spectacles that the privy council would move to protect
            the Bear Garden's monopoly on Sunday as the weekly date for entertainment there. As the
            number and popularity of playhouses increased, and with Henslowe's Rose opening in 1587
            virtually across a lane from the Bear Garden, there was competition to lure audiences
            elsewhere. As a result, in July 1591, the privy council directed the following complaint
            to the lord mayor and JPs of Middlesex and Surrey:</p>

          <p>This intervention provides evidence that a second customary day for bearbaiting had
            developed in recent years, so both Thursdays as well as Sundays were to be reserved for
            animal sports. When von Wedel visited the Bear Garden on 23 August 1584, the baiting was
            held on a Thursday. An otherwise undated (and very rare) bill survives in the
            Henslowe-Alleyn papers advertizing that 'a great match' at the Bear Garden was to be
            held on a Thursday.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#bghop-ridp269489592"/></note>
            However, surviving reports from foreign visitors suggest that other days may have
            allowed occasional openings.<note type="foot">See further Brownstein, 'Baiting,' p 248
              and n 60, and Chambers, <title>Elizabethan Stage</title>, vol 2, pp 455–7.</note>
            Further, royal pleasure in such entertainment ensured more protection by authorities
            than perhaps was the case for the sometimes controversial new theatre industry.<note
              type="foot">Numerous payments for baitings brought by the bearmasters to court survive
              in the accounts of the treasurer of the Chamber throughout the period; see further,
              David Cook (ed), <title>Collections</title> 4 (Oxford, 1962 for 1961), 10–25.</note>
            Such protection from the authorities did not extend to one year of severe plague,
            however. In January 1592/3 bearbaiting for the first time was not excluded from the list
            of prohibited entertainments known to draw the public assemblies prone to spreading
            infection.<note type="foot">See <ref target="https://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/records/rosep-ridm91625448/">Privy Council Letter to the Lord Mayor and JPs of Middlesex and Surrey, 1591</ref>.</note>
            Numerous further privy council orders attempting to control playhouses and their
            audiences followed between 1593/4 through 1605, including 1604, a year of severe plague,
            but bearbaiting was not singled out for restriction.<note type="foot">For privy council

          <p>It is possible that Richard Reve, deputy at the Bear Garden from 1590, may have also
            been impacted by the local crisis arising from the apprentices' riot in Southwark in
            June 1592. In August his name appears in the commissioner of sewers' reports, pleading
            incapacity to pay a fine outstanding from his predecessors:</p>

            special bearbaiting was requested by Frederick, duke of Wurttemberg.<note type="foot"

          <p>Unsurprisingly, records of profits made at the three Bear Gardens are mostly
            unavailable for the earliest decades of operation. Even speculation based on attendance
            once a week is futile as the number of spectators cannot be calculated from the few
            broad references that survive. As Brownstein summarizes: 'Baiting attendance figures are
            few, general, and of questionable authority. Crowley says that "two or three hundred"
            attended baitings in about 1550 ... John Field says that "above a thousand" were in the
            stands that collapsed in 1583.'<note type="foot">See Brownstein, 'Baiting', p 246, and

            Bear Garden rebuilt in 1583 had greater audience capacity and that its ongoing success

            playhouse nearby at the Rose in 1587: for a fuller discussion of his career see

            entertainment enterprise by acquiring the lease of the Bear Garden itself in 1594, and
            subsequently the lease of the Bell and Cock property and the adjacent Unicorn land where
            the dog yard and other buildings to house the bears and bulls were located.<note

            deputy in 1594 in order to take an active role in managing the bearbaiting on Bankside.
            He noted in his memorandum book the not inconsiderable cost of the Bear Garden lease as

          <p>Even as the Rose playhouse aged and was finally abandoned by 1605, Henslowe and Alleyn
            maintained their stake in the Bankside entertainment area. Although the focus of their
            theatrical investment shifted across the river to the new <rs ref="eats:63599"
              type="Place_F_Playhouse">Fortune playhouse</rs>, opened in 1600 in Finsbury just north
            of the city walls, they improved the Bear Garden site in 1606 by demolishing the old
            Bell and Cock building at its entrance to the north and erecting a new two and a half
            storey gatehouse which became known as the <rs ref="eats:237532"
              type="Place_F_VictuallingHouse">Dancing Bears</rs>. The building contract on 2 June
            1606 with Peter Street survives allowing a conjectural plan of the complex to be
              drawn.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#bghop-ridp268781320"/>.</note></p>

          <p>The plan illustrates the several purposes of the new building: a tenement, likely for
            the deputy bearward; a study or office to be used by Henslowe and Alleyn; and, as
            Lawrence and Godfrey suggest, ‘the greater part of the gatehouse proper, with its ample,
            well-lit spaces ... devoted to the purposes of a taphouse.’<note type="foot">See

            itself featured a large window projecting above, supported by two carved satyrs – an

            used even after the Bear Garden arena (3) on the site was demolished. The size of the
            weekly audiences remains unknown for this period but the type of entertainment offered
            at the Bear Garden was likely constant. It may be relevant to note here the rare
            survival of a playbill in the Henslowe-Alleyn archive advertising coming attractions for
            an undated event in the early seventeenth century:</p>

          <p>The traditional days of the week for bearbaiting were likely affected by the arrival of
              <rs ref="eats:17496" type="Person_Male">James I</rs> on the throne in 1603, as the

          <p>Certainly Edward Alleyn included the restraint on traditional Sunday baitings in a <hi
              rend="italic">c</hi> 1607 petition from Henslowe and himself to the king, seeking to
            reinforce their rights and fees as joint masters of the Bears, Bulls, and Mastiff Dogs,
            while also complaining of the high costs of acquiring the office from Sir William
            Stewart and loss of income from closures enforced during extended times of

              />.</note></p>

          <p>Although Henslowe noted play performances with dates and his share of the gate, whether
            at the Rose or the Fortune, for over a decade in his diary, the same accounting does not
            survive for the Bear Garden. There is only one slim record late in the manuscript that
            provides a glimpse of some special days sanctioned for opening, as well as his own
            profits taken, to be compared with the same days at the Fortune:</p>

          <p>The tradition of bearbaitings allowed on holidays apparently continued into the
            seventeenth century even if the old Sunday practice was officially discouraged. This
            rare piece of evidence also attests to the income that Henslowe and Alleyn must have
            enjoyed from their simultaneous operations at the Fortune north of the city and at the
            Bear Garden south of the river, and also suggests that at times there were better or at
            least comparable profits to be had at the Bear Garden.</p>

          <p>Alleyn's personal records also provide very occasional evidence of his income from the
            Bear Garden partnership. His memorandum book sums up the costs of his purchase of the
            Bear Garden from Thomas Burnaby in 1594 and of its sale to Philip Henslowe in 1610, with
            the estimate of his own annual income of &#163;60, or &#163;960 in total over the
            sixteen-year period of shared ownership.<note type="foot">See <ptr
                target="#bghop-ridp265235096"/>.</note></p>

          <p>Alleyn sold his share in the Bear Garden properties to Henslowe in February 1610/11,
            presumably to help fund his ambitious plans for the estate at <rs ref="eats:237554"

          <p>By 1613 it seems likely that Henslowe was again considering an innovative venture south
            of the river to complement the success of the Fortune Playhouse north of the city. His
            concept was for a multi-purpose entertainment centre with a removeable stage, that could
            mount weekly plays, animal baitings (at least bi-weekly), and other types of amusement
            such as <rs ref="eats:204281" type="Entertainment_Type">‘flytings,’</rs> in which
            contestants hurled scurrilous verse at each other. Whether his thinking was influenced
            by the disastrous fire that destroyed the <rs ref="eats:227836" type="Place_F_Playhouse"
              >Globe</rs> on 29 June that year cannot be proven but for some months at least there
            may seem to have been an opening for a new type of playhouse, to combine bearbaiting
            alternating with theatre in the same space.<note type="foot">Howes' continuation of
                <title>Stow's Annales</title> records the fire at the Globe while also noting the
              rapid rebuilding 'in far fairer manner then before' the following spring, 1614; see
              Stow, <title>Annales</title> (London, 1615; <title>STC</title>: 23338), p 926.</note>
            The <rs ref="eats:227779" type="Place_F_Playhouse">Swan playhouse</rs> in Paris Garden
            may still have been operating at times unrecorded but it was almost twenty years old and

            prestigious <rs ref="eats:17717" type="Collective_Troupe">King's Men</rs>.</p>

          <p>By late August 1613 Henslowe and Meade were ready to contract with the carpenter <rs
              ref="eats:341873" type="Person_StatusOther">Gilbert Katherens</rs> to demolish the
            former Bear Garden and one of its stables, and build a new playhouse, bull house, and
            stable on or near the same site. The building contract survives to provide precise
            details of the new construction, as well as note the influence of the Swan on its
            design:</p>

          <p>The three-storey polygonal building that became known as the Hope was to be constructed
            on a brick foundation using timber from the old Bear Garden and its stable, plus more
            purchased from a demolished property on Thames Street in London. It was to have a tiled
            roof, with a tiring house and a removable stage on tressles for plays that would also
            allow use of the space for baiting. A new bull house and stable were also contracted to
            replace the older structures. Later court cases reveal that the actual site of the
            playhouse was prudently moved slightly south of the old Bear Garden at the Bell and
            Cock, to a new location on the Unicorn property where the dog yard had been previously,
            so that it did not straddle property lines leased separately from the <rs

          <p>An illustrious artist's representation of this playhouse provides some visual clues
            about its appearance. In 1647 Wenceslaus Hollar published a finely etched panoramic
            'Long View' of London, based on work he had probably done earlier while resident in the
            city under the patronage of the earl of Arundel between 1636 and 1644. The Hope
            playhouse (mislabelled as 'The Globe') was depicted near the south bank of the Thames,
            with the Globe, nearby to the south-west, reverse-labelled as the 'Beere bayting.'<note
              type="foot">See further I.A. Shapiro, 'The Bankside Theatres: Early Engravings,'
                <title>Shakespeare Survey</title> 1 (1948), 34–5, and R.A. Foakes,
                <title>Illustrations of the English Stage 1580–1642</title> (Stanford, 1985), 37–8.
              Shapiro notes in a postscript that original sketches made by Hollar for the 'Long
              View,' presumably while he was still in London, do not include labels for the Globe
              and the Bear Garden, so these were probably added and confused at the time of etching
              in Antwerp in 1647; see <title>Illustrations</title>, p 37.</note></p>

          <p>One of the two exterior staircases adjoining the building can be seen at its southeast
            end but the other, and the entrance to the playhouse on the north side, are not in view.
            The stage clearly lacks the Globe's extensive gabled cover, in accordance with the Hope
            contract dictating that the Heavens were not to have support posts on the stage. Beyond
            this slight evidence, further details of the interior design of the stage are lacking.
            Whether it had two doors at the rear of the stage, as shown in the sketch of the Swan,
            or a central discovery space, remains the subject of speculation.<note type="foot">See,

          <p>The Hope, or Bear Garden 4 according to Braines, has not been fully excavated though
            'two short parallel and angled stretches of brick walls,' tentatively identified as the

          <p>While the playhouse was under construction Henslowe may also have been organizing a
            company for residence there, alongside the bears, bulls, and mastiff dogs. He had
            already involved himself with the <rs ref="eats:21924" type="Collective_Troupe">Lady
              Elizabeth's Men</rs>, a troupe initially licensed to perform on 27 April 1611.<note

                Companies</title>, pp 397–408, 412–15.</note> In March 1612/13 Henslowe apparently
            had a hand in the amalgamation of the adult company with the <rs ref="eats:356261"
              type="Collective_Troupe">Children of the Queen's Revels</rs>, led by <rs
              ref="eats:342877" type="Person_StatusOther">Philip Rosseter</rs>. However, a year
            later, in March 1613/14, further reorganization occurred, presumably in anticipation of
            the opening of the Hope. Articles of agreement between <rs ref="eats:204862"
              type="Person_Commoner">Nathan Field</rs>, now a lead actor of the company, and the
            Henslowe-Meade partnership survive, albeit in damaged form, to show the details of some
            of the management responsibilities involved: notably, for three years the partners
            committed to providing a playhouse or playhouses for the company, as well as a stock of
            playing apparel and props, whether the troupe was at home or on the road during times of
            official prohibition.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#bghop-ridp264604936"/>.</note>
            Apart from the agreement with Field on behalf of the troupe, there is another document
            of note during this period, as a bond between <rs ref="eats:342611"
              type="Person_StatusOther">Robert Dawes</rs> and Henslowe survives to witness to the
            terms of his engagement with Lady Elizabeth's Men in April 1614.<note type="foot">See
                <ptr target="#bghop-ridp249513592"/>.</note> From this very damaged record we learn
            the financial and contractual details of the three-year bond for Dawes' engagement; that
            plays were to start at 3pm on days of performance; and that Henslowe and Meade reserved
            one day in every four for the sport of bear and bullbaiting, for which they would take
            all profits.<note type="foot">Greg, <title>Documents</title>, p 125, n 60, thought that
              'fower' was likely an error for fourteen, the number given later by the players; see

          <p>The date of opening for the Hope cannot be confirmed though the building contract
            specified the goal of completion as 30 November 1613 and evidently the acting company
            was being reorganized in the spring of 1614. There is no mention, however, of the new
            playhouse in the prolific author/waterman <rs ref="eats:221802" type="Person_Male">John
              Taylor's</rs> account of the Watermen's petition to the king, which originated in

          <p>Within a short time, in 1615 Lady Elizabeth's men drew up 'Articles of Grievance'
            against Henslowe about the conditions of their arrangements at the dual-purpose
            playhouse, including a complaint that they had been shortchanged for ‘lying still one
            daie in forteene for his baytinge.'<note type="foot">See <ptr
                target="#bghop-ridp247753816"/></note> With the evident breakdown in the
            relationship, they left playing at the Hope, although the date of their departure
            remains uncertain. What is clear is that Henslowe and Meade then negotiated an
            arrangement with a newly amalgamated company with some actors from Lady Elizabeth's Men
            as well as new recruits from <rs ref="eats:356288" type="Collective_Troupe">Prince
              Charles' Men</rs>, presumably sometime in 1615.<note type="foot">For more details on

            residence at the playhouse was also destined to be brief and it was interrupted by
            Henslowe's death in January 1615/16.</p>

          <p>For almost a decade Henslowe's family and partnerships fell into disarray but it is
            worth noting that Edward Alleyn, also a man of influence and strategy, was well-placed
            as son-in-law to <rs ref="eats:344308" type="Person_StatusOther">Agnes Henslowe</rs> to
            inherit much of the estate left to her by her husband. Even as his building plans for
            the College of God's Gift at Dulwich, the Chapel, and twelve almshouses were
            progressing, he became immersed, as one of the defendents, in a Chancery Court case
            initiated by Henslowe's aggrieved nephew by 25 January 1615/16.<note type="foot">See
              TNA: C 33/129A, f 433 and ff.</note> By March he also assumed a role in negotiating
            the settlement of an outstanding debt owed to Henslowe by Prince Charles' Men at the
            Hope; with Jacob Meade, he agreed to settle their &#x00A3;400 debt peacefully for the
            sum of &#x00A3;200; see <ptr target="#bghop-ridp264768584"/>. During the same year,
            building at Dulwich was first completed on the Chapel, with its consecration on 1
            September by George Abbott, Archbishop of Canterbury.<note type="foot">See Ioppolo (ed),

          <p>Articles of agreement in March that year between Jacob Meade, Henslowe's partner in the

            Elizabeth's men as well as terms negotiated for the settlement of their debt of
            &#163;400 to Henslowe.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#bghop-ridp264768584"

          <p>With an agreement for the payment of half their debt, and the renewal of the terms of
            their previous bond with Henslowe and Meade, Prince Charles' Men recommitted to using
            the Hope as their performance base in the London area: but not for long. An undated
            letter, likely written later in 1616, from the players to Edward Alleyn, reveals that
            they had left Bankside. The reason for their departure was likely not the 'intemporate
            weather' at the playhouse (which did, however, lack a substantial cover over its
            removable stage), but conflict with Jacob Meade, who would have been responsible for the
            Hope's day-to-day operations, as a resident there and also as deputy for the ongoing
            bearbaiting operation on the site.<note type="foot">See <ptr
                target="#bghop-ridp265761784"/>.</note> Their plea was twofold: for another
            playhouse where they could fulfill their bond, and for money to tide them over until
            they received the 'great summe of monie' anticipated from court. Prince Charles' Men are
            known to have performed fourteen unnamed plays at court between October 1616 and January
            1616/17, so the reference may have been to the substantial payment anticipated for those
              entertainments.<note type="foot">See John H. Astington, <title>English Court Theatre

            Clerkenwell with help from Alleyn, thereby marking the end of Henslowe's attempt to run

          <p>From the outset, the conditions for playing alongside the bearbaiting operation must
            have been disagreeable, as Ben Jonson's 1614 induction to <title>Bartholomew
              Fair</title> reveals in a frequently cited passage: 'The play shall presently begin.
            And though the Fair be not kept in the same region that some here perhaps would have it,
            yet think that therein the author hath observed a speciall decorum, the place being as
            dirty as Smithfield, and as stinking euery whit.’<note type="foot">Jonson, 'Induction,'
                <title>Bartholomew Fair</title>, ll 116–20.</note></p>

          <p>Jonson's play is in fact the only one that can be identified with certainty for
            performance at the Hope. Although we know that popular Jacobean playwrights such as
            Beaumont, Dekker, Fletcher, Marston, and Massinger, as well as Nathan Field the player,
            wrote plays for Lady Elizabeth's Men in the second decade of the seventeenth century, no
            known record was kept by Henslowe for the repertory and profits at the Hope as he had
            done for the Rose and the Fortune.<note type="foot">For plays known to have been in
              their repertory at the time see Keenan, <title>Acting Companies</title>, pp 45–6, and

            random survival, apparently in Henslowe's hand, in a small memorandum book mostly kept
            by Alleyn during the 1614–15 period. Here appears a cryptic record of a few sums of
            money below an entry for a now lost play titled 'the noble grandchild,' presumably from
            the time when Henslowe was affiliated with both Lady Elizabeth's Men at the Hope and the
            Palsgrave's Men at the Fortune.<note type="foot">See Wiggins and Richardson (eds),
                <title>British Drama, Vol 6: 1609–1616</title>, no 1750. There is no entry yet for
              this play in the <title>Lost Plays Database</title>.</note> The fourteenth day of an
            unspecified month dates the performance, wherever it occurred but whether some or all of
            the 19s 8d total accounted for represents Henslowe's receipts from the event cannot be
              determined.<note type="foot">DC: MS I, f 2. See Ioppolo, <ref

            <title>A Fair Quarrel</title>, an extant tragicomedy by Middleton and Rowley, has also
            been attributed by Wiggins and Richardson to Prince Charles' Men during their brief

                1609–1616</title>, no 1798. Wiggins and Richardson also speculate that <title>The
                Night-Walkers</title>, an extant comedy written by John Fletcher between 1613 and
              1616 and later revised by James Shirley, may have been performed by Lady Elizabeth's
              Men in 1615 at the Hope; see <title>British Drama, vol 6: 1609–1616</title>, no. 1772.
              None of the plays associated with Prince Charles' Men in <title>British Drama, vol 7:
                1617–23</title> can be confidently assigned to 1617 while the troupe performed at
              the Hope. See Wiggins and Richardson, <title>British Drama, vol 7: 1617–23</title>,

          <p>There remain various communications between Henslowe and the playwright Robert Daborne,
            mostly from 1613, about personal loans and plays commissioned, but only the titles are
            known and no particulars of their actual performance.<note type="foot">See Ioppolo,

            time for the Hope's use as a playhouse was two to three years at most: the instability
            of the managers' relationship with the two companies involved must have affected
            sustained residency, and provincial touring by some of their members during the same
            period would have further complicated any regular schedule.<note type="foot">For

            has been sown by an anonymous commentator of dubious merit, who added handwritten notes
            about playhouses to a copy of the 1631 continuation of Stow's <title>Annales</title>,
            likely sometime between 1710 and 1844 according to Herbert Berry:</p>

              Garden. A playhouse for Stage Playes. On Mondayes Wedensdayes Fridayes and Saterdayes.

              take up and downe when they pleased. It was built In the yeare 1610.<note type="foot"
                >The notes run to 1673, ostensibly in period but are suspected as a forgery.
                Handwritten on paper, they are now bound separately from the <title>Annales</title>
                at the Folger Shakespeare Library where they are catalogued as follows: V.b. 275:

          <p>The building date is clearly an error or misremembering but it is possible that two
            days a week became the norm once again for bearbaiting after the players left the Hope.
            It seems evident that Jacob Meade continued to act as deputy for running the animal
            baiting from that date until his death in July 1624 while Alleyn assumed the solo
            mastership of the Bears, Bulls, and Mastiff Dogs from 1616 until his death.<note

              Unfortunately the Commissioners' Report for 1630 (LMA: SKCS/030) is unfit for

            have begun his activities there soon after Nurse died in 1631.<note type="foot">Godfrey
              must have left Bankside at some point during the Interregnum. He was buried on 19
              October 1662 in the parish of St James Clerkenwell where a note in the parish register
              identifies him as one 'who formerly kept the Beare garden ouer the bankside'; see LMA:
              P76/JS1/005, nf.</note></p>

          <p>Following the failed multi-purpose experiment at the Hope, activities there returned to
            the older, long-established pattern described with characteristic colour by the waterman
            John Taylor in <title>Bull, Beare, and Horse, Cut, Curtaile, and Longtaile</title>,
            published in 1638 and dedicated to Thomas Godfrey:</p>

          <quote type="block"><p>There's three couragious Bulls, as ever plaid, Twenty good Beares,
              as er'e to stake was taid. And seventy Mastives of such Breed and Races, That from
              fierce Lions will not turne their faces; A male and female Ape (kind Jacke and Jugge)
              Who with sweet complement do kisse and hugge, And lastly there is Jacke an Apes his
                Horse.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#bghop-ridm95877704"/>.</note></p></quote>

          <p>The custom continued of naming the star attractions to the Bear Garden (documented
            decades earlier). Taylor includes a roll call of bears, nineteen in all, with names such
            as 'Ned of Canterbury,' 'Robin Hood,' and 'Rose of Bedlam.' Notable are 'Mad Besse' and
            'Will Tookey,' two white bears, indicating that James I's predilection for baiting of
            polar bears in the Thames may have persisted into the 1630s.<note type="foot">On the
              acquisition and particular appeal of white bears in the period, see further Barbara
              Ravelhofer, 'Beasts of Recreation: Henslowe's White Bears,' <title>English Literary
                Renaissance</title> 32 (2002), 287–323.</note> Royalty did not frequent the popular
            arena on Bankside, as the game was brought to court instead. Notice of a blended
            audience of nobility and commoners, however, does occur more than once in the period, as
            for example in the description of Bankside amphitheatres in Nicholas Goodman's 1632
            pamphlet, <title>Hollands Leagver</title>: 'the other was a building of excellent Hope,
            and though wild beasts and Gladiators, did most possesse it, yet the Gallants that came
            to behold those combats, though they were of a mixt Society, yet were many Noble
            worthies amongst them.'<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#bghop-ridm96751128"
            /></note></p>

          <p>Other sources provide evidence of varied entertainments in the 1620s and '30s at the
            Hope, which once again became known familiarly as the Bear Garden. Edmund Howes, in his
            1632 continuation of Stow's <title>Annales</title>, mentions fencing contests in a
            retrospective on the opening of the Hope: 'besides the new built Beare garden, which was
            built as well for playes, and Fencers prizes, as Bull Bayting.'<note type="foot">See
                <ptr target="#bghop-ridp258075656"/></note> Further corroboration comes from
            transcriptions made from the lost office books kept by the master of the Revels, Henry
            Herbert: in 1632, for example, a fencing prize and a showing of a camel were both
            recorded on separate occasions.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#bghop-ridp265403288"
              />.</note></p>

          <p>Apart from closures during time of plague in 1630 and 1636, there are no official early
            seventeenth century records of suppression of the traditional entertainments at the Bear
            Garden before the 1640s.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#bghop-ridp266013160"/> and
                <ptr target="#bghop-ridp267855480"/>.</note> An order from the privy council stopped
            performances at the playhouses during time of a serious plague in 1625, but bearbaiting
            is not specifically mentioned and may have continued despite concerns about crowded
              gatherings.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#bghop-ridp265724792"/>.</note> However,
            more than plague would create problems for Godfrey's operation at the Bear Garden in the
            1640s. In December 1642 he ran into trouble with the authorities for participating in a
            protest riot at the Guildhall in London and was imprisoned at Newgate. Consequently, an
            order was passed in parliament 'that for the future, <add place="above">they doe not
                p<hi rend="italic">er</hi>mitt to bee vsed</add> ... the Game of Bearebateinge in
            these tymes of great distracc<hi rend="italic">i</hi>on<hi rend="italic">es</hi>. till
            this House doe giue further order herein.'<note type="foot">See <ptr
                target="#bghop-ridp265699256"/>.</note></p>

          <p>A Chancery Court case was launched a decade later in 1652 by Thomas Godfrey against
            Thomas Davies and Thomas Manley, whom he names as joint masters of the Bears, Bulls, and
            Mastiff Dogs with letters patent confirmed in 1638/9. Godfrey had been faithfully paying
            &#163;40 per annum for the right to act as deputy and &#163;60 annually for renting the
            tenement there. Among the grievances he lists as their deputy and tenant, he cites
            Thomas Davies' aggressive effort to shut down his bearbaiting entertainment operation in
            1642 and a subsequent killing of forty of his bears by 'diuers vnruly fellowes' at a
            personal cost of &#163;500. As a result of this calamity and prohibition by parliament
            in 1643, he claimed that he was unable to continue the game for two and a half years. He
            was, however, able to reopen the Bear Garden periodically following another order of
            parliament in April 1644.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#bghop-ridp248472488"/>, and
              also <ref target="https://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/collections/bghop/appendix-1/"
                >Appendix 1</ref>. See Hotson, 'Bear Gardens,' for details of parliamentary orders
              and ongoing bearbaiting activities during the Interregnum.</note></p>

          <p>Although the Bear Garden entertainments continued during the Interregnum at a reduced
            level longer than the London area public playhouses were allowed, Godfrey would soon
            experience even greater distress than he apparently felt in 1652. By May 1653 a
            parliamentary order was passed to suppress 'bear baiting, bull baiting, and playing for
            prizes by fencers hitherto practised in Southwark and other places, which have caused
            great evils and abominations.'<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#bghop-ridp268658248"
              />.</note></p>

          <p>Demolition of the Bear Garden and the demise or dispersal of its animals would follow
            in February 1655/6. The putative surviving witness to this event, however -- a
            manuscript note in a copy of Howe's 1631 continuation of Stowe's <title>Annales</title>
            has been dismissed by Herbert Berry as a likely forgery: 'And now pulled downe to make
            tennements, by Thomas Walker a Peticoate Maker in Cannon Streete on Tuesday the 25 day
            of March 1656. Seuen of Mr Godfries Beares by the command of Thomas Pride then hie
            Sh[e]riefe of Surry were then Shot to death, On Saterday the 9 day of February 1655[/6].
            by a Company of Souldiers.'<note type="foot">Folger Shakespeare Library: V.b. 275, p 16,
              as quoted by Berry, 'Folger MS V.b.275,' p 286.</note> Berry contends that the section
            on the demise and demolition of the Hope in 1656 'could well be right in detail' but the
            various period sources used are not cited and the main writer was not
              contemporaneous.<note type="foot">See above and also Berry, 'Folger MS V.b.275,' pp
              262–93.</note></p>

          <p>A Worcestershire magistrate named Henry Townshend noted the final days in his diary as
            follows: 'Feb. Col. Pride, now Sir Thomas Pride, by reason of some difference between
            him and the Keeper Godfrey of the Bears in the Bear Garden in Southwark, as a justice of
            the peace there caused all the Bears to be fast tied up by the noses and then valiantly
            brought some files of musketeers, drew up and gave fire and killed six or more bears in
            the place (only leaving one white innocent cub), and also all courts of the game. It is
            said all the mastifs are for to be shipt for Jamaica.'<note type="foot">As quoted in the
                <title>Diary of Henry Townshend of Elmley Lovett. 1640–1663</title>, J.W. Willis

              <ab>Furthermore, outside the city there are a number of theatres, in which English
                actors perform, almost every day, tragedies and comedies amidst a great crowd of
                people. These are generally concluded with various dances with very agreeable music
                employed, and with the great applause of the people<gap reason="omitted"/> There is
                still another place, also having the form of a theatre, which is intended for the
                baiting (<hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> hunting) of bulls and bears, who, fastened from
                behind, are exceedingly harassed by large dogs and English mastiffs - which in the
                vernacular are called 'Docken' - but so that often those dogs, being seized by the
                teeth or attacked by the horns, by the bears or bulls, are often in mortal danger,
                and even sometimes die. Fresh and keener ones are immediately supplied in the places
                of those that are wounded, or tired.</ab>

              <ab>The whipping of a fully blinded bear sometimes occurs at the end of this
                entertainment, where five or six standing in a circle, fall upon the bear pitiably
                with whips. And, although being tethered he is unable to flee, nevertheless he
                defends himself with spirit. He throws down those standing around who get too close
                unless they rightly and providently watch out for themselves, and he tears the whips
                out of the hands of those who strike (him), and breaks them. At these
                entertainments, and everywhere else they happen to be <pb n="133" type="page"/> the
                English constantly use, in following manner, the plant nicotiana, which in the
                American idiom they call 'tobacco'; others say 'paetum.' They put the said herb,
                which has been dried so that it can easily be made into powder, into a hole at the
                back end of a pipe made for this purpose from clay, and light it by applying a
                flame. Smoke is drawn into the mouth by the front end, and it goes back out through
                the nostrils, as if through a funnel. It brings out with it a great deal of phlegm
                and discharge of the head. In these theatres, moreover, various fruits, such as
                apples, pears and nuts, according to the season, are carried about to be sold, as
                well as wine and ale.</ab>

              12/267, f 71. The subsequent patent for Dorrington's grant of the desirable office of
              the <rs ref="eats:160515" type="Collective_Office">royal game of Bears, Bulls, and
                Mastiff Dogs</rs>, was made on 11 August 1598; see TNA: C66/1485. It is worth noting
              here that two draft letters patent in the name of Elizabeth I (never executed) survive
              in separate archives for Henslowe and Alleyn, presumably drawn up by them in
              anticipation of gaining the office of master of the Bears, Bulls, and Mastiff Dogs in
              1598. The draft letter patent for Henslowe, dated June 1598, survives at Dulwich
              College; see Ioppolo, <title>Henslowe-Alleyn Digitisation Project</title>, <ref
                target="https://henslowe-alleyn.org.uk/catalogue/muniments-series-1/group-018/01-recto/"
                >MUN 18</ref>. A transcription was published by Collier, <title>Memoirs</title>, pp
              213-15. Alleyn's draft letter patent, dated 1598, can be found at TNA: WARD
              2/61/241/43. </p>

            <p>Greg suggests that My Lady Edmonds was 'probably the wife of Sir Thomas Edmonds,
              Comptroller of the Household, and the Dorothy Edmonds mentioned as a gentlewoman of
              the privy chamber in 1580'; see <title>Henslowe Papers</title>, p 98, n 9; BL: MS
              Lansdowne 29, f 161. Edward Darcy was a groom of the privy chamber from 1583–1603; see
                <ref

            <p> Sir John Dorrington, gentleman pensioner, was knighted at Whitehall on 23 July 1603.
              The grant to him of the office, with a fee of l0d a day and 4d for his deputy, was
              made on 7 August 1598; see <title>Calendar of State Papers Domestic: Elizabeth,
                1598-1601</title>, Mary Anne Everett Green (ed) (London, 1869), 79. His patent was
              dated 11 August, and was renewed by James I on 14 July 1603; see Ioppolo,
                <title>Henslowe-Alleyn Digitisation Project</title>, <ref target="https://henslowe-

                Mun 25</ref>. Arthur Langworth was a friend of Henslowe and Alleyn, frequently
              mentioned in the diary. He was evidently in town at this moment while his wife was
              entertaining the Alleyns in the country. Alleyn was still, or again, there when
              Henslowe sent his subsequent letter of 26 September; see Ioppolo,

                I, f [2v]</ref>. Langworth 'married Rose, daughter of Will Durant of Cottesmore, co.
              Rutland, and died in 1606, the probate of his will being dated 6 Nov'; see Warner,

            <p>Collier provided readings of some of the damaged sections but Greg, writing just over
              sixty years later, questioned Collier's additions: 'It is clear, I think, that
              although Collier printed certain words which cannot now be made out, he could not
              really read more than is now legible. Several of his readings can be shown to be
              impossible, while some of his blanks can be easily filled up' (<title>Henslowe's
                Papers</title>, p 25). For this reason, only Greg’s readings, with his conjectures
              enclosed in angled brackets, are provided in our textual notes.</p>

                type="Place_F_Playhouse">Whitefriars</rs> by January 1609/10. As this document
              indicates, Rosseter's boys' company amalgamated with Lady Elizabeth's Men in March
              1612/13, although whether the newly merged troupe performed at any playhouse other
              than Whitefriars at this time is only subject for speculation. For more detail on both
              companies, see Gurr, <title>Shakespearian Playing Companies</title>, pp 357-61, and

                before it grew ranke, or festered too farre in the Worlds Apprehension. But to the
                purpose: <rs ref="eats:221802" type="Person_Male">Maister Taylor</rs>, the

                Proiect; which was as followeth: That hee the said Taylor had studied such seuerall
                Humors in Prose, as neuer were the like before: (which indeede fell out true, to his
                shame) wherein hee would haue me ioyne; hee to <rs ref="eats:204281"
                  type="Entertainment_Type">play a Scene in Prose, and I to answere him in
                  Verse</rs>: Whereto I condiscended, on these Conditions; viz. That I might haue
                halfe the Commoditie thereof; Or Securitie for fiue pounds; Or else twentie
                shillings in hand, and the rest as the Day affoorded. Next, That I might heare his
                  <rs ref="eats:70656" type="Thing_BookPlayMusic">Booke</rs> read (which was fit) to
                know on what ground I might build my Inuention. And last, That I should see the
                Manner of his Challenge before it was published, and set my Answere to it with my
                owne hand. To all which hee graunted, and deliuered mee fiue Shillings vpon the
                same: Whereupon I promised faithfully, That if all this were on his part performed,
                I would (God willing) meete him, and with my best endeauor striue to giue the
                Audience content. Now, here I must entreat you, before you condemne mee, note but
                the Occasions of my Breach of Promise: This Water-Taylor, with his Confederates,
                presuming he had bound <pb n="A4" type="signature"/> me with his Earnest-money,
                printed his Challenge-Bill, and my Answere annexed thereunto, without my Hand,
                Knowledge, or Consent: Nay more; My Answere was by him set vp so meane and
                insufficient to so brauing a Challenge, that I altogether disliked thereof (as I had
                reason) and thereupon sent my Man with the Money fiue dayes before the Play, to
                certifie them, That I was otherwise employed, and would not come, in regard of the
                Wrong done vnto mee, in setting vp my Answere without my Consent: My <rs
                  ref="eats:297010" type="Collective_Occupations">Man</rs> deliuered the Message,
                but lost the Money at Play, emboldening himselfe vpon the Wrongs I had receiued;
                which I haue since payed. And the same day I receiued a Letter out of <rs
                  ref="eats:2327" type="Place_County">Warwickeshire</rs> from my Father, That he was
                not well; wishing mee and my wife to repayre vnto him with all possible speede. Now,
                you that are Parents of Children, or Children to Parents, Iudge, whether I ought
                rather to disobay my Father, or displease Iohn Taylor; purchase my Fathers hate, or
                lose a Scullers loue; and I hope you will say I had sufficient cause to keepe me
                from the Hope. But fearing my homely Truth (though it be sufficient to plead my
                Honestie) is not answerable to your <pb n="A4 verso" type="signature"/> expectation
                of my Practise in Poesie; I will, as neere as I can, fit my Muse to your liking,

                pretended ffor his Ma<ex>ies</ex>ties Atturney saith that the note soe made was and
                is agreeing with the last ‸<add place="above">will</add> and testament of the said

            <ab> In the dispute between the Attorney General and William Henslowe and Jacob Meade,
              related by Alleyn, Letters Patent of 25 June 1618 had ordered a Commission to survey
              the boundaries of the Bear Gardens and call witnesses. Bromfield and Tichborne, both
              associates of Alleyn, were two of the commissoners appointed. See <ref

              <ab>James, by the grace of God, king of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland,
                defender of the faith, etc, (sends) greetings to our beloved Robert Bromfield
                esquire, John Hunt esquire, Lionel Tichborne gentleman, and William Day gentleman.
                Since disputes and disagreements lately arisen have been held and raised in our
                court before the treasurer, chancellor, and barons of our exchequer at Westminster
                between our attorney general, plaintiff on our behalf, and William Henslowe and
                Jacob Meade, defendents, regarding one principal messuage and tenement, or inn,
                lately called the Unicorn, with appurtenances, and all those messuages, cottages,
                curtilages, wharfs, gardens, orchards, and, by our inheritances, with the
                appurtenances formerly in the tenure or possession of John Allen, Robert Mote,
                Robert Johnson, Leonard Willis, John Dancy, Thomas Warren, Thomas Floody, Robert
                Exninge, Peter Hemminge, or of any one or any of their assigns, or any one of them,
                situated, lying, or existing in the parish of St Saviour's in the borough of
                Southwark in our county of Surrey lately of the lands and tenements of Henry
                Polsted, esquire, and exchanged by that very Henry Polsted with Edward VI, formerly
                king of England, in or around the sixth year of his reign, and afterwards by the
                same late Edward VI, king of England by his letters patent regarding the demise
                bearing the date 26 April in said sixth year of his reign granted to the aforesaid
                Henry Polsted for a term of twenty-one years with an annual rent of £32 4s 5d and
                afterwards by the late lady queen, Elizabeth, by her letters patent sealed with her
                great seal of England at Westminster bearing the date of 11 October in the
                thirty-seventh year of her reign granted to a certain Robert Livesey esquire and a
                certain Gerard Gore – with the exception of a tenement and parcel of land now or
                lately called 'the Queen's pike garden,' a parcel thereafter reserved to the same
                late queen - for a term of fifty years, at that time to come, for an annual rent of
                £27 14s 10d. With these things having been granted and because it is not yet
                apparent to our said court where and in which place or in which places our aforesaid
                lands and tenements lie and exist, you should know for that reason that we, trusting
                greatly in your faith, industry, and provident circumspection in the conduct of our
                business, assign you and give to you, to four, three, and two of you full power and
                authority, and we entrust you, four or three or two of you, by the presents, both by
                your viewing and perambulation of either three of you or two of you and by the
                examinations and depositions of any trustworthy witnesses and by all other ways,
                means, and measures by which you might better know or be able, or three or two of
                you might know or be able, to inquire where and in what place or in what places the
                aforesaid land and our tenements lie and exist and (where) the same (are) separable
                by limits and boundaries from other lands both of the aforesaid defendants and from
                any others lying contiguous to the same which are to be divided and bounded so that
                perfect knowledge of the same and of each of the same parcels may be known
                thereafter, and also diligently to examine any witnesses regarding and concerning
                any of the articles or interrogatories to be exhibited or weighed touching the
                premises both on our behalf and on the part of the aforesaid defendants. And
                therefore we command you that, on a day and at a place of this kind, or on days and
                at places, which you will have arranged or three or two of you will have arranged
                for this purpose, you attend to the premisses or three or two of you attend, and
                that you do and execute, or that three or two of you do and execute, all and each of
                those things with the effect in the aforesaid form so that you have, or two or more
                of you have, both the examinations and depositions of the aforesaid witnesses as
                well as all the rest done by you or by two or more of you to be delivered before the
                barons of our Exchequer at Westminster as quickly as you are able, and at the latest
                within fifteen days after the day of St Michael under you seals, or (the seals) of
                three or of two of you, together with this our commission. We also give to you, or
                to three or two of you, full power and authority by the presents to call before you,
                or three or two of you, any persons whom you see to be especially suitable for
                attestation of the truth in the premises and diligently to examine (them) on their
                oaths which are to be taken, the holy gospels of God having first been touched
                corporally by them before you, or two or more of you, on and regarding the premises.
                Lest this our earlier command should remain further to be executed, we grant,
                moreover, to all and singular our mayors, sheriffs, bailiffs, constables, and other
                officers, ministers and underlings, whomever they may be, by the tenor of the
                presents firmly in command that to you and to each one of you in the execution of
                the premises should obey, comply with, and heed just as is proper at the peril of
                the incumbent, with the proviso always that the aforesaid defendants should have
                forewarning of a length of forty days regarding the day and place of the execution
                of the presents. In witness of which matter, we have made these our letters to be
                patent with Lawrence Tanfield, knight, as witness at Westminster on 25 June in the
                twenty-sixth year of our reign of England, France, and Ireland, the fifty-first of
                Scotland by the memorandum roll concerning the same year (of the reign) of this
                king, of the commissions of the city, and by the roll of letters patent. And by
                order of the court, etc. And by the barons.</ab>

          <p>Life as deputy keeper and tenant of the Bear Garden was not easy for Thomas Godfrey, as
            his Chancery Court pleading in 1652 reveals. In 1642 <rs ref="eats:360580"
              type="Person_StatusOther">Thomas Davies</rs>, one of the masters of the Bears, Bulls,
            and Mastiff Dogs, attempted to suppress Godfrey's bearbaiting enterprise and withdraw
            the lease of the Bear Garden. The subsequent order of the council of state, on 5 May

          <p>The numerous literary allusions as well as foreign and domestic eyewitness descriptions
            of activities at <rs ref="eats:227798" type="Place_F_Arena">the Bear Garden</rs> from
            the mid-sixteenth century onwards are beyond the scope of this collection. E.K. Chambers
            included a generous sampling of eyewitness accounts in his chapter on the Hope playhouse
            -- see <title>Elizabethan Stage</title>, vol 2, especially pp 454–7 -- but a systematic
            search of continental as will as British archives would be needed to expand our
            knowledge of the Bear Garden's history from the vantage point of individual audience
            members. Only a few representative instances are included in this appendix therefore,
            with some further notices quoted in the <ref
              target="https://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/collections/bghop/entertainment/"
              >Introduction: History of Entertainment</ref>.</p>
          <lb/>
          <p>Similarly, literary allusions are numerous, so only a few early and later quotations
            from period print sources are provided. Fuller discussion of plays featuring bears in
            the Shakespearean era can be found, for example, in Andreas H&#246;fele's study,
              <title>Stage, Stake, and Scaffold: Humans and Animals in Shakespeare's Theatre</title>
            (Oxford, 2011) and in Barbara Ravelhofer's '"Beasts of Recreacion": Henslowe's White
            Bears,' <title>English Literary Renaissance</title> 32. 2 (2002), 287–323.</p>

                    hundred dogs shut up, each one separated from the other in certain small
                    compartments made of boards, and they (ie, the dogs) are those which we use in
                    Venice in bull-baitings. They also have in another house many bears, and in
                    another some wild bulls, and in the middle is a circular space surrounded by
                    stands with their awnings/covers for the rain and for the sun, where every
                    Sunday in the training of these dogs one takes great entertainment/pastime,
                    paying a penny to stand below (which is s.2) and two to go up into the stands.
                    The sport runs from the vesper hour until the evening; and there they put on
                    very fine baitings. First they lead into this space, which is closed about, and
                    one cannot leave it if they do not open certain gates, they bring in, I say, a
                    horse of little value with all its trappings, and a monkey in the saddle, then
                    four, or six of the younger dogs, with which they make an attack, and (then)
                    they change them, bringing in other more experienced ones, in which baiting it
                    is splendid to see the horse flee, kicking its hooves, and biting, and to see
                    the monkey hold on tightly to the saddle, and scream, many times being bitten,
                    in which baiting, after they have entertained the bystanders for a while, often
                    with the death of the horse, it is removed (from the arena, and) there they
                    bring in some bears, now one at a time, and then several together, but this
                    baiting is not very fine to watch. Finally they then bring in a wild bull, and
                    they tie it with a rope about two paces long to a stake fixed in the middle, and
                    this baiting is finer to watch than the others, and with more danger for the
                    dogs than the others, many of which are wounded and die, and it lasts until

                <p> Dawson explains Magno's valuation of the English penny in Italian terms as
                  follows: 'Magno here (as elsewhere in the MS) uses a symbol impossible to
                  reproduce which appears to stand for <hi rend="italic">soldi di piccoli</hi>. The
                    <hi rend="italic">denaro</hi>, which was not a specific Italian coin, he equates
                  here with the penny (as Florio also does in <title>Queen Anna's cw World of
                    Words</title>, 1611) and explains it, apparently, as equivalent to two
                    <title>soldi di piccoli</title>. The penny in the 1560's contained .48 grams of
                  pure silver, and two <title>soldi di piccoli</title> were equivalent to about .5
                  grams' ('Bull-Baiting,' p 98, n 1). </p>

                    put in first to part them: It's pitty such beastly Fellowes should bee so well
                    maintain'd, they torment poore creatures, &amp; make a gaines and game of it.

          <p>The principal purpose of Appendix 4 is to summarize and guide the user chronologically,
            case by case, through the prolonged and complex litigation that took place in the courts
            of Chancery and the Exchequer concerning the ownership and situation of the Bear Gardens

            Philip Henslowe and that of Edward Alleyn. Another purpose of Appendix 4 is to simplify
            the referencing in the chapter on the 'History of the Properties,' and in the headnotes

          <p>We are very fortunate in the survival of some, if not all, bills, answers, replications
            and rejoinders raised by the principals in the suits brought to these courts and also in
            the survival of supporting court records. Briley, 'Edward Alleyn and Henslowe's Will,'
            pp 321–30, referred to and used many of the relevant orders and decrees of Chancery (C
            33) but we have added to his corpus. Cerasano, 'Master of the Bears,' pp 205-6, pointed
            the way to some of the records of the court of Exchequer (E 124), and these too we have
            explored further<note type="foot">We are very grateful to Daniel Gosling, Legal Records

              court by Chancery and would be distributed to the bishop and Alleyn for their perusal.
              In the meantime publication of the depositions should be delayed.</p>
