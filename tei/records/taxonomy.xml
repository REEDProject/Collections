                <p>Records of Early English Drama (REED) is an international scholarly project that
                    is establishing for the first time the context from which the drama of
                    Shakespeare and his contemporaries grew. Founded in 1976, REED has worked since
                    then to locate, transcribe, and edit historical documents containing evidence of
                    drama, secular music, and other communal entertainment and ceremony from the
                    Middle Ages until 1642, when the Puritans closed the London theatres.</p>

                            beginning in 1519, which are in the same hand as entries for the years
                            1611 onwards, so they presumably were copied by the town clerk or his
                            scribe; (b) accounts of bailiffs, chamberlains, churchwardens, and
                            schoolwardens, because the accounts of the minor officials were
                            presented and approved by the corporation officials before being entered
                            into the town book. In the transcriptions, the entries from the
                            churchwardens are differentiated from the bailiffs' (later the mayors')
                            accounts because they originated from different authorities. The
                            churchwardens' accounting year was 21 December–20 December, with the
                            accounts presented to the bailiffs between 13 February and 19 March, the
                            Friday following Quadragesima Sunday. The bailiffs' accounting year was
                            18 October–17 October, with the accounts similarly being presented
                            between 13 February and 19 March. The mayoral accounting year was later
                            adjusted slightly to begin the next Monday after St Luke's Day (ie, 27

                            including orders for payments, letters, and many other types of official
                            records concerning the running of the vast duchy of Lancaster. Some of
                            the orders are addressed to borough and other local officials within the
                            duchy, and deal with local arrangements. Two such excerpts deal with
                            Newcastle under Lyme and Tutbury, and hence the register books are fully
                            described above, under those boroughs. The register books also contain a
                            vast amount of material about the running of Gaunt's various households
                            in England, as far-flung as Bamburgh, Leicester, Kenilworth, Kingston
                            Lacy, Hertford, and the Savoy, as well as others in Europe. Records of
                            his payments for minstrels and other entertainers have been transcribed,
                            wherever activities or payments for them may have occurred, because the
                            administrative centres of the duchy appear to have been Tutbury and

                            [a/b] and [c/d], the two variant versions of the orders. It is assumed
                            that [a], the version of the orders which cannot be precisely dated, is
                            earlier because it is a re-issue (with minor changes, errors, and
                            omissions) of the orders of 1618 (TNA: DL 41/587). Presumably the letter
                            of 7 May 1630, [b], was intended to accompany this version of the
                            orders. It could not have been intended for the orders dated later, the
                            revised orders of 10 May 1630 (1631?), item [c]. These revised orders
                            presumably reflect changes ordered by the new chancellor of the duchy of
                            Lancaster, Edward Barrett, Lord Newburgh, who held office from April
                            1629 concurrently with his predecessor, Sir <rs

                                type="Person_Gentry">Humphrey May</rs>, or perhaps by May himself.
                            May's death in June 1630 likely caused some upheaval in the workings of
                            the Chancery office, and may account for the confusion in dates with
                            this version of the orders. In any case there appears to have been a
                            delay of a little over a year before the revised orders, item [c], were
                            issued, along with item [d], Newburgh's letter of 21 May 1631 ordering
                            that the orders be exemplified and enforced. However, the existence of
                            an exemplification dated 10 May 1630 (1631?) may indicate that
                            Newburgh's letter was related to yet another recension of the orders,
                            now lost. The relationships between these variant versions, one
                            concludes, are not at all clear.</ab>

                            in Staffordshire Record Office for consultation by arrangement. It
                            contains annual churchwardens' accounts, presented usually at Lady Day
                            or Mid-Lent Sunday each year; in most cases the date of presentation
                            specifies the calendar year. This is assumed to have been in Old Style
                            and the year has been corrected accordingly (for example, 1520 has been
                            given as 1520/1). There are several cases in which both the calendar and
                            regnal year are specified; in these the year appears to be given in New
                            Style and has not been corrected. The handwriting, presumably that of
                            the parish clerk, changes several times in the course of the years

                                William Macray for the Historical Manuscript Commission in 1888
                                ('Corporation of Reading,' pp 167–227). Fourteen rolls before 1413
                                seen by Macray are no longer extant. Those for 1363–4, 1366–7,
                                1367–8, 1378–9, and 1384–5 were used by Norman Gibbs in his Oxford
                                doctoral thesis in 1935. All had disappeared by 1960 (Slade,
                                    <title>Reading Gild Accounts</title>, pt 1, pp xvii–xxii). There
                                has been speculation that the disappearance was as a result of enemy
                                action during the Second World War when Reading, by then an
                                important railway centre, was heavily bombed. Macray does not record
                                the accounting year, but later MS evidence indicates that it was
                                Michaelmas to Michaelmas. </p></note>

                            until Good Friday 1521, the account for 1521–2 clearly states that it

                            living, which explains why the manuscript is in the college archives
                            (Williams, <title>Early Churchwardens Accounts</title>, p 76). The many
                            shelfmarks on the cover of the manuscript are due to the fact that it
                            was originally held in the college library, then was deposited in the
                            Bodleian Library in the 1890s, returned to Corpus Christi in 1984, and
                            then transferred from the college library to the college archives. Henry

                            lists the manuscript as Corpus Christi College MS CCCLXXVI. The
                            manuscript has been a good deal damaged and repaired. Some leaves
                            survive intact, some only damaged at edges, not affecting the written
                            text, but some are very extensively damaged so that only a half to a
                            third of the leaf remains. The receipts are often dominated by the sale
                            of one tod of wool. The accounts survive in a fairly orderly
                            chronological run from 1541 to 1607, though the accounts for 1553 to
                            1555 are missing. Then there is a gap until 1619 and from that point the
                            accounts are summary only to 1656. At the end of the manuscript is a
                            list of rates for the Holy Loaf in a late sixteenth-century hand. This
                            manuscript was formerly identified by the shelfmark 376.</ab>

                                pageantry at Elvetham was entered in the Stationer's Register on 1
                                October by the printer John Wolfe of London and issued as a quarto

                                in Progresse, at Eluetham in Hampshire, by the right Honorable the
                                Earle of Hertford.' No author is named on the title page, but the
                                description of the events appears to have been written by a member
                                of Hertford's household: he consistently refers to Hertford as 'my
                                Lord' in the first printed version of the text (Q1; see below) and
                                the substantive changes made in the later, corrected printing (Q2)
                                reflect first-hand knowledge of the event. Some of the songs are
                                known from other sources to have been written by Thomas Watson,
                                while the Phyllida and Coridon song is known to be by Nicholas
                                Breton. Earlier editors have offered a number of other names as
                                authors of part or all of the text, but their arguments are highly
                                speculative. <rs

                                differs substantially from the other three, so Davies has designated
                                it Q2. The differences suggest that most of Q1 was written before
                                the events it describes, and it represents Hertford's plans for the
                                queen's visit, although it does mention the rain on the second day
                                that delayed and altered some of the planned entertainments. Q2 has
                                been more heavily corrected to represent what actually happened, and
                                adds marginal notes to the description of the fourth day that tell
                                us that the queen displayed great patience in enduring more rain in
                                order to witness the pageantry for her departure. Q2 also adds
                                details in a number of places in the text, though it leaves out one
                                extended description of the third day's banquet that appears in Q1
                                (which can be found here in the endnote). Q2 also includes a more

                                Nichols had many inaccuracies, as he originally based his text on Q1
                                and then created a composite version after he encountered Q2, which
                                appears in the 1823 edition of Nichols' <title>Progresses</title>.
                                Q2 then disappeared from scholarly view for two centuries, until
                                Davies located it at <rs

                                scholars used Nichols' botched composite, or attempted to sort out

                                or more copies of Q1. Moreover, the illustration of the artificial
                                lake and other set-pieces included by Nichols and frequently

                                earlier editions of the Elvetham entertainment, see Davies, 'Queen's
                                Entertainment at Elvetham,' pp 562–95.) The edition included here
                                takes Q2 as its copy text throughout, both because it has been
                                corrected and because REED's emphasis is on what was performed,
                                rather than what was originally written. Variant readings in Q1 are
                                given in the textual notes; accidental variants of spelling,
                                punctuation, and typography have been ignored.<lb/></p></note>

                            fading. The terminal year is definitely 'x' followed by partly faded
                            letter that could be a 'v,' and then fairly clearly a 'j.' This would
                            make it 15–16 Richard II, and it has been identified as from that year

                            accounts is on the cover – a paper one probably of nineteenth-century
                            provenance, which gives the date '1579.' None of the entertainers
                            mentioned in this set of steward's accounts appear in the <rs

                                type="Collective_Office">mayor's</rs> accounts for 1578–9, while the
                            mayor's accounts for 1579–80 contain no rewards to itinerant
                            entertainers, suggesting that it was the steward who did the rewarding
                            in that year. The responsibility for recording rewards to visiting
                            performers seems to shift back and forth between the mayor and steward
                            in the late sixteenth century, as such payments are found in the
                            accounts of both but almost never in the same year. Where rewards to
                            entertainers do appear in both the mayor's and steward's accounts, as
                            they do in the 1534–5 accounts, the amounts paid to particular groups
                            match up across the two sets of accounts. These entries have thus been
                            dated to 1579–80 here, following Burch (<title>Minstrels and
                                Players</title>, p 44).</ab>

                            separated from accounts of other years: the first seven leaves are for

                            of handwriting, names of town officials mentioned in the accounts, and

                            instituted extensive reforms in town government, including its
                            accounting practices. For that reason, the borough accounts kept by the
                            stewards were also copied into the Second Book of Remembrance. The
                            accounting year ran from Michaelmas to Michaelmas. Most of the amounts
                            recorded were annual and customary ones paid as wages to the officers of
                            the town, for example, the town clerk, sergeants, and cranemen. The

                            cross-referencing easy. Many items are entered in great detail – such as

                            apprenticeships privately arranged by indenture. The poor apprentices

                            town took responsibility, and apprenticing them was seen as a
                            preventative against vagrancy. For further details about the

                            As the roll covers the period from Michaelmas to Michaelmas, the date of
                            this roll must be 1513–1514.'</ab>

                            Winchester, 1888), 170). According to the college archivist, a note next
                            to the 1623 Longland entry says 'gladio interrumpt' et in claust'
                            sepult',' but there is no date given for his death.</ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc">The authorship of this poem is unclear. All the
                            handwriting in the manuscript, with the exception of the last page,
                            appears to be the same, and the manuscript includes at least one poem
                            attributed to Donne. Others are by Carew, Cleveland, and Beaumont and
                            Fletcher. There are several others signed 'H' and 'HH,' which could be
                            by the writer himself, who appears to have some connection with <rs

                            College or Christ Church but not with New College, as might be expected
                            if there had been any personal connection with Winchester College. The
                            manuscript is undated but Hudson gives the dates as between 1615 and
                            1640, although the last entry appears to be dated 1637 ('Schoolboy
                            Tragedy,' pp 153–4). The poems are copied down at random, not in any
                            date order of the events to which they refer. 'On Dr Dun's Death,' for
                            example, comes earlier in the manuscript than the poem attributed to
                            Donne himself. The poem was written by someone who considered himself a
                            friend and who knew what part Longland took in the performance, so he
                            could well have been a Winchester scholar. Longland did not live long
                            enough to matriculate at Oxford, although his friend may well have done
                            so and have been at New College. Hudson also says that a number of the
                            pieces in the manuscript deal with Winchester College as well as with
                            Oxford, but there is no mention of Winchester at all in the text of this
                            commonplace book.<lb/></ab>

                            later in the bursars' accounts, 'Commons' section. The visitors eating
                            in hall were entered at the end of each week, generally across both
                            columns, under the heading of 'Jurnelli,' that is, guests. The listings
                            start on the left with the day of the week followed by a list of guests,
                            usually without commas or virgules, and then a formulaic entry such as
                            'ad prandium/cenam cum socijs' or 'cum famulis.' Sometimes the visitors
                            were listed as eating at the top table with the warden, sometimes with
                            the junior fellows ('socijs'), and sometimes with the servants
                            ('famulis'). This pecking order gives us some idea of the status

                            sometimes the year the book was started and sometimes when it ended.
                            Sometimes there are two entries in different hands; the lengthier one in
                            Latin appears to be contemporary and the other brief one is in a later
                            hand. Each week starts with a Saturday and is not dated but designated
                            by a heading such as '2nd week, 2nd quarter' and then by the days in
                            Latin. These have been given specific dates with reference to H. Chitty,
                            bursar from the 1910s to 30s, who went to considerable lengths to verify
                            the dates and also to establish dates where no cover has survived,
                            through reference to the corresponding account rolls where they exist or
                            else to lists of scholars/fellows and their dates of admission. The

                            dated 5 September 1591, there are two references to orders agreed 'in
                            the booke of reme<ex>m</ex>braunce.' Since most payments from the city
                            coffers were authorized by orders recorded in the Proceedings Books and
                            no Books of Remembrance are listed in the HRO catalogue, it has been
                            necessary to undertake a lengthy investigation to discover what and
                            where these Books of Remembrance might be. Alderman Jacob on p 4 of Top
                            Win 3/2 (one of his scrapbooks of press cuttings) refers to 'Old records
                                <gap reason="omitted"/> Coffer, sessional and Remembrance.' Further,
                            in an article on Elizabethan trade, 'A Glimpse at Trade in Winton in
                            Queen Elizabeth's Reign,' <title>Hampshire Notes and Queries</title> 4
                            (1889), 40–1, he quotes from 'a curious book: "The remembrance of
                            thinges agreed in the <rs
                                ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/111704/"
                                type="Place_F_GuildHall">Council House</rs>"' (p 40). From the
                            records he quotes it has been possible to trace this book to what the
                            HRO catalogue calls 'Proceedings Book A' (W/B2/2), which was rebound in
                            the early part of the twentieth century and has the title on its cover,
                            'Proceedings of the Corporation.' From this evidence it was established
                            that the orders 'in the booke of reme<ex>m</ex>braunce' referred to in
                            the Coffer Account Book and quoted above are at f 10v and f 11 of the
                            HRO's Proceedings Book A and that therefore the Proceedings Books were
                            originally known as Books of Remembrance. It appears that the original
                            title must have been lost at the time of rebinding. The city archivist
                            has now amended the HRO catalogue description to reflect these findings,
                            although the books will not be renamed because of the number of
                            references to them in printed sources.</ab>

                                <title>Elizabethan Winchester</title> (London, 1963), 91). The fact
                            that Thorpe was re-elected mayor in 1623 suggests that his fellows on
                            the council did not think him the demon that <rs

                                type="Person_Commoner">Coleman</rs> did. Coleman's complaint accuses
                            Thorpe of a number of abuses while mayor, among them refusing Coleman
                            entry into the twenty-four for no reason and showing a malicious hatred
                            of Coleman. The charge given the most space is that several men were
                            brought before Thorpe as justice of the town court, accused of running
                            tippling houses without licences, and that Thorpe not only <rs

                                to continue</rs>. Coleman adds that these men were suspected of
                            keeping unruly houses and being receivers of stolen goods. The crucial
                            point, though, is that all the accused brewed their <rs
                                ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40997/"

                            Thorpe, whereas none of the previously licensed <rs

                            Thorpe's two mills. Coleman argues that the result has been considerable
                            economic loss to other mill owners. Coleman also accuses Thorpe of
                            failing to collect fines from other offenders, fines that should have
                            gone to Coleman and others, letting the offenders go unpunished, as in

                            Williams believed the original accounts to have been lost and so used an
                            eighteenth-century transcript, but the manuscript was found and is now
                            held by the HRO (<title>Early Churchwardens' Accounts</title>, p 164).
                            The accounts run from 1548 to 1596, after which there is a gap until a
                            single year's account dated 19 January 1605/6. The accounting period
                            varies, sometimes covering two or three years, and usually beginning in
                            early January, though the date ranges from 29 December to as late as 24

                            issued in 1554. Its minutes begin in 1570 and it was the earliest of the
                            London Commissions to be established on an organised basis. The area of
                            its jurisdiction ran from East Molesey in Surrey to the River
                            Ravensbourne, and included Lambeth, Southwark, Bermondsey, Newington,
                            Deptford, Rotherhithe, Clapham, Battersea, Camberwell, Vauxhall,
                            Wandsworth, Putney, Barnes, Kew, Lewisham, Walworth, Kennington, Nine
                            Elms, Peckham and New Cross. The area of jurisdiction remained the same
                            throughout the three centuries during which it functioned.' See further

                            (A)</title>
                        <note type="edDesc"><p>The original inventories were first discovered in 'a
                                bundle of loose papers,' presumably at Dulwich College, by Edmond
                                Malone, who published his transcription in 1790 ('Rise and
                                Progress,' pp 289, 300–7), subsequently reprinted from Malone by
                                various successors including Foakes, <title>Henslowe's
                                Diary</title>, Appendix 2. The manuscript original has not yet
                                surfaced so Malone's transcript has been used as the source here
                                also. Others who have quoted Malone, notably Greg, <title>Henslowe
                                    Papers</title>, pp 113–23, have provided conjectural notes and
                                identifications for props and titles included in the inventories;
                                these are noted below only where some certainty exists. Malone
                                glossed some words in square brackets embedded in the text; these
                                are not included in this transcription.<lb/><lb/> A second inventory
                                of theatrical apparel survives in the original, tentatively dated
                                    <hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1601/2 and therefore related to the <rs

                                Greg, <title>Henslowe Papers</title>, pp 52–5. The date given in the
                                transcription here places the inventories into the period when the
                                Admiral's Men were either resident at the Rose on Bankside or on the
                                road in the provinces. They did not relocate to the new Fortune
                                playhouse north of the Thames until 1600.<lb/><lb/> While comparing
                                the details in the inventories with the loan accounts and the diary
                                itself, Neil Carson has suggested that the inventories were only a
                                partial list of the company's resources (<title>Companion</title>,
                                pp 49–53). Although ownership is not expressed and the handwriting
                                of the compiler cannot be examined, Carson deduces that by 'whomever
                                compiled, however, the inventory is most probably (like the
                                companion inventories of properties and costumes) a list belonging
                                to the players' of the Admiral's company (<title>Companion</title>,
                                p 49).<lb/><lb/> For abstracts of the document and details of its

                                among the Yorkshire gentry. He organised a number of petitions and
                                protests, and in 1639 he refused to pay ship money. As a result, he
                                was dismissed from his posts and was called before the Council of
                                State; the king reportedly told him that if he interfered again he
                                would hang him. In April 1640 Cholmley was again elected MP for
                                Scarborough in the Short Parliament. He was re-elected for
                                Scarborough for the Long Parliament in November 1640 and was created
                                a baronet in 1641, but was prevented from sitting in 1643. His

                            west end of the cathedral. The prior's house – now the 'Eighth Canonry'
                            – located at the southwest end of the cathedral nave, was built in the

                            centuries. Between the prior's personal house and the cathedral, there
                            are two halls, the prior's great hall and the cathedral great hall. The
                            prior's house had also a study and a kitchen, which joined the house to

                            ninth earl of Surrey, and Eleanor (d. 1372), daughter of Henry (<hi
                                rend="italic">c</hi> 1280–1345), second earl of Lancaster. At the
                            age of seventeen Arundel received his first benefice in Taunton,
                            Somerset, and was raised to the bishopric of Ely at the age of twenty,
                            on 13 August 1373. During the same time (perhaps about 1369) he began
                            his career at Oriel College, Oxford, leaving after his BA. Arundel's
                            political career is best defined by his actions as lord chancellor, 1386–9 and 1391–6, in which role he mediated disputes between

                            rights and privileges of parliament, and played a leading role in
                            Richard's deposition in favour of Henry IV in 1399. Arundel's political
                            actions led to subsequent ecclesiastical appointments. On 3 April 1388
                            Arundel was translated to the archbishopric of York, and on 25 September
                            1396 to the archbishopric of Canterbury. Arundel was subsequently
                            replaced by Roger Walden
                            (d. 1406) in 1397, after which he was exiled and fled to Florence. In
                            1398 Boniface IX translated Arundel to the bishopric of St Andrew's;
                            following Walden's deposition in 1399 by <rs ref="eats:32283"
                                type="Person_Male">Henry IV</rs>, Arundel was restored to
                            Canterbury, where he remained until his death on 19 February 1413/14.
                            Throughout his ecclesiastical career, Arundel was dedicated to pastoral
                            reform, acting when bishop of Ely as patron to a number of northern
                            clergy, including Richard Scrope (<hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1350–1405),
                            future archbishop of York, John Neuton (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>
                            1350–14), who became treasurer of York Minster, Henry Bowet (d. 1423),
                            also later an archbishop of York, and Augustinian mystic Walter Hilton
                                (<hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1342–96), all of whom were employed in
                            the Ely consistory court. Another mystic, Nicholas Love (d. 1424), wrote
                            his <title> Myrrour of the Blessed Lyf of Jesu Christ</title> and
                            presented it to Arundel, as archbishop of Canterbury, in 1411. Arundel's
                            patronage was designed to combat Lollardry, which was just beginning to
                            develop in the 1380s; indeed, Richard II's visit to King's Hall,

                            Ely as a seeming reward for diplomatic services from 1502 to 1515. He
                            served as bishop for eighteen years, the first decade of his episcopate
                            marked by continued work within the government, including ambassadorial
                            work in France and an attendance at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. West
                            was also closely involved in addressing heterodoxy at the University of
                            Cambridge – most notably in an excommunication of the University Senate
                            for opposing his jurisdictional authority in the late 1520s – a result
                            perhaps of earlier confrontations with Hugh Latimer, whose Lutheran
                            sympathies led him to preach against the worldliness of prelates. His
                            position as chaplain to <rs ref="eats:138362" type="Person_Royalty">Katherine of Aragon</rs> 
                            drew him again into national events during
                            the last years of his life. West was one of only three bishops to give
                            assent to the submission of the clergy in May 1532; nonetheless,
                            Katherine's retirement from London to his house in Hatfield indicates
                            their continued close relationship. An inventory at his death revealed a
                            library of approximately 250 volumes, and over 5000 ounces of silver and

                            collection and produced the first extant inventory of books in the
                            library, compiled in a register of benefactors (Kari Anne Rand,

                            During this time Wren also compiled a list of estate papers for the

                            Philip III's daughter, Maria Anna. Wren would later accompany Charles
                            for his coronation in Edinburgh in 1633. In 1625 Wren again turned to
                            historical record-keeping as master of Peterhouse, producing 'an
                            inventory for the treasury of the medieval college <gap reason="omitted"

                            Wren's archival work continued as dean of Windsor in 1628, bishop of
                            Hereford in 1634, bishop of Norwich in 1635, and finally bishop of Ely
                            in 1638. As bishop of Norwich and Ely, Wren also undertook a series of
                            visitations to ensure conformity, an effort curtailed in 1641 when he
                            was imprisoned in the Tower of London, where he stayed until 1660

                                MA on 2 July 1608. He was junior and senior treasurer, 1610 and 1611 respectively,
                                and bursar of the college, 1621–4. In 1615 he was household

                                he became bishop of Norwich, at which time he started work on
                                reform. In May 1638 he was sent to Ely and immediately sent out his
                                bill of inquiry, with the goal of ridding the county of Puritanism,
                                and the response was strong. On 27 December 1640 Wren was censured

                                on 15 March 1660. His final years marked a return to administration
                                in Ely; after his death on 24 April 1667, he was buried in

                            in 1453; after its dissolution in 1566, the guild's estates were taken
                            over by the Corporation and thus preserved (<title>VCH:

                            in a primitive building, with thatched roof, supposed to have stood on
                            the site of the present Grammar School, but its locality is not known
                            with certainty' (Frederic John Gardiner, <title>History of Wisbech and
