     <title>A Memoir of the Reverend Sydney Smith of Foston le Clay, North Riding, by his daughter, Lady Holland </title>(1855)</p>
    
    <p>Any REED collection is a collaborative effort, and given the geographical spread of the North Riding, this collection is more collaborative than usual. It gives me considerable pleasure, therefore, to thank the colleagues, researchers, and local historians who have assisted me in its preparation.</p>
    
    <p>The staff of the REED project at its Toronto office deserves pride of place for having to put up with me on a virtually daily basis. This includes Alexandra F. Johnston, founder and senior consultant (from 2011); Sally-Beth Maclean, director of research and general editor (from 2011); Patrick Gregory, palaeographer and Latinist; Tanya Hagen, bibliographer and copy editor; Sim Ong, bibliographical assistant; Kathy Chung, research associate and digital indexer; Carolyn Black, project manager to July 2020; Jamie Norrish, programmer; Illya Nokhrin, research assistant and digital indexer; Stephanie Hovland, UK research associate; Ga≈°per Jacovac, research assistant; Matthew Payne, UK research associate; and Byron Moldofsky, cartographer.</p>
    
    <p>Much of the burden of support for a REED editor comes from the staff of the libraries and archives in the UK, and my gratitude to the staff of the following repositories is deep: the Yorkshire North Riding Record Office, Northallerton,  especially to archivists Margaret Boustead and Thomas Richardson, who bore the brunt of shepherding me through the intricacies of the catalogue; the West Yorkshire Archive Service at both its Wakefield and Leeds offices; the library of the Yorkshire Archaeological and Historical Society and the University of Leeds' Brotherton Library, where the YAHS collection presently resides; the Library, University of York and the Borthwick Institute for Archives; the Library, York Minster; the Whitby Museum and its curator, Christiane Kroebel; the Richmond Guild of Mercers, Grocers, and Haberdashers and its clerk, Jamie Edgar.</p>
    
    <p>Beyond the bounds of Yorkshire, the bulk of my research has been at the National Archives at Kew, the British Library, the Cambridge University Library, the Bodleian Library, the Hatfield House Library, and the Chester and Cheshire Archives Service.
     Local Yorkshire historians have provided invaluable assistance: for the North Riding collection, I have been able to rely on the work of Dr. Jack Binns (Scarborough), Jane Hatcher (Richmond), Colin Hinson (Yorkshire CDbooks), and Ralph Waggett (Richmond guild records).</p>
    
    <p>North American libraries I have relied upon include the Huntington Library, and the following libraries at the University of Toronto: the Robarts Library, the Pontifical Institute for Mediaeval Studies Library, and the library of the Centre for Reformation and Renaissance Studies.</p>
    
    <p>Research during the pandemic has been made possible by several internet libraries, including HathiTrust, InternetArchive, and Google Books.</p>
    
    <p>Several of my colleagues have assisted with archival work when I was unable to get to the UK; they include John McKinnell (Durham), Diana Wyatt (East Riding), Mark Chambers (Durham), and Alan Nelson (Essex); many of these also provided hospitality when I was able to travel.</p>
    
    <p>This research would not have been possible without funding from a number of sources. The UK Arts and Humanities Research Council generously supported the North East editors with an annual research conference for five years, culminating in a volume of essays on early drama in the North East. In Canada, the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council provided research funding for several editors, myself included, and significant funding came from Father Edward Jackman and the Jackman Foundation.</p>
    
    <p>Finally, the North Riding collection is dedicated to the memory of my husband, Kenneth Luby, who put up with it all and even came to Durham.</p>

     <head>Topography</head>

     <p><rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/2417/" type="Place_County">Yorkshire</rs> is one of only two English counties whose size merited a three-fold division
      into ‚Äòridings‚Äô (from the Old Norse <hi rend="italic">√æri√∞jungr</hi> via Old English <hi rend="italic">√æri√∞ing</hi>), the three ridings ‚Äì <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/2453/" type="Place_County">North</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/2435/" type="Place_County">East</rs>, and
       <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/2471/" type="Place_County">West</rs> ‚Äì
      meeting at the city of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/37840/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">York</rs>.<note type="foot"><title>OED</title>, <hi rend="italic">sv</hi> 'riding, <hi rend="italic">n</hi>.2,' 1; Hey, <title>History of Yorkshire</title>,
       pp 65‚Äì6.</note> The North Riding comprised a vast area to the north of the city, consisting
      of two regions of very different topography divided by the fertile Vale of York. Along the
      Vale runs the Great North Road following the Roman Dere Street, the primary route from <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/36947/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">London</rs> to the north of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1715/" type="Place_Country">England</rs> and to <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/2741/" type="Place_Country">Scotland</rs>.
      The critical importance of this road as the major north-south thoroughfare can be seen in
      William Harrison‚Äôs 1587 outline of its course from <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/2849/" type="Place_County">Berwick</rs> to
       London.<note type="foot">William Harrison, <title>The Description of England</title>, G.
       Edelen (ed) (Ithaca, 1968), 400.</note> A number of documents in this collection refer to
      payments to <rs ref="eats:1243" type="Entertainer_Type">musicians</rs> and other <rs ref="eats:1261" type="Entertainer_Type">performers</rs> encountered on journeys from Yorkshire to London,
      following Harrison‚Äôs route.</p>
     <p>To the west of this arable land lie the Yorkshire dales, crisscrossed by limestone hills and
      small rivers, all draining eventually into the Humber. The thin topsoil of the dales makes the
      area unsuitable for large-scale crop farming and since the early Middle Ages their economy has
      been based on sheep farming and the production of wool. To the east of the Vale of York lies
      the difficult terrain of the Yorkshire moors where only exceptionally hardy breeds of sheep
      can be farmed and the principal vegetation is gorse and heather.<note type="foot">Butlin,
        <title>Historical Atlas</title>, pp 10‚Äì17, 143‚Äì147.</note> As Edward Miller notes, ‚Äò[t]he
      wild landscape was anything but completely tamed.‚Äô<note type="foot">Edward Miller, 'The
       Occupation of the Land: Yorkshire and Lancashire,' <title>The Agrarian History of England and
        Wales, vol 3, 1348‚Äì1500</title>, Edward Miller (ed) (Cambridge, 1991), 43.</note></p>
     <p>The boundaries of the North Riding have changed significantly since the period covered by
      this collection, especially between the North and West Ridings, and John Speed‚Äôs <!-- [2021-08-30] KC: #749 -->map of 1610
      will be taken as the principal guide to border placement.<note type="foot">Speed,
        <title>Counties of Britain</title>, pp 197‚Äì204.</note> Unlike the modern post-1974 boundary,
      which in many places follows roads and other man-made features, the early boundary tended to
      follow, as far as possible, rivers and streams.<note type="foot">O'Hare, 'Yorkshire
       Boundaries,' p 9.</note> Water courses could of course shift over time and in such cases
      boundaries tended to follow the rivers as their courses changed. Where such shifts have taken
      place Speed‚Äôs map will be used as the base.<note type="foot">Butlin, <title>Historical
        Atlas</title>, pp 243‚Äì6.</note></p>
     <p>The northern boundary of the riding was the most stable, following the River Tees from its
      estuary to the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/2345/" type="Place_County">Westmorland</rs> border, then heading south along the watershed to follow
      the Rivers Wharfe and Nidd eastwards, finally joining the River Ure to the city of York. East
      of York, the boundary with the East Riding followed the Rivers Derwent and Hertford to reach
      the North Sea again south of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/252519/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Scarborough</rs>. The marshy Derwent was the least stable of the
      riding‚Äôs border markers and its shifting course produced frequent movement of the boundary
      with the East Riding.<note type="foot">O‚ÄôHare, 'Yorkshire Boundaries,' pp 13‚Äì15.</note> As is
      apparent on the map, many of the dales that now lie within the county of North Yorkshire were
      previously in the West Riding, including Airedale, Wharfedale, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/253861/" type="Place_F_OpenArea">Nidderdale</rs>, and the eastern stretch of Wensleydale, where the boundary follows the
      River Ure from just south of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/251829/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Masham</rs> to York. The relationship of the old county
      demarcations to the major watersheds of the Ouse, Derwent, and Tees suggests that the North
      Riding distinctions between arable land and grazing land, between dale and moorland, tends to
      support Charles Phythian-Adams‚Äô designation of the whole of Yorkshire as a ‚Äòcultural
       province.‚Äô<note type="foot">Charles Phythian-Adams, 'Introduction: An Agenda for English
       Local History,' <title>Societies, Cultures and Kinship 1580‚Äî1850: Cultural Provinces and
        English Local History</title>, Charles Phythian-Adams (ed) (Leicester, 1993), 9‚Äì18; Butlin,
        <title>Historical Atlas</title>, p 119.</note></p>
     <p>Neither the dales nor the moors were conducive to the development of large urban centres and
      the North Riding had only two towns with royal or ancient borough charters: <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/252312/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Richmond</rs>, on the River Swale in the northern reaches of the Vale of York, which held
      its ancient charter of Count Alan III, and Scarborough, the principal North Riding seaport,
      which held its royal charter of <rs ref="eats:43967" type="Person_Royalty">Henry II</rs>. <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/249567/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Whitby</rs> held its privileges of the <rs ref="eats:27258" type="Collective_ClergyAndChurchwardens">abbot</rs> of Whitby and several other towns (<rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/251161/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Helmsley</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/251506/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Kirkby Moorside</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/252082/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">New

Beresford and H.P.R. Finberg, <title>English Medieval Boroughs: A Handlist</title>
       (Newton Abbot, 1973), 186‚Äì9.</note> Harrison lists only the following North Riding towns as
      boroughs: Scarborough, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/253758/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Boroughbridge</rs>, Thirsk, and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/249433/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Aldborough</rs>.<note type="foot">Harrison, <title>Description of England</title>, p
       156.</note></p>
     <p>Perhaps the most significant advantage to such status was permission to hold a regular
      market. The North Riding was well served with beast, corn, and wool markets; of the
      approximately fifty-four markets in Yorkshire as a whole, twenty-one were in the North Riding,
      including a major beast market for sheep and cattle at Northallerton. <rs ref="eats:267370" type="Person_Commoner">William Camden</rs> was
      impressed, describing it as ‚Äòthe throngest Beast-fair on <rs ref="eats:41016" type="CalendarDay_Liturgical">St. Bartholemew‚Äôs-day</rs> that I ever
       saw.‚Äô<note type="foot">William Camden, <title>Britannia: Or a Chorographical Description of
        Great Britain and Ireland, together with the Adjacent Islands</title>, Edmund Gibson (ed),
       vol 2 (London, 2nd ed, 1722), 914, col 2.</note> Many of the Yorkshire markets became highly
      specialized, and Henry Best in his 1641 farming handbook emphasized how important it was to
      send produce to the right market: ‚Äòwee sende our dodd reade wheate and massledine usually to
      Malton markette; our barley to <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/249941/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Beverley</rs> and <rs ref="eats:295335" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Pocklington</rs> in winter time, and to Malton in
       summer.‚Äô<note type="foot">Henry Best, <title>Rural Economy in Yorkshire in 1641, Being the

        York</title>, Charles Best Robinson (ed), Surtees Society, vol 33 (Durham, 1857),
       100.</note> A second advantage to burghal status was permission to hold a <rs ref="eats:43457" type="Entertainment_Type">fair</rs>, often on an
      annual basis, often linked to a patronal feast day or other local celebration. Both markets
      and fairs attracted performers, though unless they came into conflict with the law there is
      little evidence of them in the records. The presence of a substantial market did however
      guarantee the existence of a relatively well-travelled road, available to <rs ref="eats:254814" type="Collective_Troupe">playing companies</rs> as
      well as for the transport of animals and goods.<note type="foot">Butlin, <title>Historical

      and estates visited by travelling <rs ref="eats:8782" type="Entertainer_Type">players</rs>, so that most of their routes lay along lesser roads
      and drovers‚Äô tracks, as the maps of their tours show.<note type="foot">See maps of attested

     <p>The North Riding was one of England‚Äôs largest administrative units, its 225 parishes almost
      entirely agrarian, with a limited population and sparse development. Vast fields of pasture
      were punctuated by gentry homes, virtually all of them involved in farming, though in the
      depths of the moors and dales even these were thin on the ground.<note type="foot">Butlin,

     <p>It was not military action that brought an end to the Scottish wars, but the arrival of
      bubonic plague in the North Riding in March of 1349, though the lack of large urban centres
      and the thinly spread population tended to protect the North Riding from the highest levels of
      mortality. Large monastic establishments were especially vulnerable, but many North Riding
      monasteries were smaller and housed fewer clergy. The North Riding deanery of Cleveland lost
      approximately twenty-one percent of its population, while the mortality rate in the deanery of
      Dickering, which was largely in the East Riding but included the city of Scarborough and its
      environs, was about sixty-one percent.<note type="foot">Rawnsley and Singleton, <title>History

      <rs ref="eats:32403" type="Person_Royalty">Richard II</rs> in 1400. The so-called Wars of the Roses were not a conflict between the counties
      of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/2057/" type="Place_County">Lancashire</rs> and York, but a battle between aristocratic families for supremacy. Since
      both factions held extensive lands in both counties, geography was less important than power.
      So the Yorkist Nevilles, Mowbrays, and Scropes, and the Lancastrian Percys and Cliffords <!-- [2021-08-30] KC: #754 -->held
      lands both in the North Riding and elsewhere in the county. A final resolution to the dynastic
      struggles was not achieved until 1485, with the landing of <rs ref="eats:23807" type="Person_Royalty">Henry Tudor</rs> at Milford Haven and

       1991‚Äì2).</note> Since many of these foundations were constructed explicitly to provide space
      removed from urban life, the moorlands of the North Riding became preferred sites. These sites
      also became a principal focus of <rs ref="eats:43591" type="Person_Royalty">Henry VIII</rs>‚Äôs plan to dissolve the wealthy monasteries in
      favour of the crown. Monastic lands were sold to Henry‚Äôs friends and supporters and monastic
      buildings became homes to many of the North Riding‚Äôs most prominent families. Local resistance
      to this attack on traditional religion was inevitable. In October of 1536 the movement known
      as the Pilgrimage of Grace began in <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/2093/" type="Place_County">Lincolnshire</rs> and quickly spread to Yorkshire. With the
      support of Yorkshire families like the Nevilles, Percys, and Scropes, the rebellion led by
      <rs ref="eats:293954" type="Person_StatusOther">Robert Aske</rs> of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/249894/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Aughton</rs> in the East Riding came face-to-face with the government‚Äôs forces at
      <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/250463/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Doncaster</rs>. Royal promises of a free pardon and a parliament at York convinced Aske and his
      rebels to disband. A further rebellion gave the royal forces an excuse for widespread arrests
      (though it is unlikely that Henry had any intention of keeping his promises) and Aske was
      executed along with many others. The Pilgrimage set the tone for much of the rest of the
      century, as the spread of Protestantism led to the destruction of church furnishings, wall
      paintings, rood screens, and other signs of traditional religion.<note type="foot">Hey,

     <p>The Pilgrimage was less a coordinated rebellion than a series of local uprisings; for the
      North Riding, the centre of revolt was Richmond and the initial intent was to restore some of
      the smaller monastic establishments, like <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/250555/" type="Place_F_ReligiousHouse">Easby Abbey</rs> just southeast of Richmond. To their
      demands for the restoration of monastic houses, the leaders of the Richmondshire revolts soon
      added complaints focusing on excessive taxation and tenants‚Äô rights, presented as a series of

     <p>The North Riding moors, difficult for both access and travel, not only remained a centre of

      October of 1569 the earls of Northumberland and Westmorland <!-- [2021-08-30] KC: #757 -->led a rebellion centred on County
      <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1913/" type="Place_County">Durham</rs> and the North Riding. The earls issued a series of three proclamations defining their
      complaints and clarifying that the rebellion was both religious and political in character,
      demanding first the restoration of the old religion and second the dismissal of a host of new
      Protestant administrative appointments: 'forasmuch as diverse, disordered, and ill disposed
      persons about the Queen‚Äôs majesty have by their crafty and subtle dealing to advance
      themselves overthrown in this realm the true and catholic religion toward God, and by the same
      abuseth the Queen, disorder the realm, and now lastly seeketh to procure the destruction of

       citing TNA: SP 15/15, no 29(i).</note></p>
     <p>The second proclamation, issued a few days later, repeated the two principal complaints in
      more forceful language: '[w]hereas diverse new set up nobles about the Queen‚Äôs Majesty, have
      and do daily, not only go about to overthrow and put down the ancient nobility of this realm,
      but also have misused the Queen‚Äôs Majesty‚Äôs own person, and also have by the space of twelve

       word.'<note type="foot">Kesselring, <title>Northern Rebellion</title>, pp 59, n 35.</note> The
      third proclamation expanded the attack on the ‚Äònew men‚Äô in Elizabeth‚Äôs administration,
      carefully avoiding any attack on Elizabeth herself, but added the earls' concern over the
      succession to the throne in the new political climate, asking for ‚Äòthe reforming of certain
      disorders crept in by the abuse and malicious practice of sundry wicked and evil-disposed
      persons, to make known and understood to all manner of persons to whom of mere right the true
      succession of the Crown appertaineth.‚Äô<note type="foot">Hutton, <title>Correspondence</title>,
       pp 267‚Äì68.</note> Although the initial impetus for the rebellion came from the earls of
      Northumberland and Westmorland, it drew wide popular support; indeed, more than eighty percent

     <p>The rebellion was put down swiftly and Elizabeth‚Äôs retaliation was severe, with the North
      Riding bearing the brunt of her anger. There is extensive evidence that the rebellion had
      widespread popular support; the wide distribution of the rebel's origins is strikingly clear

      the official reaction once the rising was put down: executions were ordered to correspond to
      between sixteen and thirty-nine percent of the number of rebels in each town: so the Ryedale
      village of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/250931/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Gilling East</rs>, with 225 rebels, saw thirty-seven executions; Gilling West, with 141,

     <p>The North Riding, especially the moorlands, remained a hotbed of recusancy until well beyond

     <p>For the most part the Elizabethan settlement of 1559 was met with limited resistance, as the
      majority of those who remained Catholics lived as 'church papists,' attending the parish
      church regularly as required, while some continued to practice Catholic ritual in the privacy
      of their homes. As Hey points out, open practice of the Catholic faith was limited to the
      district of Richmondshire where half the gentry families were Catholic, and to the northern

      <p>The North Sea port of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/252519/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Scarborough</rs>, whose massive headland had made it a major Roman

       <rs ref="eats:294222" type="Person_Royalty">Harald Hardrada</rs> in 1066 is likely the reason for its absence from the Domesday Book. It took
       several generations to rebuild and the restored town was granted a charter as a royal borough
       (modelled on <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/37840/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">York</rs>) by <rs ref="eats:43967" type="Person_Royalty">Henry II</rs> in 1155, confirmed in 1163. Both the city‚Äôs <rs ref="eats:252542" type="Place_F_Residence">castle</rs>, built
       early in Henry‚Äôs reign, and its harbour were of major strategic importance. Lacking an

       Scarborough was thirtieth in the country in population, while Hull had risen to
       twenty-fourth. By the end of the fourteenth century Scarborough‚Äôs population was about 2,500,

      <p>The survival of the records of ecclesiastical administrations is in inverse proportion to
       the fragmentation of the administrative unit. The centralization of diocesan records,
       primarily in the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/253735/" type="Place_F_Church">minster</rs> at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/37840/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">York</rs>, provided a level of security not available to the records
       of smaller units. The records of visitations on the archidiaconal and archiepiscopal levels
       are extensive, though somewhat complicated by the changes in diocesan boundaries brought
       about by the Henrician reforms of 1540‚Äì2. Principal among these changes was the creation of
       the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/15612/" type="Place_EcclesiasticalArea">diocese of Chester</rs>, which conjoined the archdeaconries of Chester (<rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/37206/" type="Place_EcclesiasticalArea">diocese of Lichfield</rs>)
       and Richmond (<rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/214809/" type="Place_EcclesiasticalArea">diocese of York</rs>), placing the western half of the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/2453/" type="Place_County">North Riding</rs> in the diocese
       of Chester. The new diocese, initially in the province of Canterbury, was moved in 1542 to
        York.<note type="foot">Colin Podmore, <title>Dioceses and Episcopal Sees in England: A

       These changes led to some fragmentation of diocesan records, with those documents held by the
       former archdeaconries tending to remain there. The changes in diocesan boundaries are
       documented on the diocesan layer of the REED Online map. The records of the county's religious houses did not for the most part
       survive the Dissolution and the religious uprisings that followed, like the 1536 Pilgrimage

     <p>Much of the territory of the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/2453/" type="Place_County">North Riding</rs> lies on the North Yorkshire moors, inhospitable at
      best, impassable at worst. The North Riding was home to a substantial number of
      gentry; their estates, however, tended to lie off the moorland: in the Vale of York to the west, the
      Tees valley to the north, along the coast to the east, and the Derwent valley to the south.
      When <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/36947/" type="Place_PopulatedArea">London</rs>-based playing companies did venture north, they avoided the moors and found
      employment in the surrounding estates. The <rs ref="eats:265221" type="Person_Family">Fairfax family</rs> renovated their Great Hall at
      <rs ref="eats:250954" type="Place_F_Residence">Gilling Castle</rs> in the late 1570s and their household accounts record visits to the hall both
      before and after its renovation.<note type="foot">See the <ref target="https://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/search/?q=%22Kitchen+Accounts%22+%22Sir+William+Fairfax%22">records</ref> pertaining to the Kitchen Accounts of Sir William Fairfax.</note>. On 12 September

      Cholmeley hosted two companies with royal patents, the king's players and <quote source="#yksnr-ridp278538840">'an other company of

      <rs ref="eats:17496" type="Person_Royalty">James I</rs>'s accession in 1603. The other company of 'ye kinges servantes' is less clear. The
      word 'players' is notoriously ambiguous and this second company might be one of the groups of
      royal tumblers or <rs ref="eats:260242" type="Collective_Troupe">other performers</rs> who visited <rs ref="eats:37840" type="Place_PA_Settlement">York</rs> in the 1620s and 1630s.<note type="foot">Johnston and Rogerson (eds), <title>York</title>, vol 1, pp 568, 578, 580, 581, 593,

      period from 1610 to 1616 he attended fourteen performances by companies of players, both at

      derive from the kind of stand-up comedy monologues performed by the great Elizabethan stage
      clowns like Richard Tarleton, Richard Armin, and William Kemp. These monologues expanded first
      into dialogues, then into short plays with three or four characters, featuring traditional
      characters such as elderly husbands and young wives, clever servants, lecherous gentlemen, and
      foolish bumpkins. The jigs were entirely <rs ref="eats:10906" type="Entertainer_Type">sung</rs> to well-known tunes, principally using the music
      of the broadside ballad, and a small number of them survive.<note type="foot">Clegg and

      component of <rs ref="eats:18451" type="Entertainer_Type">dance</rs> as well as song.</p>
     <p>From the surviving jig texts, contemporary descriptions, and related material like the jest
      books, it seems clear that the purpose of a jig, whether following <rs ref="eats:40453" type="Drama_Type">a comedy or a tragedy</rs>, was
      to lighten the mood with a brash and often bawdy comic turn. The jigs were immensely popular,
      though not everyone was in favour of the practice. The playwright Thomas Dekker wrote in 1613,
      ‚ÄòI have often seene, after the finishing of some worthy Tragedy, or Catastrophe in the open
      Theaters, that the Sceane after the Epilogue hath been more blacke (about a nasty bawdy Iigge)

        Strange Horse-Race At the end of which, comes in The Catch-pols Masque</title> (London,

     <p>The law agreed with Dekker and the Westminster general session of the peace on 1 October
      1612 promulgated 'An Order for suppressinge of Jigges att the ende of Playes.'<note type="foot">John Cordy Jeaffreson (ed), <title>Middlesex County Records, vol 2,
        1603‚Äì25</title> (London, 1887), 83.</note> Although this order links the jigs directly with
      the London professional theatre, there is also evidence, as in the North Riding, of jigs in a
      provincial and local context. A number of the surviving provincial jigs had a specific
      purpose: the satirizing and humiliation of local (and identifiable) persons. Not surprisingly,
      our major source for this mode of jig lies in the legal documents associated with it. In 1602
      one <rs ref="eats:276689" type="Person_Commoner">Michael Steill</rs> (Protestant) of <rs ref="eats:252657" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Skelton-on-Ure</rs> brought action for <rs ref="eats:45521" type="CrimesMisdemeanors">libel</rs> against <rs ref="eats:276813" type="Person_StatusOther">Edward

      and <rs ref="eats:276875" type="Person_Commoner">Francis Mitchell</rs>. The Star Chamber depositions give the background. Bowes, Meynell's
      servant, deposed that Steill had <quote source="#yksnr-ridp273129816">'turned his wife from him to shift for herself, and did keep
      house together with his servant Frances and lived with her very suspiciously and in evil vice
      and fame.'</quote> The jig achieved some popularity. Bowes
      said he heard it sung by one <rs ref="eats:277873" type="Person_Commoner">Roger Bowlande</rs> and others in the village of <rs ref="eats:259371" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Grimscar</rs> and other

      the village of <rs ref="eats:252174" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Osmotherley</rs> at <rs ref="eats:239365" type="CalendarDay_Liturgical">Christmas</rs> 1601.<note type="foot">See <ref target="https://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/records/yksnr-ridp273383368/">Star Chamber Case: Steill v.

     <head>Popular Customs</head>
     <p>Records detailing popular customs are most commonly found in the records of individual
      parishes, especially in the accounts of <rs ref="eats:3576" type="Collective_ClergyAndChurchwardens">churchwardens</rs>, since many of them form a significant
      source of parish fundraising. In the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/2453/" type="Place_County">North Riding</rs>, however, only a very small number of such
      records survive, due in part at least to the wide spread of large rural parishes in the
      county. Balancing this loss, a number of popular customs are reflected in records other than
      parish documents. Ecclesiastical visitation records occasionally provide evidence of popular
      customs: on 9 September 1615 <rs ref="eats:295423" type="Person_Commoner">George Sherwin</rs> and <rs ref="eats:295358" type="Person_Commoner">George Pearson</rs> were cited for playing <rs ref="eats:35310" type="Entertainment_FolkCustom">Robin Hood</rs>

     <p>In his study of the <rs ref="eats:255611" type="Collective_Troupe">Simpson company</rs>, Boddy suggested that the initial impetus for the
      players might have derived from the custom of '<rs ref="eats:264104" type="Entertainment_Custom">plough stotts</rs>,' as described in 1817 by George
      Young:</p>
     <p>On <rs ref="eats:297490" type="CalendarDay_Secular">plough monday</rs>, the first monday after <rs ref="eats:296200" type="CalendarDay_Liturgical">twelfth day</rs> ... there is a procession of rustic
      youths dragging a plough, who, as they officiate for <hi rend="italic">oxen</hi> are called
       <hi rend="italic">plough-stots</hi>. They are dressed with their shirts on the outside of
      their jackets ... with knots or roses of ribbons fastened on their shirts and on their hats.
      Besides the plough draggers, there is a band of six, in the same dress, furnished with swords,
      who perform the sword-dance, while one or more musicians play on the fiddle or flute....
      During the dance, two or three of the company, called <hi rend="italic">Toms</hi> or <hi rend="italic">clowns</hi>, dressed up as harlequins in the most fantastic modes, having their
      faces painted or masked, are making antic gestures and movements to amuse the spectators;
      while another set called <hi rend="italic">Madgies</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Madgy-Pegs</hi>,
      clumsily dressed in women's clothes, and also masked or painted, go about from door to door,
      rattling old canisters in which they receive money.... They parade from town to town for two
      or three days, and the money collected is then expended in a feast or dance, to which the
      girls who furnished the ribbons and other decorations are invited. Sometimes the sword-dance
      is performed differently; a kind of farce, in which songs are introduced, being acted along
      with the dance. The principal characters in the farce are the <hi rend="italic">king</hi>, the
       <hi rend="italic">miller</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">clown</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">doctor</hi>. <rs ref="eats:250693" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Egton Bridge</rs> has long been the chief rendezvous for sword-dancers in this

      <p>The relationshops between the various members of the Eure family in this document is not entirely clear. 'Ralph' was a traditional name in the family, but those who were not knighted can be eliminated, and Sir Ralph Eure 'the younger' is likely to have been <rs ref="eats:278488" type="Person_Gentry">the Sir Ralph</rs> who was governor of <rs ref="eats:252542" type="Place_F_Residence">Scarborough Castle</rs>, killed at the battle of Ancrum Moor in 1545.
      His grandfather <rs ref="eats:300211" type="Person_Gentry">Sir Ralph</rs> died in 1540, so distinguishing between Sir Ralph the younger and elder would have been necessary (<title>HPO</title>, <ref target="https://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1509-1558/member/eure-%28evers%29-sir-ralph-1510-45">'Eure, Sir Ralph (by 1510‚Äì45),'</ref> accessed 28 December 2020). 
      John Eure is a problem. 'John' was a common name in the family, but only until 1393, and the visitations undertaken later in the century give no John Eure as either the brother-in-law of <rs ref="eats:278551" type="Person_Commoner">Edmond Wryght's wife</rs>, or of <rs ref="eats:278822" type="Person_Gentry">Lady Eure</rs>. Wryght was a <rs ref="eats:300316" type="Collective_Occupation">soldier</rs>, not a clergyman, so his occupancy of the parsonage at <rs ref="eats:253884" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Lyth</rs> would not indicate that he was the vicar rather than a tenant or householder (see Barker, 'The Eure Family,' pp 62‚Äì4).</p> 
       
      <p>'Roger' was a traditional name in
       the <rs ref="eats:300079" type="Person_Family">Cholmeley family</rs> and the man cited here is unlikely to be the <rs ref="eats:279918" type="Person_Gentry">Sir Roger</rs> who became <rs ref="eats:283573" type="Collective_Office">Lord
       Chief Justice</rs>, but rather <rs ref="eats:269165" type="Person_Commoner">his nephew</rs>.</p>

       <ab>In the monastery of this abbess there was a certain brother especially distinguished and
        honoured with a divine gift, since he was accustomed to make songs fittingly, which
        pertained to religion and piety, so that whatever he learned of sacred writing from
        scholars, those things after a moderate space of time he brought forth in poetic language
         <pb n="99v" type="folio"/> adorned with the greatest sweetness and inspiration and
        well-wrought in the English language. And by his songs the spirits of many men were kindled
        to contempt of the world and to a longing for the heavenly life. And likewise many others
        after him among the English people began to compose pious songs, but none however could do
        so in the same manner because it was not at all from men nor through man that he learned the
        art of song, but he was divinely aided and through God's gift received the art of poetry.
        And therefore he never could make any sort of lying or idle song, but only those which
        pertained to piety and those which were appropriate for his pious tongue to sing. The man
        was established in a secular life until the time when he was of advanced age and he had
        never learned any songs. And therefore, often at a feast when there was deemed to be
        occasion of pleasure so that they all must in turn sing with a harp, when he saw the harp
        coming near him, he then arose for shame from that feast and went home to his house. On a
        certain occasion when he did this, so that he left the banquet-hall and was going out to the
        animal stables, whose care had been assigned to him that night, when he there at a suitable
        time set his limbs at rest and fell asleep, then a man stood by him in a dream and saluted
        and greeted him and called him by his name: 'C√¶dmon, sing me something.' <pb n="100" type="folio"/> Then he answered and said: 'I do not know how to sing and therefore I went
        out from this feast and came hither, because I did not know how to sing at all.' Again he
        said, he who was speaking with him: 'Nevertheless, you must sing (for me).' Then he said:
        'What must I sing?' Said he: 'Sing to me of the first Creation.' When he received this
        answer, then he began immediately to sing in praise of God the Creator verses and words
        which he had never heard, whose order is this:</ab>

       <ab>Now we must praise / the Guardian of the heavenly kingdom,</ab>

       <ab>the might of the Measurer / and his mind's purpose,</ab>

       <ab>the work of the Father of glory, / as he, the eternal Lord,</ab>

       <ab>established the beginning / of all wonders.</ab>

       <ab>First he made the earth / for the children of men,</ab>

       <ab>heaven as a roof, / the holy Creator.</ab>

       <ab>Then the Guardian of mankind, / the eternal Lord,</ab>

       <ab>afterwards created / the world,</ab>

       <ab>the earth for men, / the almighty Lord.</ab>

       <ab>Then he arose from that sleep and all that which he sang while sleeping he had fast in
        his memory and he soon added in the same manner to those words many words of songs pleasing
        to God. Then in the morning he came to the town-reeve, who was his alderman. He told him
        what kind of gift he received, and he immediately led him to the abbess and made it known
        and described it to her. Then she ordered all of the most learned men and scholars to
        gather, and to those who were present commanded him to tell of that dream and sing that
        song, so that it might be determined by the judgement of all of them what that was and
        whence it had come. Then it was seen by all just as it was, that to him from God himself a
        heavenly gift had been given. Then they spoke to him and told some holy story and divine
        words of knowledge; they bade him then, if he could, that he turn that into poetic metre.
        Then, when he had undertaken it in this manner, then he went home to his house and came
        again in the morning and with the best adorned <pb n="100v" type="folio"/> song he sang and
        rendered what he was bid.</ab>

       <ab>Then the abbess began to embrace and love the gift of God in that man and she exhorted
        and advised him that he should abandon the worldly life and accept the life of a monastic,
        and he readily agreed to this. And she took him into the monastery, with his goods and
        received him into the community of God's servants and ordered that he be taught the sequence
        of holy stories and narratives. And he was able to learn all that he heard and, keeping it
        all in mind, just like a clean animal chewing cud, turned it into the sweetest song. And his
        songs and his poems were so beautiful to hear that his teachers themselves wrote and learned
        from his mouth. He sang first about the creation of the world and about the origin of
        mankind and all of the history of Genesis ‚Äì that is the first book of Moses ‚Äì and afterwards
        about the exodus of the people of Israel from the land of Egypt and their entry into the
        promised land, and about many other stories of the canonical books of holy scripture, and
        about Christ's incarnation and about his suffering and about his ascension into the heavens,
        and about the coming of the Holy Ghost and of the teaching of the apostles, and then about
        the day of coming judgement and about the terror of the tormenting punishment and about the
        sweetness of the heavenly kingdom, he wrought many songs. And so he also made many others
        about divine mercy and judgement. In all of them he eagerly sought to draw men away from the
        love of sin and evil deeds and to awaken in them the love and practice of good deeds. For he
        was a very devout man and humbly devoted himself to regular service. And against those who
        wished to do otherwise, he burned with a surging of great ardour. And for this reason with a
        beautiful end he closed and ended his life<gap reason="omitted"/></ab>

       <ab>In this abbess's monastery there was a certain brother by divine grace particularly renowned
        because he was wont to make songs suited to religion and piety, so that whatever he learnt
        from divine scripture through translators he would after a short time utter in his own
        tongue ‚Äì that is English ‚Äì in poetic words composed with the greatest sweetness and
        compunction. By his songs the souls of many were often incited to contempt of the world and
        desire for the life of heaven. And to be sure after him others among the English people also
        attempted to make religious poems but none was able to equal him. For he did not learn the
        art of singing instructed by men nor through a man, rather, divinely assisted, he freely
        received the gift of singing. Therefore he could not make any frivolous or vain poem, but
        only those which pertained to religion befitted his religious tongue. Since having been
        settled in the secular way of life until he was of an advanced age, he had never learnt
        anything of songs, therefore sometimes, at a feast, when it had been decided for the sake of mirth that all in
        their turn ought to sing, he, when he saw the harp approach him, would rise from the midst
        of the dinner and, leaving, return to his house.</ab>

       <ab>On one occasion when he did this, having left the banquet house, he went out to the
        oxen's stable, the care of which that night had been delegated to him, and there at the
        appropriate hour he gave up his limbs to sleep. Someone stood before him in a dream and,
        greeting him and calling him by his name, said 'Sing something for me.' But he said in
        response 'I don't know how to sing and for that reason I left the feast and took myself here
        because I could not sing.' In turn, he who was speaking with him said 'Nevertheless you have
        to sing for me.' 'What,' he said, 'should I sing?' And that one said 'Sing the beginning of
        created things.' And when he heard this response, at once he began to sing verses in praise
        of God, the maker, which he had never heard, the sense of which is this:</ab>

       <ab>Now ought we to praise the author of the kingdom of heaven,</ab>

       <ab>The power of the creator, and his purpose,</ab>

       <ab>The deeds of the father of glory, how he,</ab>

       <ab>Since he is eternal God, has been the author of all wonders,</ab>

       <ab>Who first for the sons of men</ab>

       <ab>Heaven for the summit of a roof,</ab>

       <ab>Then, the earth, the guardian of the human race,</ab>

       <ab>The all powerful created.</ab>

       <ab>This is the sense, however, not the actual order of the words he sang while sleeping, for
        songs, be they never so well composed, cannot be transferred from one language to another
        without detriment to their beauty and dignity.</ab>

       <ab>Rising from sleep, moreover, he retained in his memory all the things which he had sung while sleeping
        and soon added to them many more words in the same manner of a song worthy of God.</ab>

       <ab>In the morning, coming to the steward, who was his superior, he made known what gift he
        had received and, having been led to the abbess, he was ordered <pb n="91v" type="folio"/>
        to make his dream known and to recite the song to the many learned men who were present so
        that it might be shown to the judgement of all what that which he related was or of what origin it was. And it
        seemed to all that heavenly grace had been bestowed on him by the Lord. And they set forth a
        certain passage of sacred history or doctrine instructing him, if he could, to transform the
        same into the modulation of song. But he, having accepted the task, went away and when he
        came back in the morning returned what he was ordered composed in the most excellent song.
        Whereupon the abbess, soon embracing the grace of God in the man, instructed him to give up
        the secular way of life and to undertake the monastic rule, and, having taken him in, she added him to the company
        of brothers with her all her own and ordered that he be taught the series of sacred history.
        But by rehearsing with himself and like a clean animal chewing the cud, he converted all the
        things which he was able to learn by hearing into the sweetest song, and by sweetly
        resounding made his teachers in their turn his hearers. He sang moreover about the creation
        of the world and the origin of humankind and whole story of genesis, about the exodus of
        Israel from Egypt and the entry into the promised land and many other stories of holy
        scripture, about the Lord's incarnation, passion, resurrection, and ascension into heaven,
        of the coming of the Holy Spirit and the teaching of the apostles; likewise he made many
        songs about the terror of future judgement and the horror of the punishment of hell and
        sweetness of the kingdom of heaven, but also many others about the divine benefits and
        judgements in all of which (songs) he endeavoured to draw people away from the love of sin
        and spur them to the love but also the skilled application of good action. For he was a
        very religious man, humbly submissive to the disciplines of the order, but inflamed with a
        zeal of great vehemence against those who wished to do otherwise, for which reason he
        concluded his life with a beautiful end<gap reason="omitted"/></ab>
