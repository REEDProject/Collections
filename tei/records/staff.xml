        <p>Records of Early English Drama (REED) is an international scholarly project that is
          establishing for the first time the context from which the drama of Shakespeare and his
          contemporaries grew. Founded in 1976, REED has worked since then to locate, transcribe,
          and edit historical documents containing evidence of drama, secular music, and other
          communal entertainment and ceremony from the Middle Ages until 1642, when the Puritans
          closed the London theatres.</p>

          <p>This is the first digital collection published by REED, but the records research upon
            which it is based has a long history. The project was originally designed and undertaken
            in 1979, to investigate Shropshire and Staffordshire together, publishing the results as
            a single collection. Checking and other activities proceeded in tandem for both county
            collections, and the initial round of review activities was completed; however, at this
            late stage it was decided that the Shropshire records themselves would be sufficient to
            form a collection, and this was subsequently published (2 vols, 1994). Staffordshire was
            laid aside, other priorities intervened, and considerable time has passed.</p>
          <p>As a result, this Staffordshire collection has lived two separate lives: its original
            one (1979–92) and its present digital revival. The Social Sciences and Humanities
            Research Council of Canada’s research grant, for which thanks were offered in the
            Shropshire volumes, was in fact a grant for the project including Staffordshire; now
            that the latter collection is completed I have the happy opportunity to express, once
            again, my deep gratitude to the Council for the financial support of its grant. And
            again I am delighted to thank the Jackman Foundation, by courtesy of Reverend Edward
            Jackman, OP, for its continued support of the REED enterprise.</p>
          <p>Two people instrumental in the original stage of this project continue to flourish as
            sources of inspiration and guidance as we near the publication online of the
            Staffordshire records. Alexandra Johnston, REED’s founder, continues to inspire, guide,
            and facilitate as REED moves into new territory undreamed at its beginning. Sally-Beth
            MacLean and I went on from Shropshire to become (as we continue to be) co-directors of
            the REED Patrons and Performances website, a project that daily convinces its users that
            reference data has its true home in digital databases. Sally-Beth continues to oversee
            the REED staff, to encourage the editors, and to coordinate the project with her amazing
            energy and wisdom, and I am most grateful for her advice and support.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the present Staffordshire project, I would like to begin where records
            research always begins, in the field at the archives, record offices, and other
            repositories (public and private), in which I have gathered the materials for this
            collection. In all of these places I have appreciated and profited from the helpful

          <p>This second phase of Staffordshire has involved re-checking of doubtful issues in
            various documents, as well as chasing down sometimes tenuous leads to elusive newly
            uncovered sources of evidence. I am very grateful for the invaluable advice,
            encouragement, and expertise (always cheerfully offered!) of two experts: Dr Nigel
            Tringham, County Editor of the Victoria County History of Staffordshire, and Professor
            Alan Nelson. Working just across the county boundary, on their own collection of the
            Derbyshire records, have been Barbara Palmer and John Wasson, both (alas) no longer with
            us. We shared in numerous discussions about the multifarious branches of the Ferrers
            families in Derbyshire, Staffordshire, and Warwickshire; as well, they were immensely
            helpful with documents in the Folger Shakespeare Library. On-site re-checking in various
            English repositories has been cheerfully undertaken by Jessica Freeman, Stephanie
            Hovland, and Simon Harris.</p>
          <p>The exacting tasks of re-scrutinizing the record collection, replacing the (now
            archaic) REED typesetting symbols with TEI encoding, and creating a user-friendly
            digital interface have occupied the time and talents of many staff members at the REED
            office. My email inbox has been daily filled with wise suggestions and perceptive
            requests as this work has gone forward. I am delighted to offer my thanks to them all:
            Carolyn Black (project management and copy editing), Patrick Gregory (paleographic
            checking, Latin and Anglo-French glossaries and translations), Abigail Young
            (paleographic checking), Kathy Chung (data tagging and EATS taxonomy), Janine Harper
            (English glossary, proofreading, mapping research), Theodore DeWelles, Tanya Hagen, Cai
            Henderson, and Peter O'Hagan (bibliographic research), Byron Moldofsky (creation of
            maps), Jamie Norrish (software development and programming), and William Ingram
            (creation of readers' package). Finally, James Cummings and Jamie Norrish repeatedly
            shared their expertise in all things digital, guiding us through the tricky processes of
            TEI encoding.</p>
          <p>Finally, in my Shropshire acknowledgments I recorded how that volume progressed as our
            family grew, and grew up assisting me, with the REED project in their veins. The
            children, now adults, have departed to their own careers and families and REED is just,
            for them, a (I hope happy!) memory. Only one remains, Felicity, my dear wife for fifty
            years, and for all of those fifty a source of staunch support, encouragement, and love.
            I dedicate this collection, with love, to her.</p>

          <p>Two novelists, separated by approximately a century, have offered imaginative
            descriptions of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1008/" type="Place_County">Staffordshire</rs>. Arnold Bennett begins his <title>The Old
              Wives’ Tale</title> (1908) with an impression of the county where his heroines, Sophia
            and Constance Baines, were born and raised: ‘The county is happy in not exciting remark.
            It is content that Shropshire should possess that swollen bump, the Wrekin, and that the
            exaggerated wildness of the Peak should lie over its border. It does not desire to be a
            pancake like Cheshire. It has everything that England has, including thirty miles of
            Watling Street; and England can show nothing more beautiful and nothing uglier than the
            works of nature and the works of man to be seen within the limits of the county. It is
            England in little, lost in the midst of England, unsung by searchers after the extreme;
            perhaps occasionally somewhat sore at this neglect, but how proud in the instinctive
            cognizance of its representative features and traits!’<note type="foot">Arnold Bennett,

            recently, Julian Barnes begins his <title>England, England</title> (1998) with the
            heroine, Martha Cochrane, thinking about her first remembrance: her ‘Counties of
            England’ jigsaw puzzle, about which she recalls ‘how most of the large, clear counties
            were round the edge, and when you put them in it left an awkward muddle of smaller,
            odd-shaped counties in the middle, and you could never remember where Staffordshire
              went.’<note type="foot">Julian Barnes, <title>England, England</title> (London, 1998),
              5.</note></p>
          <p>Staffordshire is, at 11,712 square miles, certainly not the smallest of English
            counties, and its central Midlands location (bordered by Leicestershire, Warwickshire,
            Worcestershire, Shropshire, Cheshire, and Derbyshire) certainly puts it ‘in the middle.’
            (Following REED practice, the historic, pre-1974 boundaries of the county are used
            here.) Staffordshire’s central location, rich mineral resources (coal, iron, and clay),
            and resourceful population have, since the industrial revolution in the eighteenth
            century, propelled the county’s economic prosperity; the southern industrial district
            (the Black Country) became the centre of iron and steel manufacturing in all its
            branches. By the 1901 census Staffordshire ranked fourth among English counties.<note type="foot"><title>VCH: Staffordshire</title>, vol 1, pp 275–7.</note> However, this
            prosperity came later; the fortunes of Staffordshire were distinctly poorer, and its
            population more scattered, from the Norman invasion to the end of our period.</p>
          <p>The area was invaded in the sixth century by a tribe of Angles who settled around <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/3900/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Tamworth</rs>, a borough that later became an important royal centre for kings of
            Mercia. Danish invaders frequently overran the area in the tenth century, before the
            land of the south Mercians was organized into five shires, including Staffordshire, by
            Edward the Elder, before 924.<note type="foot"><title>VCH: Staffordshire</title>, vol 1,
              pp 217–22.</note> Staffordshire, with <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/2237/" type="Place_County">Shropshire</rs>, revolted against the rule of William the Conquerer in 1069 and this
            was punished with ruthless confiscation – no Englishman retained any estates of
            importance in Staffordshire after the Conquest. The most important beneficiaries of the
            Conquest were Henry de Ferrers, who held <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/37265/" type="Place_F_Residence">Tutbury castle</rs>, and Robert de Stafford; de Stafford’s descendants long remained
            influential in the shire’s affairs.</p>
          <p>The Domesday survey supplies ways to measure the relatively depopulated and
            impoverished state of the county. The surveyors found Staffordshire to be 'thinly
            inhabited, incapable of ordinary taxation, and badly stocked,' Staffordshire was
            assessed with 540 or 555 hides. In comparison <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1949/" type="Place_County">Gloucestershire</rs> had 2,388 hides, and only <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/2219/" type="Place_County">Rutland</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1823/" type="Place_County">Cornwall</rs>, and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/43568/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Chester</rs> had smaller assessments. <note type="foot"><title>VCH:
                Staffordshire</title>, vol 1, p 222; vol 4, p 3.</note> Norman Staffordshire was
            largely waste and uncultivated lands. By the end of the twelfth century, four large
            royal forests, Brewood, Cannock, Kinver, and New Forest, had been created and covered
            approximately forty per cent of the shire, and Needwood, a non-royal forest, occupied
            about another ten per cent), as one can see by looking at a map of the extent of these
              forests.<note type="foot"><title>VCH: Staffordshire</title>, vol 2, p 335; vol 14, pp
              336, 350.</note> In 1300–1 writs issued to tenants who held £40 or more in land
            provide an approximate basis for comparison of the wealth of shires; of 835 writs for
            England (exclusive of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1913/" type="Place_County">Durham</rs> and Chester), Staffordshire furnished seventeen,
            Shropshire eleven, and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1877/" type="Place_County">Devon</rs> (the best showing) seventy-seven.<note type="foot"><title>VCH: Staffordshire</title>, vol 1, p 230.</note> The north Staffordshire
            moorlands provided excellent pasturage for sheep, and in the fourteenth century <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/4008/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Wolverhampton</rs> was a staple town for wool. The 1332–3 subsidy returns allow
            comparisons between the shire’s boroughs: <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1309/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Stafford</rs> was assessed at £13 8s, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/3702/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Lichfield</rs> at £12, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/3792/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Newcastle under Lyme</rs> £10 3s 4d, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/3411/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Burton</rs> £8 and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/3936/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Walsall</rs> £3 16s.<note type="foot"><title>VCH:

              152–67.</note> None of these is a large sum. The county continued to be hampered by
            its geography, which presented difficulties for transport. The Roman road in the south
            of the county, Watling Street, had fallen into disuse, and the roads in the north and
            south parts of Staffordshire (where developing industry was centred) remained poor
            throughout our period.<note type="foot"><title>VCH: Staffordshire</title>, vol 1, p
              276.</note> The only river of any note, the Trent, was not navigable within
            Staffordshire; until the advent of canals (in the 1770s) and later the railways,
            businesses in Staffordshire were limited to particular locales.<note type="foot"><title>VCH: Staffordshire</title>, vol 2, p 71.</note> In 1637 the county justices
            described Staffordshire as follows: ‘one-fourth being heath and waste and another fourth
            being chases and parks; it also abounds with poor people.'<note type="foot"><title>VCH:

              17, p 214 (Walsall).</note>At later points in our period it is possible to gain some
            insight into the comparable economic fortunes of Staffordshire boroughs. In 1573 the
            shire was described, in the returns of a muster roll, as being ‘too poor to support the
            expense of training a large number of men.’<note type="foot"><title>VCH:
                Staffordshire</title>, vol 1, p 275.</note> This was at the time of our early
            surviving narrative impression of the economic state of Stafford, contained in the vivid
            account of the visit by <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/11772/" type="Person_Royalty">Queen Elizabeth</rs> to the town in 1575. In 1635 the Ship Money
            assessment provides late comparative data: Lichfield, which had by that time clearly
            become the most prosperous urban centre in Staffordshire, was assessed at £100, Walsall
            £25, Stafford £20, and Newcastle £16.<note type="foot"><title>VCH:
              Staffordshire</title>, vol 1, p 288.</note></p>
          <p>As the comparative figures from various dates suggest, the varying fortunes of
            Staffordshire’s four main boroughs produced no clear leader, in contrast to Norfolk
            (Norwich), Somerset (Bristol), or Warwickshire (Coventry). The fortunes of the town of
            Stafford appear to have remained meagre and its population low. Parliamentary
            representation began regularly in 1552–3, when Lichfield, Newcastle, and Stafford each
            sent two members, with two members returned for the county. Tamworth returned two
            members beginning in 1563.<note type="foot"><title>VCH: Staffordshire</title>, vol 1, pp

          <p>The 'diocese of Coventry and Lichfield' is the name by which this oft-renamed diocese
            was known through much of the period of this collection of records and beyond
              (1224–1661).<note type="foot"><title>VCH: Staffordshire</title>, vol 3, pp
              1–43.</note> The diocese was founded in 656, with Diuma as its first bishop, as the
            diocese of Mercia, and it then contained much more territory than it did by the end of
            our period. The see was moved to Lichfield by <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/43705/" type="Person_Clergy">Ceadda</rs> (St Chad) in 669, when Ceadda built a small church and monastery there
            and fixed it as his headquarters.<note type="foot"><title>VCH: Staffordshire</title>,
              vol 1, p 218.</note> It was then renamed as the diocese of Lichfield. Soon after that
            the diocese underwent its first reduction in size, when the diocese of Worcester was
            detached, and by 750 the still-immense diocese covered <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1859/" type="Place_County">Derbyshire</rs>, Staffordshire, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1805/" type="Place_County">Cheshire</rs>, and part of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/2327/" type="Place_County">Warwickshire</rs>. In 1075 following earlier decrees from the councils of Sardica and
            Laodicea, the council of London decreed that all cathedral seats should be located in
            cities, resulting in the relocation of Sherborne (to Salisbury), Selsey (to Chichester),
            and Lichfield (to Chester); consequently the see was moved to Chester and the diocese
            was renamed as the diocese of Chester and Lichfield. It comprised five archdeaconries:
            Chester, Coventry, Derby, Salop, and Stafford. In 1102 the see moved once more, to <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/37701/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Coventry</rs>, this time at the behest of the ambitious bishop, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/43753/" type="Person_Clergy">Robert
              de Limesey</rs>. The diocese was shortly after renamed as the diocese of Coventry and
            Lichfield, and there ensued periodic quarrels between the monastic chapter of Coventry
            and the secular chapter of Lichfield about which should have primacy of election of
            successive bishops. This struggle was settled in 1228 by an agreement to alternate and
            share responsibilities, and the bishop was styled bishop of Coventry and Lichfield until
            the Reformation.<note type="foot"><title>VCH: Staffordshire</title>, vol 3, pp 1–4,
              7–12, 30–1.</note> The present <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/36465/" type="Place_F_Church">cathedral of Lichfield</rs> dates from 1200–1350, built within a fortified close with
            a moat. In 1535, the <title>Valor Ecclesiasticus</title> valued the diocese at £703 5s.
              3d.<note type="foot"> John Le Neve, <title>Fasti Ecclesiæ Anglicanæ 1541–1857: Vol 10,
                Coventry and Lichfield Diocese</title>, Joyce M. Horn (ed) (London, 2003), 1.</note>
            The struggle for primacy between Coventry and Lichfield was finally resolved in 1539
            when the Benedictine Cathedral Priory of St Mary in Coventry was dissolved, the see was
            moved to Lichfield only, and the bishop was thereafter styled the bishop of Lichfield
            and Coventry. The last administrative change that falls within our period was the
            creation in 1541 of the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/15612/" type="Place_EcclesiasticalArea">diocese of Chester</rs>, which entailed the transfer
            to that diocese of the archdeaconry of Chester.</p>
          <p>Within the diocese, Staffordshire formed the archdeaconry of Stafford and included the
            deaneries of Stafford, Newcastle, Alton and Leek, Tamworth and Tutbury, and Lapley and
            Trysull. Documentary remains of monastic foundations are generally slight, and there
            survive no records containing material relevant to this collection. The largest abbey in
            Staffordshire, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/39449/" type="Place_F_Church">Burton Abbey</rs>, was reckoned by its monks to be the smallest
            and poorest Benedictine establishment in the country. It was dissolved in 1539, and by
            1546 was owned by the <rs ref="eats:298017" type="Person_Family">Paget family</rs>, whose residency there after 1573 is recounted
            below.</p>
          <p>Attempting to gauge prevailing religious attitudes in Staffordshire is difficult
            because the surviving records are sparse; however, at the Reformation the county was
            little disposed to religious change, suggesting that it was not a hotbed of Reforming
              zeal.<note type="foot"><title>VCH: Staffordshire</title>, vol 3, pp 38, 43.</note>
            Further, the ecclesiastical centre of the county, Lichfield, was targeted particularly
            harshly because its moated cathedral, fortified and defensible, was a key strategic
            position, control over which was vital. Hence Lichfield saw some of the fiercest
            fighting of the wars. The cathedral suffered three sieges between 1643 and 1646; it
            changed hands from Royalists to Parliamentarians in 1643, after which the
            Parliamentarians destroyed the library, the glass, statuary, and organs. Retaken by
            Royalist forces forty-seven days later, the cathedral remained in Royalist hands almost
            to the end of the Civil War, when it fell a third time in 1646, after a fierce fight
            that resulted, among other things, in the collapse under bombardment of the central
            spire; the cathedral remained under Parliamentary control until 1660. During this second
            occupation, looting by the Parliamentary army resulted in much of the cathedral, now
            partly ruinous, being further damaged. The contents of the cathedral library were
            dispersed after the surrender of 1646, and the Civil War has been blamed for the
            disappearance of the early records of the corporation.<note type="foot"><title>VCH:
                Staffordshire</title>, vol 1, pp 259–61, 264; vol 14, pp 17–18.</note> As a result
            there survive only sparse cathedral and diocesan records from our period, and few civic
            records survive from the city of Lichfield.</p>

            reasons for this paucity in <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1008/" type="Place_County">Staffordshire</rs> (where reasons can be found) are diverse. In
            any event two boroughs that one might expect to find under discussion, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/3900/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Tamworth</rs> and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/4008/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Wolverhampton</rs>, are missing here because of their
            complete (or almost complete) lack of surviving documents. In the latter case, only a
            churchwardens’ account survives.</p>
          <p>The varied parishes, villages, and small towns scattered through the countryside
            enjoyed little organized local government, and so the records that survive illustrating
            rural life come from county quarter sessions, ecclesiastical court records (themselves
            not numerous, for Staffordshire), or rare prosecutions in the court of Star Chamber. The

            or pattern conclusions are impossible. Individual occurrences are often vivid and full
            of detail, such as the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/45595/" type="CrimesMisdemeanors">charivari</rs> at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/3411/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Burton upon Trent</rs> in 1616, or the continuing troubles with the scofflaw, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/8942/" type="Person_Commoner">Thomas

            protest at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/3684/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Kinver</rs> in 1620, where <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/10814/" type="Person_Commoner">Richard
              Rice</rs> was cited ‘for fartinge &amp; pissinge in the Church in sermon time &amp;

            <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/42342/" type="Thing_MusicalInstrument">bells</rs>!' Was he protesting the requirement to
            attend church in sermon time? Or the quality of the sermon? Or the Kinver minister’s
            negative attitude to <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/79074/" type="Entertainment_Custom">Morris</rs> <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/18451/" type="Entertainer_Type">dancing</rs> and merrymaking? One might be tempted to
            correlate cases like this one into a picture of anti-Puritan resistance, but this would
            be a dangerous generalization given the small number of scattered examples, which can be
            countered by other records that provide evidence of communities that were solidly and
            contentedly Puritan in sympathies. One is best advised to enjoy these glimpses of the
            quotidian lives of the people for themselves, on their own terms.</p>

            <p>As mentioned above, the dire straits of Lichfield’s struggles during the Civil Wars
              led to the almost utter destruction of its records and the waste of Lichfield
              Cathedral – what survive are some miscellaneous transcripts of letters, documents, and
              other materials (many of them dealing with matters concerning heraldry), made by Elias
              Ashmole after the Restoration, and preserved among the Ashmolean manuscripts in the
              Bodleian Library. No materials relevant to this collection have been found therein.
              One of the smallest cathedral cities, Lichfield was an ecclesiastical centre by the
              seventh century although, as noted above, its fortunes as a cathedral city were not
              assured until 1539, shortly before it received charters; ‘it was incorporated by royal
              charter in 1548, the corporation consisting of two bailiffs and twenty-four brethren.’
              In 1553 Queen <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/43849/" type="Person_Royalty">Mary</rs> issued a new charter ‘confirming the 1548 charter
              and in addition granting county status to the city with its own sheriff.’<note type="foot"><title>VCH: Staffordshire</title>, vol 14, pp 14–15; p 102, n 89, refers
                to LRO: B/A/21/CC 124075, mb 4.</note> Its triple spires gave Lichfield Cathedral a
              striking appearance, unique among English cathedrals.</p>
            <p>A local ceremonial, the Greenhill Bower Procession, originates in the fifteenth
              century. The earliest description is by Stebbing Shaw in the 1790s, although it is
              mentioned earlier by other writers (Eustace Hustocke, bailiff of Lichfield from 25
              March 1459 – 29 September 1459, refers to it in his accounts). It is still being held,
              on spring Bank Holiday Monday.<note type="foot"><title>VCH: Staffordshire</title>, vol
                14, pp 102, 159–60.</note></p>
            <p>Perhaps because of its central location midway between <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/36947/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">London</rs> and the north, at the junction of Ryknild Street and Watling Street,
              Lichfield received <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40648/" type="Entertainment_Type">royal visits</rs> on numerous occasions: beginning with
                <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/43967/" type="Person_Royalty">Henry II</rs> in 1175–81, followed by <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/23747/" type="Person_Royalty">John</rs> and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/44102/" type="Person_Royalty">Henry III</rs> in the next century, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/44180/" type="Person_Royalty">Edward II</rs> in 1309, 1323, and 1326, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/30996/" type="Person_Royalty">Edward III</rs> in 1328 and 1348, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/32403/" type="Person_Royalty">Richard II</rs> in 1386, 1397, and 1398–9 (on this occasion tournaments were held
              daily, and a banqueting house was built next to the bishop’s palace). <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/32283/" type="Person_Royalty">Henry IV</rs> visited in 1403 and 1404, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/44278/" type="Person_Royalty">Edward IV</rs> in 1461 and 1473 (a visit lasting over two weeks), and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/23807/" type="Person_Royalty">Henry VII</rs> in 1485 (immediately following his victory at Bosworth).<note type="foot"><title>VCH: Staffordshire</title>, vol 14, pp 11–12, 14, 59.</note> The
              visit that is of chief interest (because a copy of the accounts of expenses for the
              visit survives) is that of Queen <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/11772/" type="Person_Royalty">Elizabeth</rs> in 1575. It is unfortunate that no descriptive account of the
              activities survives. The queen was on a progress which brought her from <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/36077/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Kenilworth</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/2327/" type="Place_County">Warwickshire</rs>, and which saw her go on to visit,
              successively, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/38549/" type="Place_F_Residence">Chartley Manor</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1309/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Stafford</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1291/" type="Place_F_Residence">Stafford Castle</rs>, and thence onward towards <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/36191/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Worcester</rs>. (Further details about this progress are found under ‘Royal Visits’
              below.)</p>
            <p>Trades carried on within Lichfield in the period were, as elsewhere, local in scope,
              and hence the clothing, leather, and hospitality trades were predominant. Naming a
              dominant trade is difficult because of the lack of records. A list of men indicted for
              an affray <hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1509 included ‘19 cappers, 11 tailors, 6 weavers, 4
              shearmen, 3 glovers, 2 dyers, a corviser, and a skinner; 3 spurriers, 3 smiths, and 3
              cutlers; 4 bakers and 4 butchers.’<note type="foot"><title>VCH: Staffordshire</title>,
                vol 14, pp 120–1.</note> This may indicate nothing more than the argumentative
              natures of the individuals involved, rather than providing a random sample. Lacking a
              long-form census, we can draw no conclusions. The <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/11325/" type="Collective_GuildOccupational">Corvisers’ company</rs>, which appears to have been one of the minor guilds, is the
              only one for which we have surviving records, and these include an annual guild <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40561/" type="Entertainment_Type">dinner</rs>, with a minstrel, from 1562–3 until 1598–9.</p>
            <p>Scattered records from elsewhere provide fleeting glimpses of what may have been
              flourishing entertainment activities in Lichfield, but we cannot be sure. In 1488–9 a
                <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/12982/" type="Entertainer_Type">fiddler</rs> was listed as a member of St Mary's Guild.

            <p>Located on the River Sow, at the geographical centre of Staffordshire twenty-four
              miles north-west of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/44381/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Birmingham</rs>, Stafford was founded in 913 by <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/23708/" type="Person_Royalty">Æthelflæd</rs>, and Domesday records that the town had 128 occupied houses. It grew
              slowly to the end of our period, and was several times noted to be in economic
              difficulties. In 1540 Stafford was listed ‘among a number of towns where many houses
              were in a dangerous state of repair,’ and in 1575 Queen Elizabeth found on her visit
              that the fortunes of the town were parlous.<note type="foot"><title>VCH:
                  Staffordshire</title>, vol 6, pp 185–6. </note> In 1622, 384 households were

              concerted investigation into Stafford’s economic difficulties and slow growth has
              identified periods of crisis (when burials exceeded baptisms): 1596–8, 1603–4,
              1611–16, 1635–6, and 1639–41. Persistent visitations of plague extended throughout our
              period, and a catastrophic plague in the 1640s meant that Stafford’s overall rate of
              population increase was lower than other Staffordshire boroughs.<note type="foot">

              behind Stoke upon Trent, Tamworth, and Newcastle under Lyme.</p>
            <p>Lack of early borough records results in many early details of Stafford’s
              organization being shrouded in obscurity. The earliest charter appears to be from
              1206, when the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/23747/" type="Person_Royalty">king</rs> granted a charter as a free borough with a borough
              court and view of frankpledge; apparently this charter was confirmed without changing
              its essential details in future years.<note type="foot"><title>VCH:
                  Staffordshire</title>, vol 6, p 222.</note> By 1275 two <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/10976/" type="Collective_Occupation">bailiffs</rs> were the town's chief officers, and this
              continued until 1614, when a new charter changed the government to a single <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1140/" type="Collective_Occupation">mayor</rs>, a change that was accomplished amidst much
              division.</p>
            <p>When reading through Stafford borough records, one labours under the difficulty that
              the three sources of information available are all transcriptions or digests of
              sixteenth-century records, together with contemporary transcriptions of records from
              the seventeenth century. STRO: D 1323/E/1 presents further complexities because it
              gives, in its successive pages, accounts of bailiffs or the mayor, chamberlains, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/3576/" type="Collective_ClergyAndChurchwardens">churchwardens</rs>, and schoolwardens (the
              latter minor officials apparently all reported to the bailiffs or mayor).</p>
            <p>Our earliest record presents an attempt, by the seventeenth-century writer, to make
              some sense of a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40786/" type="Entertainment_Custom">hobby-horse</rs> record from 1528–9. The
              hobby-horse dance was held annually, at the new year, and receipts from it were
              entered by the churchwardens of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/36054/" type="Place_F_Church">St
                Mary's</rs>, first recorded in 1528–9 (the first surviving set of accounts) and last
              mentioned in 1638. It was a festive way to raise money.<note type="foot">Johnson,
                ‘Hobby-Horse,’ 60, 62–3. </note> Then we are catapulted forward to an (eyewitness?)
              account of Queen Elizabeth’s visit in 1575 (see ‘Royal Visits’ below), and thence to
              accounts for 1609–10, at which point the entries become contemporary. Easily the most
              verbose record in this series is the remarkable narrative of King James’s visit to
              Stafford in 1617, which is discussed separately, among ‘Royal Visits.’ From the outset
              of these annual accounts there are plentiful payments to touring professional
              entertainers, so there is no reason to doubt that there were numerous prior records,
              which are lost. One’s impression, surveying these records from 1609 to 1642, is
              continuity; the pattern of local customs, payments to professional entertainers, and
              the like is unchanging. The playing place used by visiting <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/8782/" type="Entertainer_Type">players</rs> is difficult to discern before 1617, since it is never mentioned and
              we can only assume that it was the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/36656/" type="Place_F_TownHall">town
                hall</rs>. As part of the preparations for King James’s royal visit in August 1617,
              the mayor and council decided to build a new stone town hall, in the marketplace, to
              afford a fit location for a royal <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40561/" type="Entertainment_Type">banquet</rs>. The banquet did not take place, but the hall, a raised hall on
              pillars, doubtless provided a venue for players and other <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1261/" type="Entertainer_Type">entertainers</rs>. Its covered ground floor could provide space for a market, and
              also probably for the ‘beare hole.’</p>
            <p>One intriguing series of three payments, spaced over more than a decade, refer to
              this ‘beare hole.’ Of course, ‘beare’ could be ‘beer,’ as in a
              reward of ‘plentye of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40997/" type="Thing_FoodDrink">wyne</rs> and beare’ to the mayor’s train after King James
              departed in 1617. But the three records are particular about the accommodation
              afforded by this intriguing ‘beare hole.’ In 1620–1 we have a payment for ‘a house
              lock for the beare hole &amp; key,’ in 1630–1 money is paid ‘for straw to laie in the
              beare hole,’ and in 1632 there are two payments, the first for ‘board<ex>es</ex>
              nayles &amp; workmanshippe of the hall ou<ex>er</ex> the Beare hole’ (which locates
              the beare hole, below the town hall), and the second ‘for hanginge the beare hole
              doore.’ Was this beare hole to provide accommodation for a travelling bear or bears,
              when they were in Stafford to perform? There are no payments for bearwards in the
              records, so one cannot be sure. However, a clue is afforded by a petition to the
              borough <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1140/" type="Collective_Occupation">mayor</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/19671/" type="Person_Commoner">Matthew
                Cradock</rs>, in 1614. A townsman, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/20377/" type="Person_Commoner">William
                Rycrofte</rs>, was granted permission to keep one bear, on condition that he hand
              over the bear to the mayor when required. Rycrofte appears a number of times in the

              the mayor obtained entertainment from bearbaitings, at his request, without reward
              (the ‘beare hole,’ providing accommodation, being the payment). At least this record
              allows us to locate one bear in Stafford from 1614, and probably explains the
              expenditure of borough funds to maintain the bear hole.</p>

            <p>Situated in the extreme north-west part of Staffordshire near the headwaters of the
              Trent, Newcastle under Lyme takes part of its name from Lyme Brook, one of the Trent
              tributaries, and partly from the new castle, built in the late eleventh or early
              twelfth century (why it was called ‘new’ is unknown). Newcastle provides an example of
              a borough that was well-organized and governed – it was called a ‘borough’ in a Pipe
              Roll in 1172–3, and received a charter in 1590 that established, to the end of our
              period and beyond, a mayor, two bailiffs, and twenty-four capital burgesses.<note type="foot"><title>VCH: Staffordshire</title>, vol 8, pp 1, 11–12, 25–6;

                1880), p 69.</note> This was a closed oligarchy controlling all aspects of the
              town’s life. Newcastle possesses a comprehensive documentary history; a series of
              minute books called the ‘Red Books,’ beginning in 1369 and continuing (except for
              1411–91) to the end of our period and beyond. Newcastle has very sparse records of
              entertainment activities, but the two orders that do survive show us a borough
              government extremely hostile to entertainments. Puritanism was evident in other
              council actions: ‘in 1628, for example, the council decreed that the church bells were
              not to be rung without the consent of the mayor or his deputy, except for prayers and
              burials, and that sparingly.’<note type="foot"><title>VCH: Staffordshire</title>, vol

              the remarkable collection of records of the annual <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/8709/" type="Entertainer_Type">minstrels</rs>’ court and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/37400/" type="Entertainment_AnimalSport">bull-running</rs> at Tutbury, that extend until
              1637. The earliest reference to minstrels at Tutbury comes from 1313–15, when an
              agreement concerning pasturage of minstrels’ horses was recorded (this was repeated in
              1558–9). Our first record of the minstrels’ court, from <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/13153/" type="Person_Royalty">John
                of Gaunt’s</rs> Register Book on 22 August 1380, does not establish a new minstrels’
              court but confirms an existing one, under the control of ‘n<ex>ost</ex>re bein ame le
              Roy des Ministralx,’ and requires allegiance from all minstrels. Then we suffer a long
              silence in the records, which led Richard Rastall to suggest that the court had become
              defunct by 1449, when an order by <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/44444/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Henry VI</rs> attempted to control minstrelsy throughout England, except <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/43568/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Chester</rs>, but not excepting the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/37242/" type="Place_BoroughParish">honour of Tutbury</rs> from its provisions. Rastall also speculates that the
              bull-running was an innovation in the fifteenth century, ‘[an] encouragement to
              minstrels to support a dying institution.’<note type="foot">Rastall, <title>Secular
                  Musicians</title>, pp 4–6.</note> Whether or not a lack of records is evidence of
              a cessation of the minstrels’ court is impossible to tell (pas de documents, pas
              d’histoire), but in any case we cannot trace the court in any detail until the
              seventeenth century. The next reference to the minstrels’ court is a description of
              the customs of the court at its annual meeting and election of new officers; the
              document dates from 1617–30 but its narrative is from a much earlier, and uncertain,
              date – it refers to the abbey of Tutbury and its <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/27258/" type="Collective_ClergyAndChurchwardens">prior</rs>, which means that it must
              predate the Dissolution of the monasteries. It does delineate the extent of the
              court’s powers, over musicians ‘within the king<ex>es</ex> M<ex>aies</ex>t<ex>ies</ex>

                  (<title>OEDO</title>, sv ‘honour,’ n, 6). As F.B. Stenton notes (<title>The First
                  Century of English Feudalism 1066–1166</title>, 2nd ed (Oxford, 1961), 55–9) an
                honour might, as did Tutbury Honour, extend through several counties (as listed here
                in the document), but the manors contained within an honour need not be adjoining –
                by no means the whole of, say, Warwickshire was within the honour of Tutbury, whose
                manors were mainly located within Staffordshire and Derbyshire. The honour of
                Tutbury was not coterminous with the duchy of Lancaster.</note> The description is
              prescriptive and ceremonial in nature; it suggests, for example, that fines are to be
              levied upon offenders but does not specify the nature of an offence or the mechanism
              by which such offences were to be discovered. Nor do we gain an idea of the numbers of
              minstrels involved.<note type="foot">Rastall, ‘Secular Musicians,’ pp 13–14, is
                apparently unaware of this 1617–30 description of the ceremonies of the court, or
                the orders of 1618 and 1630, but instead quotes from a much later description, from
                1680, preserved in Robert Plot, <title>The Natural History of Staffordshire</title>
                (Oxford, 1686), 437; this presents much less detail than the account here
                given.</note> (The writer is more interested in the details of the bull-running that
              followed the meeting of the court, about which more below, and the strange details
              about pasturage of the minstrels’ horses.) The next documents that shed light on the
              court are a set of orders made between 1618 and 1630 by the chancellor of the duchy of
              Lancaster. Their aim is to re-assert the king’s rights to the fines and other revenues
              from the court, and they detail the offences for which a minstrel might incur a
              penalty. They also afford protection to minstrels governed by the court, against
              competition from ‘foreign’ minstrels from outside the honour – hence the negative
              constraints on minstrels’ activities were counterpoised by this exclusive right to
              perform within the honour. The renewal and reiteration of these orders in 1630 are
              evidence of the Crown’s determination to receive income from this ancient minstrels'
              court of Tutbury.</p>
            <p>One yearns for some of the actual records of the workings on this minstrel court,
              showing the manner in which offences were discovered, offenders brought to hearings,
              and fines gathered. Similarly lacking is any idea of the size of this minstrel court,
              although a clue may be gathered from the ceremony of the bull-running. How many
              minstrels can chase a single bull through the crowded streets of medieval Tutbury?</p>
            <p>Let us turn next to the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/37400/" type="Entertainment_AnimalSport">bull-running</rs>, of which a full description is
              given by the early witness and recorded in 1617–30. One is perhaps reminded of modern
              Pamplona, Spain; however, there the bulls, fully intact, chase the runners rather
              than, as in Tutbury, having a single crazed and maddened bull being pursued by a mob.
              The gleeful enjoyment afforded by this (as it must seem to us) barbaric spectacle can
              only be imagined; however, in mitigation we must remember that most boroughs had
              bull-rings and in some, such as Shrewsbury, killing a bull without <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/21767/" type="Entertainment_AnimalSport">baiting</rs> it first with dogs was a punishable
              offence. (Apparently it was believed to tenderize the meat.) Tutbury’s bull, if
              captured by the minstrels (signified by the cutting off of part of one ear), was
              baited at the end of the day and then sold. The last records of the bull-running also
              afford us a view of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/24537/" type="Person_Royalty">Charles I</rs>, who interfered with the custom (moving it to
              another day) so it would not interfere with his activities (see ‘Royal Visits’

            <p>Walsall evolved after our period from a small borough with local industrial and
              market activity, chiefly in connection with horse transport, leather, and rope-making,
              into a thriving centre of the industrial revolution. By 1309 there had evolved some
              measure of local self-government, and in 1377 there were 367 persons who paid the
              poll-tax. Borough government evolved slowly, out of the divided jurisdiction of the
              manorial court and the borough, and such dates as the mayoral term of office (<rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/44523/" type="CalendarDay_Liturgical">Michaelmas</rs>–Michaelmas) and the date for rendering
              the annual accounts (23 November, established in 1501–2) were established by the
                manor.<note type="foot"><title>VCH: Staffordshire</title>, vol 17, pp 145,
                208–14.</note> A dispute over jurisdiction resulted in a Star Chamber case that
              gives us a glimpse into early borough government, and a local custom that was of long
              standing. In 1524–5 the lord of the king’s manor, Robert Acton, complained that some
              inhabitants of Walsall were flouting his authority, withholding fees due to him,
              cutting trees, hunting deer in his manor park, and other misdemeanours. They met his
              protests with a threat: ‘they would raise bayard of wallsall with his Thowsand colts.
              &amp; set &amp; appoint w<ex>i</ex>th the sayd bayard ^foure <del>for</del> hundred
              men to revenge their quarrells vpon him. And that they would ringe Bayards Bell….’ In
              the same complaint these items are explained: ‘because Bayard &amp; this Thowsand
              colts being great clubbs &amp; haue beene of long time set &amp; hanged vpp on highe
              in the Towne hall of Wallsall, &amp; there been<del>e</del> taken &amp; reputed in as
              much honor &amp; Worshipp as they were saincts in ye church; &amp; bee at certaine
              times in the yeare solempnly borne about the Towne in great reverence.’<note type="foot"><title>VCH: Staffordshire</title>, vol 17, p 214.</note> There cannot
              have been a thousand of these for a borough the size of Walsall at the time; one
              suspects a touch of hyperbole. The colts may be referred to in an entry in the borough
              accounts for 1629–30: ‘for gathering ye Clubbs at ye <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/43457/" type="Entertainment_Type">fayer</rs>,’ suggesting that they may have long been part of Walsall’s ceremonial
              life, whatever part they may have taken.</p>
            <p>The town grew slowly but steadily through our period. The other main settlement in
              the parish was at Bloxwich, a name suggesting a pre-Conquest origin.<note type="foot"><title>VCH: Staffordshire</title>, vol 17, p 161.</note> Most of the parish lay
              within Cannock Forest, a fact which influenced its early agrarian development.<note type="foot"><title>VCH: Staffordshire</title>, vol 17, p 180.</note> Industrial
              activity was in progress by the 14th century when there is evidence of mining and
              iron-working. <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/44556/" type="Person_Commoner">Leland</rs>
              <hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1540 described Walsall as a little market town with a park,

            <p>The mayors’ accounts are preserved beginning in 1594 and continue in a broken series
              to 1642. The earliest of the four payments to players is the largest (7s to the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/17474/" type="Collective_Troupe">queen’s players</rs> in 1611–12), and the last is found in 1624–5, hardly an
              avalanche of enthusiasm for travelling professional players. Possibly the infrequency
              of payments to travelling professionals is explained by Walsall’s physical position in
              an ‘out of the way’ part of Staffordshire, not served by good roads. A tradition of
              music on the fair days is found from 1629; although these records extend to 1641–2
              even here one encounters evidence of dividedness. In 1636–7 the mayor ‘gaue a fellowe
              to goe to <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/37589/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Dudley</rs> to warne ye Musitians they should not come to
              the fayer viij d.’ But in vain – the musicians came and were paid but only 2s (the
              lowest payment recorded). In 1639–40 the payment was at a normal level but the scribe
              made his opinion of such goings-on apparent, calling it ‘ye beggerly musicke at both
              ye fayres.’ Was this a critical comment on the quality of the music offered? Or was it
              simple opposition to music? A ‘tune may be religious,’ as Ben Jonson’s Puritan Ananias
              said, but maybe not.</p>

            Staffordshire between 1575 and 1637 have left us significant records: <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/3702/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Lichfield</rs> 1575 (<rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/11772/" type="Person_Royalty">Queen Elizabeth</rs>); <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1309/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Stafford</rs> 1575 (Queen Elizabeth) and 1617 (King James I); and Tutbury 1637 (King
            Charles). The records for these four visits vary greatly in type and completeness. From
            Lichfield we have an antiquarian copy of the contemporary bailiffs’ accounts (with some
            editorial guesswork by John Nichols in his <title>Progresses</title>).<note type="foot">Nichols, <title>Progresses</title>, vol 1, pp 529–32. Nichols gives details (pp
              417–599) about the queen’s entire progress in 1575.</note> From Stafford in 1575 we
            enjoy a narrated report without contemporary bailiffs’ accounts, and it is remarkable
            how the shape of the event is coloured by the selectivity of the narrator, who is
            unfamiliar with some important details such as the date, which is supplied by a later
            writer. Also it is unclear if the narration was written soon after the event or at a
            later time. From 1617 we enjoy both a lengthy and detailed narration along with a list
            of fees paid to the king’s servants.</p>
          <p>The queen’s visits to Lichfield and Stafford in 1575 formed part of an elaborate
            progress through the Midlands (in fact, the most northerly travel the monarch ever
            undertook). For our purposes it began at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/37937/" type="Place_F_Residence">Kenilworth Castle</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/2327/" type="Place_County">Warwickshire</rs>, where the princely pleasures, organized over a
            ten-day period by <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/44753/" type="Person_Nobility">Robert Dudley</rs>, earl of Leicester, were sumptuous and
            spectacular; the queen then proceeded north and west to enjoy more modest levels of
            entertainment. The charges recorded at Lichfield were for a visit of eight days, but the
            accounts do not give a narrative of the activities that took place. There also occurred,
            en route to Stafford, a stay (for which no records survive) of ten days at Chartley
            Manor, a manor also owned by the earl of Leicester (and which, interestingly, served as
            prison for <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/44850/" type="Person_Royalty">Mary</rs>, Queen of Scots in 1585–6). We do know that at some
            time before her visit to Stafford the queen’s itinerary was changed to eliminate a visit
            to Shrewsbury, for which its townspeople were feverishly preparing (the royal change of
            plans deprived the queen of the experience of a ‘Shewe’ devised by Thomas
              Churchyard).<note type="foot">J.A.B. Somerset (ed), <title>Shropshire</title>, vol 1,
              REED (Toronto, 1994), 220.</note></p>
          <p>The visit to Stafford was very brief and seemed consciously designed as an occasion to
            display royal munificence, without excessive trappings. While one might wonder why this
            occasion lacked the usual accoutrements of a royal entry (no mention of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1243/" type="Entertainer_Type">music</rs>, for example), this may have been an oversight on the part of the person
            who recorded the event. It is unthinkable that the monarch, making a royal entrance into
            a borough, would not have her arrival announced by a trumpet fanfare. We may compare
            1617 where the elaborate narrative of King James’s entry mentions <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1225/" type="Entertainer_Type">trumpets</rs> only twice, briefly. The main point about 1575 is that a royal entry is
            ipso facto a ‘staged’ event giving an occasion for the monarch to shine. Nowadays we
            might use the deck of an aircraft carrier or a frigate, or a factory floor, to accompany
            the delivery of a desired political message. Queen Elizabeth came to offer relief to a
            town in economic difficulties.</p>
          <p>The 1617 visit of King James to Stafford, for which the narration is richly detailed,
            is remarkable for the relatively minor part played by the monarch, in an action of civic
            strife, partisan rivalries, and local incompetence. The narrator refers several times to
            the town as ‘Israell,’ apparently to recall the twelve warring tribes. Unlike this
            narrative the financial accounts which survive give no hint of the rich comedy/drama
            that subsumed Stafford’s life for months before the event. The borough had achieved the
            grant of a new charter in 1614 that changed the town’s government greatly, bringing in a
            single mayor and restricting the franchise; the change had its supporters (including the
            writer of this narrative of the royal visit) and its detractors, whom the narrator calls
            ‘the vulgar sort’ and ‘flat caps.’ Since the writer is admittedly highly partisan (a
            class bias is evident), we have to filter the commentary carefully; however, examples
            multiply in which Stafford citizens refused to cooperate or actively undermined
            initiatives to prepare for the visit. Since we don’t have comparable ‘behind the scenes’
            accounts of preparations in other localities, we can only wonder if boroughs commonly
            sent representatives to witness ceremonies in other towns, to gain insights about what
            should be done. It is not unlikely that an inexperienced borough would thus seek insight
            so that their royal welcome would proceed smoothly and meet royal approval. Probably
            unique to Stafford, however, was the failure of the council’s attempts to witness events
            in <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/36860/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Preston</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/2057/" type="Place_County">Lancashire</rs> (on James’s journey north) because <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/19256/" type="Person_Commoner">Richard
              Dorington</rs> flatly refused to make the trip, and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/22359/" type="Person_Commoner">Francis
              Dorington</rs> demanded to have travelling expense money paid up front. Thwarted of
            his plan to gain experience of a royal welcome to this much larger centre, the mayor had
            to be content to send townsmen to <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/15590/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Nantwich</rs>, a smaller town approximately thirty miles north-west, in <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1805/" type="Place_County">Cheshire</rs>, to gather intelligence on the king’s return journey – which they
            gained from members of the royal entourage, who gave them detailed and valuable advice.
            Royal staff also preceded the monarch and conducted a ‘dress rehearsal’ in Stafford. The
            detailed work of preparation was aimed to ensure that everything would go off without a
            hitch and would, in fact, look spontaneous.</p>
          <p>Particularly amusing were the preparations for the town’s <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/41951/" type="Entertainment_Type">oration</rs> of welcome. The town’s recorder absolutely refused to prepare and
            deliver this oration (in effect, he replied that this was ‘not in my job description…’);
            this led to plots to replace the recorder, and the recruitment of a substitute speaker
            whose attempt at a speech was rejected when he presented it the day before the visit
            because, among other things, it was ‘a little too tedious.’ So the speech had to be
            re-written the night before, to <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/19579/" type="Person_Commoner">Thomas
              Worswicke’s</rs> specifications, containing the memorable opening line: ‘Most gracious
              sou<ex>er</ex>aigne vnto the great Comaunder of all king<ex>es</ex>, we bend the knees
            of o<ex>u</ex>r hart<ex>es</ex>….’</p>
          <p>And on the great day misfortunes continued to plague the visit, particularly a
            drenching rain that forced the king to wait, in his coach, under the north gateway arch,
            for three hours. The usual ceremonies of welcome were performed after the rain – the
            royal entrance mounted on horseback, the delivery and return of the mace, the tedious
            oration (delivered on bended knees), and the delivery of the town’s gift. Throughout it
            all King James said hardly a word; he received the town’s gift, for example, but said
            not a word of thanks. The king’s <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40619/" type="Entertainment_Type">procession</rs> out of town was cut short by another rainstorm, which forced the king
            to resume his coach under the town’s east gate, where he tendered his hand for the mayor
            to kiss. One’s impression is that the royal entry was not a success, partly because of
            the enmities in the town (which the narrator addresses once more, in his parting shot),
            and partly because of James’s reticence, bespeaking an unwillingness to participate.</p>
          <p>The final royal ‘visit’ to Tutbury in 1637 by King Charles is reflected only in a royal
            proclamation, forbidding any events in connection with the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/8709/" type="Entertainer_Type">minstrels’</rs> court and the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/37400/" type="Entertainment_AnimalSport">bull-running</rs> because of a planned royal visit to
            the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/37265/" type="Place_F_Residence">castle</rs>, and fear of the plague. This command,
            delivered less than a month before the events, cannot have been welcome. One’s
            impression is of a monarch refusing to greet his people, a far cry from the
            people-handling skills shown by Queen Elizabeth.</p>

          <div>
            <p>Stafford is not endowed with numerous households, perhaps because of its early
              situation with half of the county being royal forests, subject to forest law with all
              its limitations on permitted activities. As well, it was not a rich shire and (like
              Shropshire) it was distant enough to be out of the London orbit. One family, the <rs ref="eats:298178" type="Person_Family">Wrottesleys</rs> of <rs ref="eats:40181" type="Place_F_Residence">Wrottesley Hall</rs>, near <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/44947/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Tettenhall</rs>, suffered misfortune in 1897 when their hall burned to the ground,
              leading to the loss of all their records (except for those previously catalogued and
              described by the Historical Manuscripts Commission).<note type="foot">Historical
                Manuscripts Commission, <title>Guide to the Location of Collections Described in the
                  Reports and Calendars Series 1870-1980</title> (London, 1982), 68.</note> A number
              of aristocratic families owned properties in Staffordshire and, although no records
              survive for the residences in question, there is evidence from other county records of
              their entertainers on tour.<note type="foot">These residences include Bradwell and
                Keele, owned by Ralph Sneyd (1612–49/50); Chartley Manor, owned by the Devereux
                family; Lettice Knollys’ home at Drayton Basset; Dudley Castle, owned by John Dudley
                (1504–53), followed by Edward Sutton (1536–86) and his heir; Heleigh Castle, owned
                by John Tuchet (1425–90); Stafford Castle, owned by the Stafford family; Tutbury,
                home of George Plantagenet (1449–77/8) and later Henry Cavendish
              (1550–1616).</note></p>
            <p>The many-times married Lettice Knollys, countess of Essex and Leicester, resided
              during the 1560s at Chartley Manor, with her first husband Walter Devereux, and from
              1595 at her home, Drayton Basset, where she died in 1634. Her papers could not be
              located. Another notable noble with Staffordshire connections is John of Gaunt, duke
              of Lancaster, whose far-flung properties were legion. His register books, preserved in
              The National Archives, preserve many details of his activities. It is not really
              correct to depict him as ‘of Tutbury’ since he was a national and international
              military and political leader. We find him fairly constantly on the move within
              England, and between England and the continent (where his ambitions as king of Castile
              preoccupied him). Gaunt’s second wife, Constance of Castile, took up residence at
              Tutbury but Gaunt was not often there, and after his alliance with his mistress
              Katherine Swynford became open knowledge, Gaunt visited there no more.</p>

              1570, receiving a summons to parliament in 1571. He resided at the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40000/" type="Place_F_Residence">manor, Burton upon Trent</rs>, a house built by his <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/45067/" type="Person_Nobility">father</rs> after 1545, using building stone from the dissolved abbey and built
              within the abbey precincts. He also partly rebuilt <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/44969/" type="Place_F_Residence">Beaudesert</rs> House between 1573 and 1583, where he latterly lived part of the
              time. Beaudesert was on the southern edge of Cannock forest, approximately 12 miles
              south of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1309/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Stafford</rs>. It has been largely demolished in 1935,
              although some ruins remain including the south wall of the great hall. The records of
              the household illuminate family entertainment activities from 1579–81, but it is
              difficult to locate the venues for these entertainments as either Burton Manor or
              Beaudesert. A guest at meals (dinner and/or supper) named in the accounts between 2

              in any case they were being fed rather than rewarded for performing. By 1580 Paget's

              uncovered in 1583 Paget fled abroad.</p>

Much of the detail of the case is not relevant and is not
              transcribed here. According to Thomas’ response, between January and June, 1635,
              Elizabeth was in great suspicion of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/45689/" type="CrimesMisdemeanors">adultery</rs> with one <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/5899/" type="Person_Commoner">Thomas Wilding</rs> of the parish of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/36419/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Coppenhall</rs>, and the couple were presented diverse times by the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/3576/" type="Collective_ClergyAndChurchwardens">churchwardens</rs> of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/15590/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Nantwich</rs> for incontinency. Thomas Dikes and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/20593/" type="Person_Commoner">Randle Meakin</rs>, godfather of Elizabeth, persuaded her to promise to avoid
              Wilding’s company, and Dikes likewise persuaded Wilding to avoid her house. But all to
              no avail, because the incident here related took place, apparently in June 1635. Dikes
              was careful to correct his place of residence to Nantwich, not <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/36442/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Middlewich</rs>.</p>

            <p>This is the earliest extract from these records concerning <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/8942/" type="Person_Commoner">Thomas Jacson</rs>, but not his earliest or only appearance therein. A brief digest
              will summarize his amazing fortunes with the quarter sessions. His name first appears
              in 1583, and in three other writs before 1589 he was ordered to appear at the sessions
              to answer touching various offences. He apparently moved to <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/3612/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Eccleshall</rs> sometime between April 1587 and November 1589. He was fined for
              assault at the Epiphany sessions in 1592/3, and at the Trinity sessions of 1597 he was
              noted as being a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/21077/" type="Collective_Occupation">victualler</rs> of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/3612/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Eccleshall</rs>. Following the present complaints, Jacson was named at the Easter
              sessions in 1601, in a petition from <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/9022/" type="Person_Clergy">Roger
                Steventon</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/9186/" type="Collective_ClergyAndChurchwardens">vicar</rs>, who asked to have an earlier
              action resumed against Jacson. At the same sessions a petition was entered against
              Jacson containing seven charges, some of which duplicate charges were made in the
              present document. At the Trinity sessions in 1601 it was noted that Jacson had again
              broken recognizances. The next information about him is extracted in the three
              following records, from the Easter 1604 and Epiphany 1604–5 session. Between these, at
              the Trinity 1604 sessions, Jacson was required to post recognizances; he was also
              summoned to post sureties to keep the peace at the Epiphany 1605/6 sessions and
              (twice) at the Trinity 1606 sessions – on all three occasions he was noted as 'not
              found.'</p>
            <p> There are striking similarities in the allegations against Jacson between the
              various petitions, complaints, and informations, and hence it is difficult to attach
              precise dates to the offenses. We cannot ascertain if Jacson was a repeat offender
              (although it seems unlikely that he would replicate his actions so exactly over a
              period of several years). More likely is that Jacson was a scofflaw, against whom
              complainants repeatedly filed their complaints in hopes of causing effective action
              against Jacson. The list of appearances, and the likelihood that the complainants were
              constrained to press their charges again and again, provides ample evidence that the
              quarter sessions was not totally efficient as an instrument of local justice.
              Appearances were delayed from sessions to sessions if a defendant was 'not found' or
              was absent on other business. Presumably the complaints and action against Thomas
              Jacson extended over more several years because the defendant, apparently being
              somewhat rebarbative, was not amenable to correction. To round off the story of Thomas
              Jacson, one is amazed to find that at the Epiphany sessions of 1608–9, item 23,
              details are given about two horse thieves who were examined at the sessions by Bishop
                <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/17083/" type="Person_Clergy">Overton</rs> and held over for the assizes. En route to <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1309/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Stafford</rs> gaol, the constable of Eccleshall chose to detain his prisoners
              temporarily in the house of Thomas Jacson! However this came about, it is apparent
              that by 1608 Jacson had somehow made his peace with the complainants (including the
              bishop) whose names appear on this series of complaints.</p>

              to sell ale, but continued to do so without a licence. The charges differ considerably
              between lists. This list of nine charges comprises allegations that Jacson: broke into

              internal date. It contains eight charges, all but one of which appear to relate to
              offences against the church or church property: Jacson allegedly led a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/45576/" type="CrimesMisdemeanors">riotous affray</rs> in the churchyard, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/45465/" type="CrimesMisdemeanors">beating</rs> the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/9186/" type="Collective_ClergyAndChurchwardens">vicar</rs>'s people; <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/45540/" type="CrimesMisdemeanors">reviled</rs> the vicar on another occasion; <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/45558/" type="CrimesMisdemeanors">broke</rs> down the gate into the churchyard; hired soldiers to destroy the grass

              along with others. This last charge may have led the <rs ref="eats:294848" type="Collective_Clergy">bishop</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/17083/" type="Person_Clergy">William Overton</rs>, to write to the justices of peace against 'one Thomas
              Iackson.' His letter is a single sheet, dated 15 December 1604 from <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/41207/" type="Place_F_Residence">Eccleshall Castle</rs>, and is preserved amongst the papers from the Epiphany
              1604/5 sessions (Nos 67-8). With apparent exasperation, the bishop alleges that Jacson
              '...is now become suche an intollerable malefactor, and continuall offendor, in worde,
              and deede, that no honest man can well abide him. And therfore yt may please you to

              can bee served in the Churche, nor the Towne, where he dwelleth bee in any
              quietnes....' Perhaps, however, the bishop's letter of corroboration was intended to
              accompany <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/9022/" type="Person_Clergy">Roger Steventon</rs>'s letter of complaint.</p>

            <p>This undated letter of complaint, signed by <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/9022/" type="Person_Clergy">Roger
                Steventon</rs>, is preserved along with <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/17083/" type="Person_Clergy">Bishop Overton</rs>'s letter in the papers from the Epiphany 1604/5 sessions. It is
              quite similar to the preceding list of complaints (Easter sessions, No 63), since
              Steventon presumably limited himself here to alleged offences committed against him
              personally. <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/8942/" type="Person_Commoner">Jacson</rs>, he claims: <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/45540/" type="CrimesMisdemeanors">mocked</rs> him in church three days together; <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/45465/" type="CrimesMisdemeanors">fought</rs> in the churchyard; scoffed at the vicar's sermons; [extract printed in
              text]; <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/45652/" type="CrimesMisdemeanors">forced an entry</rs> into the churchyard; mocked the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/9186/" type="Collective_ClergyAndChurchwardens">vicar</rs> in the street, daring him to
              show himself; <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/45521/" type="CrimesMisdemeanors">defamed</rs> the vicar's wife ; and defamed the vicar in
              the churchyard, with clamorous speeches.</p>

            <p>The original manuscript from which Nichols drew his transcriptions is untraceable.
              The latest edition of Nichols, John Nichols’s <hi rend="italic">The Progresses</hi>,
              vol 2, pp 332–4, adds nothing, and elides entries to produce only a partial set of
              records – this is why this transcription is taken from the original edition of
              Nichols, which purports to present a more complete document. In the absence of early
                <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/3702/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Lichfield</rs> civic records, it is impossible to
              identify these local officials further. For further information on the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/11772/" type="Person_Royalty">queen</rs>’s progress from <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/36077/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Kenilworth</rs> through Lichfield, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/36533/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Chartley</rs>, and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1309/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Stafford</rs>, see the Introduction. The 'Other Extracts
              for the "Charges Extraordinary" of the year' are given as in Nichols, because he
              assumed them to be associated with the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40648/" type="Entertainment_Type">royal progress</rs> (<hi rend="italic">Progresses</hi>, vol 2, p 334). Nichols does
              not present any narrative record of the queen’s visit to Lichfield.</p>

            <p>This list of complaints contains nine numbered allegations, each followed by a
              separate list of witnesses. All the witnesses' names are in the scribal hand except
              for that of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/14182/" type="Person_Clergy">John Deane</rs>, the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/9186/" type="Collective_ClergyAndChurchwardens">curate</rs>, who signed his own name to the
              allegations involving him.

              allegations are that Greene: was a picker of quarrels, a maintainer of diverse actions
              and suits, and a haunter of alehouses; was a taker of bribes; was a buyer of actions
              and debts; had offered bribes to subvert the course of justice; had forced others to
              spend overmuch time and money defending suits and actions launched by Greene; [extract
              printed in text of two charges]; had boasted how his litigiousness aided him to sleep
              and eat better; and was a sower of debates and discord. Greene's claim to be <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/9186/" type="Collective_ClergyAndChurchwardens">parson</rs> of the parish of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/3774/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Norton</rs> seems highly unlikely.</p>

            <p>The rendering date given on f 134, 20 February 1623/4, is presumably an error because
              it fell on a Saturday. 19 February was the Friday following Quadragesima, the normal
              day for presentation of the accounts.</p>
            <p><rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/23345/" type="Person_Commoner">Thomas Swinnerton</rs>'s name is given here with the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/24519/" type="Collective_Troupe">prince’s players</rs>, but he is named in 1627–8 as a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/25345/" type="Collective_Troupe">king's man</rs> and in December 1629 with <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/8782/" type="Entertainer_Type">unspecified players</rs>.</p>
            <p><rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/24813/" type="Person_Commoner">Martin Slater</rs> was an <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/25827/" type="Collective_Troupe">admiral's man</rs> from 1594–7, and was last recorded in <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/36947/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">London</rs> as manager of the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/25046/" type="Collective_Troupe">King's Revels</rs> in 1608; after that he appears in the provinces as master of the
                <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/24866/" type="Collective_Troupe">Queen's
              children of Bristol</rs> in 1618–9. Here he appears as leader of an unnamed troupe.
              It is not unlikely that he returned to London before his death; one Martin Slawter,
              servant, appears in the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/36966/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Southwark</rs> token books from 1595 to 1602, and was
              buried in Southwark on 4 August 1625 (See E.K. Chambers, <title>Elizabethan
                Stage</title>, vol 2 (Oxford, 1923), 340).</p>
            <p><rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/24474/" type="Person_Commoner">Nicholas Hanson</rs> is unidentified, but possibly he was appearing with Slater in
              connection with the children of Bristol. In the mayor’s accounts 1627–8 he was
              rewarded in December 1627 as leader of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/17835/" type="Collective_Troupe">Lord Dudley’s players</rs>.</p>
            <p>The ‘Chamber of Bristoll’ was a children’s company established in 1615 under the
              patronage of Queen Anne; it appears from a complaint that by 1619 the company included
              a number of adults as well as children. They are not found in London (see Chambers,
              Elizabethan Stage, vol 2, p 69).</p>
            <p>Another copy of these accounts appears in Thomas Worswicke's Book, f 175v.</p>

            <p>The document containing this antiquarian description of the bull-running at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1044/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Tutbury</rs> can be dated to the early years of the seventeenth century, but the
              original account itself is of an indeterminate but likely much earlier date. The MS of
              which it forms a part was styled a 'trewe copie of the antient franchisses priviledges
              and customs,' indicating its antiquarian intention. By the seventeenth century there
              was no abbey gate from which to begin the bull-running, and there was no <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/27258/" type="Collective_ClergyAndChurchwardens">prior</rs> whose right to the bull (if it
              escaped capture) is here asserted. There are some other puzzles which indicate that
              the writer of the document was not an eyewitness, and did not completely understand
              the workings of the minstrels' court. For example, the procession to the church, and
              hence to the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/37288/" type="Place_F_TownHall">moot hall</rs>, is led among others by a single steward, but
              four such officers are to be elected by the company; when the four have been charged
              with their authority the jury leaves the court, leaving 'the Steward' and his
              assistants in their places. Following this, 'booth' Stewards are mentioned, but below
              this two of the stewards are alluded to. Some of this confusion stems from the
              writers' failure to distinguish between the king's high steward or lieutenant of the
                <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/37242/" type="Place_BoroughParish">honour of Tutbury</rs> and the four stewards of the
              minstrels' court. Turning to the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/37400/" type="Entertainment_AnimalSport">bull-running</rs>, one wonders how, if the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/8709/" type="Entertainer_Type">minstrels</rs> are completely unarmed, those who capture the bull are supposed to
              claim victory by cutting off some piece of his ear? Biting seems a bit needlessly
              cruel, as well as unhygenic and possibly dangerous.</p>

            <p>It is difficult to determine the underlying issues in this complex case, but one can
              suggest a reason why it was brought before Star Chamber. The complainant, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/27498/" type="Person_Commoner">Anthony Kynnersley</rs>, a justice of peace and quorum, alleges that the
              defendants, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/27543/" type="Person_Commoner">William Tyxall</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/27588/" type="Person_Commoner">Godfrey Tyxall</rs> his brother, and ten or more other unknown persons, had
              committed a series of offences against him, including several felonies such as <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/45558/" type="CrimesMisdemeanors">tearing down</rs> the complainant's house and barn, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/45614/" type="CrimesMisdemeanors">stealing</rs> three loads of hay, stealing three wagon loads of winter corn, and
              poaching his deer. One may wonder why Kynnersley did not have the malefactors dealt
              with by the quarter sessions and the assizes? Presumably he must have felt that local
              grand and petty juries could not be depended upon to judge the case impartially,
              either because of prejudice against himself or as a result of bribery or threats. The
                <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/45521/" type="CrimesMisdemeanors">libel</rs> (of which we have presumably only got the title
              or opening lines) gave Kynnersley the option of making a 'star chamber matter of the
              case, although it appears to be the least of his complaints. This explains why
              Kynnersley, having swallowed the camel of these various felonies, here goes to Star
              Chamber to strain at an apparent gnat (his final charge, the libellous rhyme quoted in
              the bill). <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/27637/" type="Person_Commoner">John Everett</rs> is mentioned in the bill only in connection
              with the complaint about poaching and the libel, so probably he was implicated only in
              those offences. In the only surviving answer to the bill, Godfrey Tyxall alleges that
              malice between Kynnersley and his brother had existed for three or four years because
              of a dispute over a piece of land (implying that matters ran more deeply between them
              than the bill of complaint states). Beyond this, Godfrey Tyxall merely denied any
              guilt, and his response adds nothing to the facts alleged in the bill of
              complaint.</p>

Court
              information is taken from the acta paragraph on p 1; another acta paragraph occurs on
              p 12b, but this was a loose paper before the rebinding and repair of the volume, and
              it may well not be correctly placed. It gives the date as 25 August and the place of
              proceedings as the home of the chancellor, in the presence of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/28820/" type="Person_Commoner">Simon Martin</rs>, notary public. The phrase 'vt sup<ex>r</ex>a' presumably refers
              to the previous (unrelated) case, in which the defendant is ordered to make public
              confession in his own parish church on the following Sunday and to make a copy of the
              schedule of penance. Although not specifically mentioned, the need to certify
              compliance is implied by mention of the copy of the schedule, because such
              certificates were normally written on the dorse of the copy. </p>

              <ab>This indenture made between John, king, etc, of the one part and John de
                Buckingham, clarioner of the other part, witnesses that the said John is kept and
                retained before the said king and duke for peace and for war for the term of his
                life in the following manner, that is to say, that the said John will be retained to
                serve the said king and duke as clarioner for the term of his life both in times of
                peace and of war and to work with him in such regions as are pleasing to the said
                king and duke, well and fittingly arrayed as a man of arms for the war. And in times
                of peace, that is to say, at the four great feasts of the year and also when he is
                summoned by letters of the same king and duke, the said John shall have an allowance
                for food and will take 7 1/2d per day for his wages in the court for himself, his
                people, and horses. And the said John shall begin the table of the minstrels (of)
                the said king and duke and he shall take also in times of peace 12d a day for his
                wages when he is away from court on the business of the said king and duke and of
                their command. And the said John will take for his fee in times of peace 100s per
                year for the term of his life by the hands of the receiver general of that same king
                and duke who for the time will be at the terms of Easter and St Michael by equal
                portions. And in times of war the said John will take for his fee £10 per year and
                such wages for the war as others of his condition shall take, by the hands of the
                treasurer of the said king and duke for the war who for the time will be and
                regarding prisoners and other profits of war by him or any of his people taken or
                won together with the shipping for him, his people, horses, and others, their
                harnesses, the king and duke will treat him as he will treat others of his
                condition. In witness, etc. Given, etc.</ab>

                much loved Rollekyn, Petreken, Henry, and Hankyn our minstrels their annuities

                officers within your receipt their fees and wages due and customary to them and in
                the manner as you are accustomed in time past – our other letters recently sent to
                you to the contrary notwithstanding – receiving from you letters of acquittances
                under the seals of the said Rollekyn, Petrekyn, Henry, and Hankyn witnessing the
                payments which you have thus made to them. By which letters and by this one we wish
                that you have due allowance in your account. And in addition to this we command that
                you bring in your hand or send to us at our castle in Kenilworth the remaining
                monies of your receipt in order to deliver it there to our receiver general. And do
                not overlook this. Given, etc, at our castle of Kenilworth, 6 November in the third

          <p>The Ashmolean manuscripts were among the rarities bequeathed to the University of
            Oxford by Elias Ashmole, antiquary, at his death in 1692. They formed the basis of the
            Ashmolean Museum. In 1860 the manuscripts were transferred to the Bodleian Library.</p>
          <p>The volume in which this remarkable <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40706/" type="Entertainment_Type">ballad</rs> occurs, Ashmole 48, is placed apparently randomly among the collection of
            Ashmolean manuscripts. Black’s <title>Catalogue</title>, pp 83–90, preserves gaps in the
            numerical sequence of manuscripts, indicating that the numbering of items preceded the
            catalogue, and may have been by Elias Ashmole himself. Ashmole 48 is titled ‘A
            Collection of miscellaneous pieces of old English Minstrelsy’ and contains eighty-two
            items (the actual number of items does not correspond to the numbering system; not all
            are ballads – consider, for example, no. 69, ‘A circular table called “Spera furti,”
            with a rule to discover theft,’ which might provide a stronger example of the full
            diversity of the contents), some of them anonymous and others ascribed to various
            writers including Richard Sheale. The contents are remarkably diverse, reminding one of
            the pack of ballads brought by Autolycus and sold at the sheep-shearing feast in The
            Winter’s Tale (William Shakespeare, <title>The Winter’s Tale</title>, Stephen Orgel (ed)
            (Oxford, 1996), 4.3.257–89). We find, for example, current scandals retold, as in no.
            19, which describes ‘the murder of Lewes and Edmond West, two gentlemen of Aitton….’
            There is plentiful misogyny conveyed by, for examples, ‘On the vices of women’ (no. 26)
            and ‘Advice to a cuckold’ (no. 76). And there are other examples of the ballad of
            lament, such as ‘A clown consoling himself on his mistress becoming the vicar’s wife’
            (no. 77), which would seem to strike the same mournful note as ‘o god what a world.’</p>
          <p>Richard Sheale’s ballad/lament is included here because many of its details are
            corroborated by other evidence recently unearthed. Andrew Taylor’s comprehensive study,
              <title>The Songs and Travels of a Tudor Minstrel: Richard Sheale of Tamworth</title>
            (2012), shows that Sheale was, as he claims, working under <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/45283/" type="Person_Nobility">Stanley</rs> patronage as a minstrel. In many of its details, the story related by
            Sheale seems to be completely implausible. Chiefly, the actual value, in modern terms,
            of the sum of money that Sheale claims to have been carrying (£60) seems a figment of
            wildest fantasy – in terms of purchasing power for an average family in 2015 this sum is
            equal to £21,400, and in terms of its equivalency in wage rates, £247,800 (These
            comparative values are taken from, ‘Five Ways to Compute the Relative Value of a UK
            Pound Amount, 1270 to Present,’ MeasuringWorth.com (accessed 29 May 2016,
            https://www.measuringworth.com/ukcompare)). It seems utterly incredible that Sheale
            would possess such a sum, and that he would carry it in gold, on his person, unattended,
            while travelling on horseback from Tamworth to <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/36947/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">London</rs>. (Usually such large sums would be conveyed by letter-of-credit, the
            ancestor of the cheque.) Yet such an amount is claimed by Sheale, who interestingly goes
            into considerable detail over how he came to have such a sum (some of it being his
            wife’s earnings), defending himself against the charge of lying, of making the whole
            story up. Sheale claims that the thieves had privy notice of his departure from
            Tamworth, and lay in wait for him on <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/45410/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Dunsmore</rs> Heath, a ten-hour ride from Tamworth. Again, this seems implausible –
            why did the four thieves not strike sooner? And, having committed this capital crime,
            why did they let the victim escape? One would hang for armed <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/45614/" type="CrimesMisdemeanors">robbery</rs> as easily as for murder.</p>
          <p>It all makes a good fantastic story, and we see that this is the point when Sheale
            begins the main part of his lament, his pitch for generosity from his listeners. He
            relates how some neighbours helped him with barley to brew <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40997/" type="Thing_FoodDrink">drink</rs> for a church <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40561/" type="Entertainment_Type">ale</rs>, and it is likely that Sheale used the occasion of
            this ale, as well as other occasions, to sing this ballad as a request for donations
            from his audiences. Indeed, the ballad would have little point if it were not to be sung
            to audiences for this purpose of exciting charity amongst listeners, as it claims at the
            conclusion: 'Desyryng youe all to bear this tayle In mynde/ that I among your pursis
            nowe su<ex>m</ex> frendshipe may fynd/ eu<ex>er</ex>y man a lyttell wold satisfye my
            nede/ to helpe a posor man owt of dett it ys a gracious dede.'</p>
          <p>The text of the ballad is undated; it is in a hand of the mid-sixteenth century. The
            number that precedes the poem is clearly later than the seventeenth century; the title
            is probably written by a second contemporary hand, rather than the hand of the text. In
            Brydges and Haslewood, <title>British Bibliographer</title>, pp 99–100, 104–5, an
            anonymous correspondent, 'C,' discusses this manuscript and conjecturally dates one of
            Sheale's poems to 1558/9 (pp 97–8). We have therefore dated this poem <hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1550, on the assumption that Sheale flourished in this period.</p>
