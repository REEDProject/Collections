        <p>Records of Early English Drama (REED) is an international scholarly project that is
          establishing for the first time the context from which the drama of Shakespeare and his
          contemporaries grew. Founded in 1976, REED has worked since then to locate, transcribe,
          and edit historical documents containing evidence of drama, secular music, and other
          communal entertainment and ceremony from the Middle Ages until 1642, when the Puritans
          closed the London theatres.</p>

          <p>This collection of Rose Playhouse records is the first digital edition of London area
            Renaissance and Jacobean playhouses for the <title>REED Online</title> series. As
            editor, I have delighted in the support and expertise of several members of the REED
            editorial team. Tanya Hagen, REED's bibliographer and now managing editor, has been an
            invaluable companion along the way, first as our research paths converged while she
            edited the Rose bibliographic data for the <title>Early Modern London Theatres</title>
            website and lately as bibliographic support for and production manager of the completed
            collection. Tanya has also contributed the modernizations of the Records text, in
            response to our external readers' recommendations. I am also grateful to REED's
            associate editor and paleographer, Patrick Gregory, who checked all transcriptions and
            contributed the English glossary entries; and to our research associate, Illya Nokhrin,
            who assisted in content checking the editorial apparatus, indexed the collection and
            made a significant contribution to mapping all locations named with related events for
            the new timeline feature. Stephanie Hovland, my co-editor for the forthcoming Bear
            Gardens/Hope edition, also assisted in on-site work at an earlier stage of research.</p>

          <p>My long-time collaborator, Byron Moldofsky, deserves special mention for his
            cartographic skills and ongoing interest in developing a more ambitious project to map
            not only the Southwark area in historic detail but also the wider London area for more
            playhouse editions to come. It was his initiative to develop the timeline feature for
            the Rose, in collaboration with Dave Luxton, our web designer, Rory McClenagan, web
            programmer, and Illya Nokhrin. It has been a real pleasure to work with all members of
            this creative team.</p>

          <p>The <title>Rose Playhouse</title> collection, like other REED digital editions, would
            not appear on our screens without the expertise and advice of our programmer, Jamie
            Norrish, who has incorporated manuscript images to complement transcriptions for the
            first time, as well as the enhanced mapping and timeline.</p>

          <p>The inclusion of manuscript digital images has been made possible through friendly
            permissions granted by the following archives: The National Archives, The British
            Library, and the London Metropolitan Archives (City of London). My thanks to Paul
            Johnson (TNA), and Laurence Ward and Wendy Hawke (LMA), for responding to my requests
            for help with permission to publish transcriptions. I am grateful to the Trust for
            London for the 1650 lease of the Little Rose Estate, and to Justine Horseman Sewell and
            Southwark Cathedral for permission to include images from the St Saviour's Vestry
            Minutes now held at LMA. My special thanks go to Calista Lucy, Keeper of the Archives at
            Dulwich College, and to Grace Ioppolo, Director of the <title>Henslowe-Alleyn
              Digitisation Project</title>, who granted permission to link my transcriptions to the
            professional images on the open access <title>Henslowe-Alleyn</title> website.</p>

          <p>My visits to Dulwich College for work on the wonderful archive collection there were
            made memorable by Calista's hospitality, and I look forward to continuing collaboration
            with Grace, whose support for both the Rose and the Bear Gardens/Hope Playhouse edition
            has been warmly appreciated.</p>

          <p>On a personal note, I have treasured the friendship and shared interests of William
            Ingram and Alan Nelson, whose generous work on the parish records of St Saviour's
            Southwark made freely available on the web has assisted my own in many ways. It is a
            great pleasure that Bill has willingly shared his transcriptions and modernizations of
            early records of the Little Rose estate for inclusion as Appendix 1 in this
            collection.</p>

          <p>Finally, this publication has been made possible by three grants from the Social
            Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada. The first funded the initial
            research phase for the Rose and four other playhouses south of the river, and a
            Connection grant enabled most editorial staff work for the initial version, the
              <title>Rose Playhouse Prototype</title> published in 2020. Most recently, a second
            SSHRC Insight grant has supported editorial staff work for this full <title>Rose
              Playhouse</title> edition.</p>

          <p>The <rs ref="eats:231694" type="Place_F_Property">property known as the Rose</rs> was

            only crossing of the river to link the city of London and lands south and southeast of
            the river from Roman times until the eighteenth century, so its presence there was key
            to the development of Southwark as a zone of hospitality for travellers, notably
            Chaucer's pilgrims to Canterbury.<note type="foot">See further Martha Carlin,

            fields, meadows, and pastures. At the northeast corner of the estate, the bishop and his
            successors built a palace to serve as their London area residence: the great hall's west
            end wall with the stone tracery of its fine rose window remains standing on the south
            side of modern Clink Street as a silent witness to the former grandeur of the episcopal

          <p>The property called the Rose stretched from Bankside to Maid Lane and was owned by
            <rs ref="eats:199129" type="Person_Commoner">William Spence</rs>, a <rs ref="eats:127051" type="Collective_Occupations">fishmonger</rs> of London, in the early years of the sixteenth
              century.<note type="foot">In June 1537 Spence, then of Great Palgrave, Norfolk, but
              previously citizen and stockfishmonger of London, sold the Great Rose to Henry
              Polsted; for the deed, see TNA: E 326/12364.</note> By this time the <rs ref="eats:231675" type="Place_F_Property">Little Rose</rs> had
            been segregated from the 'Great Rose,' so its subsequent history evolves under different
            ownership. However, the deed drawn up for Spence's sale of the Great Rose names a <rs
              ref="eats:126979" type="Person_Commoner">Ralph Symonds</rs> as owner of the property
            just east of the Great Rose. This refers to the smaller section of the Little Rose which
            fronted on the Thames; the larger section of the property extended from behind the
            Hartshorn Inn to Maid Lane.<note type="foot">See the map and Carlin, 'Urban

                III–1912</title>, vol 2 (London, 1908), 26.</note> By 1552 she determined to make a
            charitable bequest of the Little Rose property in perpetuity following her death. Income
            from its rents would contribute to support of the poor from her parish, <rs
              ref="eats:225746" type="Place_PA_Settlement">St Mildred’s Bread Street</rs> London,
            and from Christ's Hospital, as well as needy fishermen in Old Fish Street. The deed,
            dated 3 December 1552, names as trustees or feoffees two gentlemen from Kent as well as
            sixteen others, very likely from St Mildred's parish. From Thomasyn's death in 1555
            onward, the trust seems to have been managed by representatives from the parish. The
            description of the estate in the deed indicates that some urban development had
            occurred: 'all that my mesuage or ten<ex>emen</ex>t called the little Roose with two

              17 September 1551 but not probated until 8 May 1555 (see TNA: PROB 11/37/319,
              transcribed by William Ingram in <ptr target="#rosep-ridm121523464"/>).</note> The
            mention of 'pond<ex>es</ex>' suggests that, like the neighbouring pike gardens to the
            west, the Little Rose still had some fishponds at the time. The marshy land along
            Bankside had been used in recent centuries for breeding freshwater fish, especially
            pike, in ponds maintained by London fishmongers like Ralph Symonds. </p>
          <p>On 20 November 1574 six of eight named parishioners of St Mildred's Bread Street signed
            a thirty-one year lease for the Little Rose 'messuage or Tenement' with <rs

            annual rent of £7 would be due in quarterly instalments, with Griffen (or his

            based on a finer copperplate map produced <hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1560, of which only
            three sections remain extant for comparison.<note type="foot">For a full digital

              Publication 159 (London, 2001).</note> Sadly, none show Southwark. The Agas version of
            the south bank to the east of Lambeth Marsh depicts the string of houses along the edge
            of the river, labelled ‘The Banck,’ with gardens stretching behind. Just a sampling of
            the more extensive fish ponds, or 'pike gardens,' south of the bank is represented and
            there are no theatres in view, a sure clue that the Agas map was based on an earlier,
            pre-1576 version of London. By the mid-sixteenth century, however, there is documentary
            evidence to support the existence of <rs ref="eats:21767" type="Entertainment_AnimalSport">bearbaiting</rs> arenas in Southwark and these are
            suggested in the two circular arenas just south of the bank, one titled 'The bolle
            bayting' and the other, to the east, 'The Bearebayting.' We should assume considerable
            artistic licence here. The precise locations of the arenas remain in question, but the
            views available suggest that when Withens took over the lease, the Little Rose estate
            consisted of very few buildings along the river with two as yet undeveloped 'gardens'
            stretching behind.</p>

          <p>The next document of interest relating to the Little Rose has deeper significance for
            the history of London theatre. On 10 January 1586/7 Henslowe signed a deed of
            partnership with a London grocer, <rs ref="eats:130879" type="Person_Commoner">John
              Cholmley</rs>.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#rosep-ridm90584488"/>.</note> Their

              playhouse</rs> to be built in Southwark, on the Little Rose property recently leased
            by Henslowe. The basic dimensions of the property are described as approximately
            ninety-four feet square. By the time the deed was being drawn up, the playhouse was 'now
            in framinge and shortly to be ereckted.' It seems likely that Henslowe, an entrepreneur
            just beginning to make his mark in Southwark, conceived of the plan and made a start to
            raise a playhouse, with the help of <rs ref="eats:131126" type="Person_Commoner">John

            Maid Lane that already had a tenant, whether resident or not.<note type="foot">The Token
              Books surviving sporadically between 1571 and 1588 do not list a John Cholmley (or
              variant surname) as a Southwark resident.</note> Although the terms of the sub-lease
            for this tenement have not been discovered, the deed of partnership makes clear that
            John Cholmley was the tenant and therefore an agreement of some sort with him would
            probably have been required in order to build the playhouse adjacent on the garden plot. </p>
          <p>The partnership agreed to between Henslowe and his tenant Cholmley was potentially
            profitable for both. As Bowsher and Cerasano summarize the terms, 'Cholmley was to pay
            Henslowe £816 in instalments over the course of eight and a quarter years but not
            starting until 25 June [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>, for 24 June], the feast day of St
            John the Baptist. This clearly shows that Henslowe had enough ready money to finance the
            bulk of construction costs himself. In return, Cholmley would receive a half-share in
            the profits of the plays, and have exclusive right to the catering and victualling of
            the enterprise run from his house. Moreover, both men would be allowed to admit their
            friends to performances without charging admission fees. Henslowe would finance the
            construction of the playhouse and pay all rents as of 29 September 1587, suggesting that
            this was the target date for the Rose’s opening. According to the deed, although
            Cholmley and Henslowe would share maintenance expenses of the playhouse thereafter and
            throughout the period covered by the agreement, Henslowe appears to have financed all of
            the major expenses before the playhouse was operable.'<note type="foot"> Julian Bowsher

          <p>The partnership would expire on Lady Day, 25 March 1595, but after the agreement early
            in 1587 Cholmley virtually disappears from the record. The only other mentions of
            Cholmley amongst the Henslowe-Alleyn papers after 1587 are a couple of scribbles,
            perhaps pen trials, on f 1 of Henslowe’s diary. William Ingram has persuasively
            identified this shadowy character as John Cholmley, originally from Bletchingley,
            Surrey, where he began his career as a tanner, following his father's trade, before
            achieving the freedom of the city as a member of the Grocers' company.<note type="foot"

            April 1589, so Henslowe would have assumed the profits from the joint enterprise
            thenceforth, according to the terms of the partnership agreement.<note type="foot"

                There is no reason to identify him with the king’s player, Thomas Pope, who died in

          <p>The lease of the Little Rose was soon to come due for renewal in 1605 but the new terms
            increasing the annual rent to £20, with a further 100 marks (equivalent to almost £66)
            required for building repairs, were obviously unappealing. It seems most likely that
            Henslowe followed through on his threat to abandon the playhouse. Closure of the
            theatres during the plague year of 1603 and subsequently for periods during 1604 and
            1605 may have further contributed to his decision.<note type="foot">See further F.P.

            playhouse. On 14 December 1604 he had claimed that he 'hath not any lands against the
            sewar in Roase aley' – not true at the time of course, but within the year, on 29
            September 1605, his lease of the Little Rose estate expired.<note type="foot">See <ptr

            related property maintenance costs.<note type="foot">See <ptr

            the theatre business (mainly 1591/2–1604), including playhouse repairs, income from play
            performances, loans to actors and playwrights; his pawn business (1593–6); and other

          <p>The treasure trove of personal papers belonging to <rs ref="eats:153045"
              type="Person_Commoner">Edward Alleyn</rs>, actor and founder of <rs ref="eats:234772"
              type="Place_F_School">Dulwich College</rs>, includes important documents relating to
            Henslowe, his father-in-law, that remain preserved in the college archives. Many of
            these have been professionally photographed and made available through Grace Ioppolo's
            open access <title>Henslowe-Alleyn Digitisation Project</title> website, to which this
            collection is much indebted and linked wherever relevant. The evolution of Henslowe as
            an entrepreneur – really the dominant entrepreneur – in the development of substantial
            landholdings along the south bank of the Thames can therefore be traced through the
            archives at Dulwich College and The National Archives in Kew. There, many court records
            of the Chancery and Exchequer reveal more about his lucrative Bankside estates, which
            became the focus of lengthy acrimonious disputes following his death in 1616.</p>
          <p>Philip Henslowe came from a prosperous gentry family with some social status in the
            county of Sussex. He was the fourth of seven children born to Edmond Henslowe (or
            Hensley) and Margaret Ridge, who resided near Lindfield, Sussex.<note type="foot">A
              succinct account of Henslowe's life has been provided by Susan Cerasano for the

            as master of the Game in neighbouring Ashdown Forest and Broil Park, so from the start,
            Philip had solid local foundations and a family court connection to build upon.<note

            been confirmed but has been tentatively placed <hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1555. He seems
            likely to have moved to the London area in the 1570s, where he surfaces as an apprentice
            to <rs ref="eats:202036" type="Person_Male">Harry Woodward</rs>, a member of the <rs ref="eats:237461" type="Collective_GuildsOccupational">Dyers'
              Company</rs>.<note type="foot">Dyers' Company records were lost in the Great Fire so
              details of the apprenticeship and the activities of Woodward himself cannot be
              traced; see the entry for the records of the Worshipful Company of Dyers (CLC/L/DC) in the <ref target="https://search.lma.gov.uk/">LMA catalogue</ref>.</note> It is possible that this was the Henry Woodward recorded in 1572 as
            resident of the Clink in the St Saviour's Token Books but where Henslowe lived in the
            1570s remains unconfirmed.<note type="foot">See <ref

                Saviour Southwark</ref>.</note> Certainly Harry Woodward's burial was entered in St
            Saviour's parish register on 8 December 1578, and not long after, his widow 'Annys
            Woodward' married Henslowe on 14 February 1578/9.<note type="foot">LMA:

            Henslowe's step-daughters but the couple did not have any children of their own. Joan's
            eventual marriage to Edward Alleyn, the star of the Admiral's Men, in 1592, would bring
            a deep and lasting personal and professional relationship for both men that would impact
            the Elizabethan theatre industry profoundly.</p>
          <p>Although Henslowe retained his identity as a member of the Dyers’ Company, his business
            interests ranged much more widely than the textile industry. Records are scanty for his
            activities until he commenced his acquisition of property on <rs ref="eats:229072"
              type="Place_F_Street">Bankside</rs> with the purchase of the lease for the Little Rose
            in 1584/5.<note type="foot">See <ref target="#background-property">History of the Rose
                Property</ref>.</note> From that purchase onward, Henslowe's strategic path to
            success in business, property development, and court appointments, as well as his rising
            social status in the parish of St Saviour's Southwark, is fascinating to trace.</p>
          <p>The purchase of the Little Rose lease was surely not a random choice. As the map of
            Southwark shows at a glance, the Little Rose property, adjacent on its west side to the
            Great Rose, was also only a few steps from the <rs ref="eats:227798"
              type="Place_F_Arena">Bear Garden</rs> flourishing then at the Bell and Cock site, a
            little further west of the Great Rose. Documentary evidence from the mid-sixteenth
            century confirms that <rs ref="eats:21767" type="Entertainment_AnimalSport">bear- and
              bullbaiting</rs> were likely the earliest form of popular entertainment on Bankside,
            apart from the notorious brothels that had lined the south bank of the river since at
            least the fourteenth century.<note type="foot">See further Carlin, 'Urban Development,'
              vol 2, pp 478–509.</note> In fact, a seventy-seven-year-old witness named <rs ref="eats:202291" type="Person_StatusOther">John Taylor</rs>
            in a 1620 court case recalled that there had been four bearbaiting arenas at various
            locations in Southwark over the course of decades.<note type="foot">Court of Exchequer
              Case: Attorney General v. William Henslowe and Jacob Meade, TNA: E134/18Jas1/Mich10,
              Item 5. A full transcription of this case is forthcoming in the Bear Gardens/Hope
              digital edition in the REED series, Stephanie Hovland and MacLean (eds).</note></p>
          <p>Some may have railed against bearbaitings at the time but, in the early 1580s it was
            the main game on the south bank and likely a lucrative one too. Much of the audience may
            have come across the river by ferry or on foot but there was also a long string of inns
            along the high street of Southwark leading to London Bridge, including the famous Tabard
            where Chaucer’s pilgrims gathered before their trek to Canterbury. When Henslowe
            arrived, the area was therefore already established for rough sports with audience
            appeal, but there was no playhouse yet. The only playhouse south of the river was much
            further south, at <rs ref="eats:227741" type="Place_F_Playhouse">Newington Butts</rs>,
            by then no longer under the management of the actor <rs ref="eats:202508"
              type="Person_Commoner">Jerome Savage</rs>, and less conveniently located. The <rs
              ref="eats:228217" type="Place_F_Playhouse">Theatre</rs> and the <rs ref="eats:228083"
              type="Place_F_Playhouse">Curtain</rs> were the only other playhouses open at this time
            but they were across the river, north of the city walls. Did Henslowe, a man with
            enterpreneurial instincts and considerable ambition, see an opportunity to expand the
            entertainment options on Bankside by building the first Southwark playhouse on the
            Little Rose site? The evidence suggests that he did.</p>
          <p>When Henslowe purchased the lease of the Little Rose, there no longer seems doubt that
            he had money of his own to invest, but his marriage to Harry Woodward's widow must have
            consolidated his financial position further. Judging by the terms of the lease, there
            were already houses and shops on the property, so he could count on steady income from
            rentals for at least twenty more years, when the lease had to be renewed.<note
              type="foot"><ptr target="#rosep-ridm90656952"/>.</note> But he may have had more on
            his mind than rental income.</p>
          <p>Within a short space of time, he must have hired the carpenter, <rs ref="eats:131126"
              type="Person_Commoner">John Griggs</rs>, to begin building a playhouse: by January
            1586/7, less than two years after the lease was signed, the deed of partnership with <rs
              ref="eats:130879" type="Person_Commoner">John Cholmley</rs> mentions the 'playe howse
            now in framinge.'<note type="foot">For the deed of partnership see <ptr
                target="#rosep-ridm90584488"/>. Mary Edmond, 'The Builder of the Rose Theatre,'
                <title>Theatre Notebook</title> 44.2 (1990), 50–4, provides further biographical
              information on John Griggs, Henslowe's builder and friend.</note> The partnership deed
            itself secured the details of Cholmley's involvement in running concessions for the Rose
            while also avoiding conflict over the location of the playhouse near the small house at
            the Little Rose, for which he probably held an ongoing sub-lease. It is evident,
            however, that it was Henslowe's initial investment that launched the development of the
            Rose.</p>
          <p>The exact opening date of the Rose is not recorded but it is generally agreed to have
            been in operation by October 1587, when some of the local residents had apparently
            complained of the new arrival on the Bankside scene. A letter from the privy council to
            the <rs ref="eats:160152" type="Collective_Office">Surrey justices of the peace</rs> on
            29 October 1587 outlines the protest as follows:</p>

          <quote type="block"><p>thinhabitaunts of Southwa<damage><gap unit="chars" extent="2"

              in Southwarke.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#rosep-ridm92853384"
            />.</note></p></quote>

          <p>There can be no doubt that the plays were performed at the Rose, the only playhouse
            located in the Clink at that time. In fact, more than a decade would elapse before the
              <rs ref="eats:227836" type="Place_F_Playhouse">Globe</rs> opened there on the south
            side of <rs ref="eats:229091" type="Place_F_Street">Maid Lane</rs>.</p>

          <p>With the opening of the Rose in 1587, Henslowe launched his role as a playhouse
            landlord in earnest. Sometime between 1587 and 1590 he may have attracted an acting
            troupe of notable talent to make the Rose their preferred base of operations. This
            company, possibly <rs ref="eats:153197" type="Collective_Troupe">Lord Strange’s
            Men</rs>, did not aim to pursue the provincial touring habits of their predecessors.
            Presumably they recognized the potential of the burgeoning entertainment market of
            London, even as Henslowe did, so finding a stable base for performance at the Rose would
            have been appealing. <note type="foot">See further Manley and MacLean, <title>Lord
                Strange's Men</title>, pp 37-63, for formation of the troupe and the apparent
              preference for London.</note></p>
          <p>Sometime during this same period Henslowe began expanding his network in various
            directions. By <hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1590, he had gained his first appointment at
            court. The <rs ref="eats:137174" type="Collective_Occupations">watermen's</rs> petition
            to the <rs ref="eats:25845" type="Person_Male">lord admiral</rs> is the first surviving
            record to refer to Henslowe as 'one of the groomes of her ma<ex>ies</ex>ties
            Chamber.'<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#rosep-ridm90877112"/>. For more detail on this and other court appointments
                throughout Henslowe's life, see Cerasano, 'Elizabethan Court,' p 50.</note>
            this time he also met and established an increasingly close relationship with Edward
            Alleyn, the leading actor of the Admiral's Men.</p>
          <p>Alleyn was born on 1 September 1566 in the parish of St Botolph without Bishopgate, the
            second of five sons born to a London innkeeper, Edward Alleyn (d. 1570) and Margaret
              Towneley.<note type="foot">For Alleyn's family origins and early life, see Cerasano,
              'Alleyn's Early Years,' 237–43; see also Cerasano's fuller biography of Alleyn,
              'Alleyn, Edward (1566–1626), actor, theatre entrepreneur, and founder of Dulwich
              College,' <title>ODNB</title>, accessed 5 January 2023, and Piggott, <title>Dulwich
                College</title>, pp 1–55.</note> Young Edward chose a different and more ambitious
            path than his father but retained an interest in the family's properties in Bishopsgate
            and, as his career and property acquisitions expanded, an even wider area north of the
            City wall.<note type="foot">See Cerasano, 'Alleyn's Early Years,' pp 238–40.</note>
            Edward Alleyn would make his name first in the early 1580s as an actor in the provinces
            with <rs ref="eats:48997" type="Collective_Troupe">Worcester's Men</rs> before moving to join his brother John in the <rs ref="eats:25827" type="Collective_Troupe">Lord Admiral's Men</rs> by
            1589, possibly even earlier.<note type="foot">For details on Worcester's Men and
              speculation about the date of Alleyn's move to the Lord Admiral's Men see Chambers,
                <title>Elizabethan Stage</title>, vol 2, pp 137–8; and Gurr, <title>Shakespearian
                Playing Companies</title>, pp 18, 232–4.</note> The Admiral's Men were featured at
            Court at Christmas 1588 and 1589, with subsequent appearances at Shrovetide both years;
            it is generally accepted that Alleyn had become a star performer by this time, his
            reputation established by his leading role in Marlowe's <title>Tamburlaine the
              Great</title>.<note type="foot">See further S.P. Cerasano, 'Edward Alleyn, the New
              Model Actor, and the Rise of the Celebrity in the 1590s,' <title>MRDE</title> 18
              (2005), 47–58, Manley and MacLean, <title>Lord Strange's Men</title>, p 55.</note></p>
          <p> The precise date when Alleyn left the Admiral's Men to combine forces with Strange's
            Men has not been established but sometime in the 1590–1 period is very plausible. The
            touring licence during the plague year issued to Strange's Men by the privy council on 6
            May 1593 includes Alleyn, still named as 's<ex>er</ex>uaunt to the right honorable the
              L<ex>ord</ex> highe Admiral,' but it also refers to the troupe as 'al one companie
              s<ex>er</ex>uant<ex>es</ex> to o<ex>u</ex>r verie good the L<ex>or</ex>d the

                <title>Elizabethan Stage</title>, vol 2, p 123.</note> Apparently Alleyn retained
            his individual affiliation with his influential patron, the lord admiral, but at some
            point moved to join Strange's Men at the Rose. In October 1592 he married Henslowe's
            step-daughter, Joan, so the personal bonds were strong from at least that year forward,
            if not before.<note type="foot"> For a biography of Alleyn's multi-faceted life, see Jan

          <p>An intriguing confusion in court records of payment for performances during the 1590/1
            Christmas and Shrovetide seasons may be evidence of an even earlier association of
            Alleyn with Henslowe and Strange's Men. The treasurer of the Chamber accounts record
            payment on 7 March 1590/1 to the actor <rs ref="eats:202577" type="Person_Commoner">George Attwell</rs>, on behalf of Strange's Men, for
            two performances by his company on 27 December 1590 and 16 February 1590/1.<note

            council, on a separate occasion on 5 March 1590/1, authorized warrants for payment
            instead to the Lord Admiral's Men for the performances on those same dates.<note

                International</title> 18.2 (1993), 85–93.</note> Rather, because Charles Howard, the
            lord admiral, was present at the 5 March privy council meeting, the official record made
            at the time acknowledged Alleyn's primary affiliation, in deference, though he was
            performing on both occasions with Strange's Men. In any case, Alleyn was to become
            Henslowe's key professional partner in several entertainment ventures and they were to
            prosper together for many years on Bankside and beyond. </p>
          <p>The history of the Rose playhouse itself will be outlined in the next section of this
            introduction. Following his older brother John's death in 1591, Henslowe inherited the
            memorandum book in which John had earlier recorded some of his Sussex mining accounts
              (1576–81).<note type="foot">See Cerasano, 'Henslowe's Biography,' pp 67–8, and Foakes,
                <title>Henslowe's Diary</title>, pp xix-xxiv.</note> By 19 February 1591/2 he had
            begun to add notes of his own, so a more detailed picture of theatrical performances and
            further renovations of the playhouse emerges, thanks to its survival – unique for the
            era. But Henslowe did not rest with managing this innovative venture. Rather, with
            Alleyn as partner, he moved ahead with what looks like a strategic plan to acquire more
            lands on Bankside as well as the monopoly on the lucrative bearbaiting enterprise. In
            December 1594 Edward Alleyn bought the lease of the Bear Garden properties at the Bell
            and Cock from <rs ref="eats:202643" type="Person_StatusOther">Thomas Burnaby</rs> – that purchase included an arena, bear house, bull house,
            cottage, stable, and hayloft. He also was licensed as a deputy by <rs ref="eats:199476" type="Person_Commoner">Ralph Bowes</rs>, then the
            court-appointed <rs ref="eats:160515" type="Collective_Office">master of the Bears, Bulls, and Mastiff Dogs</rs>, to hold games on the site,
            with obvious profits to be made from paying customers.<note type="foot">See Alleyn's

          <p>With the consolidation of property along Bankside, Henslowe and Alleyn began developing
            a joint venture for acquiring monopoly of the bearbaiting games there, including the
            court appointment as master of the Bears, Bulls, and Mastiff Dogs. The master had a
            number of privileges beyond the lustre of the court appointment. There was a reward each
            time a baiting was held at one of the royal palaces such as <rs ref="eats:124560"
              type="Place_F_Residence">Whitehall</rs> – and the queen, nobility, and foreign
            visitors did delight in this type of entertainment. The master also had sole right to
            license the many touring <rs ref="eats:21804" type="Entertainer_Type">bearwards</rs> on the provincial circuits, while also receiving a
            percentage of their profits. And then there were the profits from the Bear Garden
            itself, as well as from the breeding and sale of <rs ref="eats:357490" type="Entertainer_Type">mastiffs</rs>.<note type="foot">See further
              Cerasano, 'Master of the Bears,' pp 195–209.</note> There were expenses too, of
            course, but there is no doubt that Henslowe and Alleyn were aiming for the appointment
            soon after the acquisition of the Bear Garden lease at the Bell and Cock. Letters
            indicating that they held this ambition survive from 1598, the year when the master,
            Ralph Bowes, sickened and died. On 4 June, Henslowe wrote to Alleyn as follows: </p>

          <p>Very disappointingly, as Henslowe had suspected, <rs ref="eats:203796" type="Person_Commoner">John Dorrington</rs>, the gentleman
            pensioner of Nottinghamshire referred to above, was indeed appointed master of the

          <p>The mention in the letter of 'ower other matter betwext vs' is intriguing. By 1598
            Alleyn had taken his leave of the stage and would not return until the opening of a new
            playhouse in 1600 to be occupied by the Lord Admiral's Men – <rs ref="eats:63599" type="Place_F_Playhouse">the Fortune</rs>, located on
            Whitecross Street in the parish of St Giles without Cripplegate, just north of the city
            walls. Both Victor Landro and Susan Cerasano have persuasively argued that this move was
            at the planning stage for the two partners during Alleyn's brief retirement and predated
            Alleyn's acquisition of the lease for the site in December 1599.<note type="foot">For

            narrative that the Lord Admiral's Men were forced to abandon the Rose because of
            competition from the Globe after the <rs ref="eats:127834" type="Collective_Troupe">Lord

            Landro makes the telling point that the shifting demographic and a burgeoning new
            audience in the northern suburbs would not have escaped the notice of Henslowe and
            Alleyn, even as they expanded their business interests in the Bear Garden.<note
              type="foot">See Landro, ‘Henslowe’s Relocation,’ pp 37-8.</note> Finding a suitable
            property, securing funding, and negotiating a lease would have taken considerable time
            and would not likely have been deferred until 1599 by two partners as strategic in their
            thinking as Henslowe and Alleyn. When the neighbours were roused to protest construction
            of the new playhouse to the privy council early in 1600, Alleyn was well-positioned to
            appeal for support to his powerful patron, the lord admiral, and <rs ref="eats:11772" type="Person_Royalty">the queen</rs>, an
            appreciative member of the audience at his court performances in times past. Subsequent
            organization of support for the playhouse at the community level, with the promise of
            generous tithes for the local poor, won the day.<note type="foot">Documents relating to

            negotiations, but Henslowe supervised the construction process and assumed partnership
            of the Fortune in 1600, with 'a half-share of the playhouse and its profits for a term
            of twenty-four years at an annual rent of £8.'<note type="foot"> See further Landro,

          <p>Back on Bankside, the determined patience of the partners was rewarded in 1604 when
            Dorrington died. They moved quickly to purchase the patent for the mastership of the
            bears, bulls, and mastiff dogs from <rs ref="eats:203965" type="Person_Gentry">Sir William Stewart</rs>, a Scottish friend of James I
            who was first recipient of the royal appointment. £450 was the charge for the privilege,
            a hefty sum that Henslowe and Alleyn were nonetheless able to muster for this
            long-desired and prestigious position.<note type="foot">The royal patent for the
              appointment was recorded on 24 November 1604; see TNA: C66/1648, mbs 27–8. A partial

          <p>It is worth noting that Alleyn retired permanently from his acting career around the
            same time. By 1604 patronage of the Admiral's Men had been taken over by the heir to the
            throne, Prince Henry. As leader of the <rs ref="eats:188015" type="Collective_Troupe">Prince's Men</rs> in <rs ref="eats:17496" type="Person_Male">King James'</rs> deferred coronation
            progress of 15 March 1603/4, Alleyn joined the glittering occasion to deliver a speech
            as Genius Urbis at the first pageant arch in Fenchurch Street, but it may have been one
            of his final appearances.<note type="foot">For the account of the master of the Great

          <p>Henslowe's decision to abandon renewal of the lease on the Rose in 1605 may have been
            the result of several factors, not only the proposed increase in cost of the lease.
            Since 1600 there had not been any continuity in companies resident at the aging
            playhouse, while the Lord Admiral's Men were soon flourishing at the new Fortune.
            Furthermore, the serious recurrence of plague in 1603 led to lengthy closure of the
            London area playhouses. Henslowe's Bankside priority in this period may well have been
            renovation of the Bear Garden although he also continued his acquisition of other
            properties, picking up the lease of the Great Pike Garden further west along Bankside in
              1609.<note type="foot">See Warner, <title>Catalogue</title>, vol 1, p 141, for MS V, f
              44 (not reproduced on the <title>Henslowe-Alleyn Digitisation Project</title>
              website).</note> All of his properties had houses and shops that brought regular
            income to the owner of the lease, so Henslowe was by no means dependent on the quirky
            and unpredictable fortunes of his first playhouse. Around the same time Alleyn was
            building his own substantial estate, soon acquiring the manor of Dulwich in the Surrey
            countryside where he eventually relocated.<note type="foot">He noted his purchase of the
              manor of Dulwich from Sir Francis Calton in his memorandum book on 20 October 1605 for
              £5,000, with regular payments due over seven years; see Ioppolo,
              <title>Henslowe-Alleyn Digitisation Project</title>, MS VIII, f <ref target="https://henslowe-alleyn.org.uk/catalogue/mss-8/008-verso"
                >8v</ref>. Alleyn also purchased
              the manors of Lewisham, Kent, in 1600 and Kennington, Surrey, in 1604; see Piggott,
                <title>Dulwich College</title>, p 29.</note> Perhaps for financial reasons, he
            therefore sold Henslowe his share in the Bear Garden in 1610/11, though he retained the
            share in the mastership and the Fortune playhouse operation.<note type="foot">DC: MS

          <p xml:id="background-henslowe-status">An increase in status at court was not only
            confirmed by acquisition of the mastership of the Bears, Bulls, and Mastiff Dogs, but
            also by Henslowe's royal appointment in 1603 as a gentleman sewer of the Chamber.<note

            promising. The vestry minutes of St Saviour's in 1598 note anxiety about the playhouses
            located within their parish boundaries: by 1595 <rs ref="eats:151032"

              type="Place_F_Playhouse">Swan theatre</rs> had opened in the manor of Paris Garden,
            just west of Bankside. On 19 July the following order was recorded:</p>

          <quote type="block"><p>Inprimis it was ordered at this vestrye that a petic<ex>i</ex>on

          <p>There had been a previous order in May (renewed twice) that the churchwardens ask the
            playhouse owners to contribute tithes for the poor, but no evidence survives that they
            did so. However, as Paul White explains further in his forthcoming essay, 'Philip
            Henslowe and Edward Alleyn in Parish Politics and Service,' the social capital to be
            gained from actively participating in the lay leadership of his home parish was not lost
            on Henslowe. 'One needed to have lived in the parish for at least eight years to be a
            vestryman, but Henslowe’s name in the Token Books as a communicant in the Spring of
            1588, and just about every year thereafter, indicates that he fulfilled that requirement
            by about 1596 and was a parishioner in good standing. He was certainly wealthy enough
            and sufficiently well-connected at court in the 1590s to have qualified for the vestry.
            Moreover, he was a commissioner of the lay subsidy in 1593, 1594, and 1597, a
            prestigious appointment and reserved usually for vestrymen.'<note type="foot">See Ingram

            On 8 July 1607 Henslowe was at last appointed to vestry and became a regular attender at
            the almost monthly meetings despite his many other responsibilities. The following year
            in 1608 he was chosen churchwarden, a term renewed in 1609. In the latter year he was

          <p>Following the closure of the Rose in 1605 (if not before), the final phase of
            Henslowe's career needs only be covered briefly here. Although Alleyn would continue to
            develop diversified interests elsewhere, Henslowe's focus seems to have been more on
            Bankside where he lived. By <hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1612 he began planning for another
            playhouse that would combine what had been separate enterprises at the now demolished
            Rose and the ongoing Bear Garden. In 1613, with another partner, the waterman <rs
              ref="eats:152268" type="Person_Commoner">Jacob Meade</rs> who had been working at the
            Bear Garden since the late '90s, he conceived of a multi-purpose entertainment centre
            with a removeable stage, that could mount weekly plays, <rs ref="eats:21767"
              type="Entertainment_AnimalSport">animal baitings</rs> (at least bi-weekly), and other

            construction of the <rs ref="eats:227893" type="Place_F_Playhouse">Hope</rs> have
            survived to show us that Henslowe had in mind a playhouse to rival in size and beauty,
            not the Globe, but rather the Swan, which seems to have ceased long since as a
            competitive operation.<note type="foot">Transcriptions of DC: Mun 49 and 51 will be

          <quote type="block"><p>Historically Henslowe represented the manager of the future at an
              early stage of development. Yet his ability to function as a manager or producer was
              blocked by the structure of the acting company. In fact, the two could not co-exist.
              Shared responsibility among working actors not only followed different procedures of
              decision-making but had no room for managerial guidance. The company needed financing
              but not control and, in fact, resisted control by a single individual ... .'<note

          <p>Beckerman suggested that four periods can be identified in the growth of Henslowe's
            role as a proto-theatre manager.<note type="foot">Beckerman, 'Henslowe,' p 28. Gurr,
                <title>Shakespeare's Opposites</title>, pp 82–3, seems to accept Beckerman's
              identification of the four phases, while noting that the diary does not always reveal
              which role, whether as landlord or banker, Henslowe was assuming when he made his
              account entries.</note></p>

          <p>In the first phase at the Rose (up to 1596–7), Henslowe was acting primarily as a
            landlord, with less direct involvement in the company's operations. The second, 'late
            Rose-early Fortune,' period, ran from mid-1596 to early 1604, a time when playing
            companies were challenged by increasing efforts by the authorities in London and on the
            privy council to control the number of playhouses and their operation, while they also
            faced more competition and plague closures. Henslowe seems to have attempted greater
            involvement as banker with Lord Admiral's Men during this period, offering loans to the
            company during seasons of declining performance income at the Rose or at Court (for
            example, 1596–7, when they were not invited). Carson's review of evidence in the diary
            for these years notes an extension of involvement in company affairs: 'Beginning in the
            Spring-Summer season of 1598, Henslowe seems to have provided most of the money spent on
            playbooks, costumes, and properties by Admiral's Men.'<note type="foot">

            initiated the idea of requiring actors to sign bonds with him before playing at the
            Swan, Henslowe was to follow his example in adopting this deeper involvement in the
            affairs of the Lord Admiral's Men. Entries in the diary show that he required the
            disaffected actors recruited from Pembroke's Men, as well as others, totalling ten
            altogether, to guarantee that they would play only at the Rose for stated terms ranging
            from one to three years.<note type="foot">Beckerman, 'Henslowe,' pp 36–42, outlines the
              details of the loans to the company and the players' bonds established by Langley and
              Henslowe during these years. See also Foakes, <title>Diary</title>, pp 238–41, for the
              bonds for Richard Jones, Robert Shaa, William Bird (alias Borne), Thomas Downton,
              Thomas Hearne, John Helle, Richard Allen, Thomas Heywood, Charles Massy, and Samuel
              Rowley. See further, <ref target="#background-playhouse">History of the
                Playhouse</ref>.</note> As this new approach was happening in 1597, Alleyn retired
            from the stage, leaving Henslowe to manage relations with the company more directly.
            However, despite their apparent dependency on periodic financial loans, the evidence
            suggests that he was unable to assert substantial control of the management of the Lord
            Admiral's Men, who repaid their debts whenever they could. 'It would appear that the
            landlord was satisfied to lend money to the players in order to keep them at his
            theatre, where he earned a more than satisfactory income from rent,' Carson
              observes.<note type="foot"><title>Companion</title>, p 27. A more recent review of the
              evidence for Henslowe's evolving management style at the Rose has been done by Mao,
              'Rose Playhouse,' pp 146–59.</note> In other words, the gain was stability for the
            playhouse operation rather than control of the company's productions while in residence
              there.<note type="foot">The goal of 'stability' was recognized by Beckerman,
              'Henslowe,' p 43.</note></p>
          <p>The third period highlights Henslowe's management of the Bear Garden, in partnership
            with Alleyn until 1610. The fourth and final phase Beckerman termed the 'Hope period,'
            beginning in 1611 when the new company of Lady Elizabeth's Men first signed articles of
            agreement with Henslowe.<note type="foot">See further Siobhan Keenan, <title>Acting

            dealings with Lady Elizabeth's Men. When he and Jacob Meade launched work on the Hope
            playhouse on Bankside in 1613, they were making plans for Lady Elizabeth's Men to be

          <p>When Henslowe died on 6 January 1615/16, he was a man of wealth and property, drawing
            income from numerous rentals, various court appointments, and successful business
            ventures that centred on entertainment, primarily on Bankside. He appears to have kept
            his investments and partnerships under effective control during his lifetime; after his
            death, however, the rights to his estate became subject to bitter conflict and
            interminable court cases.<note type="foot">These will be included in the forthcoming
              REED edition for the Bear Gardens/Hope
              records<!--IN: Link to BG/Hope to be inserted here-->.</note> Was Henslowe really
            worth the £10,000 to £12,000 that his avaricious nephew claimed and clearly wanted a
            slice of? Poor Agnes, who inherited the bulk of the estate, was described in a dispute
            over the will, as ‘aged almost 100 yeares and grown Childishe and very simple.’ Edward
            Alleyn was accused of ‘most cunninglie’ insinuating himself into the process of drawing
            up a version of the will during Henslowe’s final hours.<note type="foot">TNA: C 33/133 A
              (17 November 1616), ff 240v–1.</note> For quite a few years a formerly functional
            family and partnership fell into disarray, but it is worth noting that Alleyn, also a
            man of influence and strategy, was well-placed as son-in-law to Agnes Henslowe to
            inherit much of the estate left to her by her husband.</p>

          <p>Henslowe's earliest entries in the diary indicate his likely acquisition of the

            diary does not have a complete and readily understood accounting of the full run of
            plays performed and profits taken throughout the almost twenty years of theatrical
            activity at the Rose. As Neil Carson noted after his detailed analysis of the contents,
            'It is difficult to imagine how Henslowe could have supervised his various business
            enterprises without a fuller set of books including, at the very least, a ledger in
            which he would have recorded his transactions with individuals. If such books existed,
            possibly they became separated from the diary at the time of Henslowe's death. Whatever
            the truth, we must recognize, I think, that the diary contains only a partial record of
            Henslowe's activities, albeit a record maintained by a reasonably painstaking
              individual.'<note type="foot">See Carson, <title>Companion</title>, p 8, and his
              summary, p 13.</note> It is worth emphasizing that some of the documents in the

            acquisition of the collection, could have been mislaid or lost much later. When George
            Warner, Keeper of Manuscripts at the British Museum, first examined and catalogued the
            surviving Henslowe-Alleyn papers in the 1880s, he noted that Edmond Malone, who first
            discovered the diary, was allowed to take possession of 'many curious manuscripts
            relative to the stage' which he kept until his death.<note type="foot"> Warner,

            Boswell, his literary executor; but some of the papers which he published as belonging
            to the collection are no longer to be found in it, and how many more disappeared, of

          <p>There is no reason to assume that Henslowe did not keep a record, however informal, of
            his playhouse business between the opening of the Rose in 1587, and February 1591/2, but
            that record has not survived so we must piece together from various sources what
            evidence is available centuries later. While building contracts survive for both the the

          <p>In very brief summary of the archaeological discovery, the developer group Imry
            Merchant acquired the site, intending to demolish the existing 1957 office block named
            Southbridge House before erecting a new building now known as Rose Court. A short-term,
            ten-week archaeological assessment and excavation was required by the Southwark Council
            before construction could commence and was funded by the developer. However, ten weeks
            rapidly turned into six months, as Blatherwick and Pickard explain: 'The totality of the
            survival of those remains plus the unprecedented public response towards the extant
            structure, associated with both William Shakespeare and the development of modern
            English dramatic tradition, had a major impact on national policy towards archaeological
            remains in England and on public awareness of the potential of urban archaeological
            remains. After negotiations in the late spring of 1989, most of the archaeological
            remains of The Rose were preserved <hi rend="italic">in situ</hi> by the introduction of
            a protective "environmental" regime and the re-design of the piling configuration on
            which the new development was to sit.'<note type="foot">'Little Rose Estate,' pt 1, p

          <p>Only two-thirds of the site could be excavated at the time, so the eastern side of the
            playhouse remains to discover. What has been uncovered reveals that the original
            structure was a thatched timber-framed polygon consisting of fourteen sides
            approximately 72' in diameter. There were two rings of walls surrounding an open yard,
            with no reliable proof of the exact location of the exterior entrance into the yard,
            although evidence suggests that it would have been at the south end near the main access
            to the site across the bridge over the sewer at <rs ref="eats:229091"
              type="Place_F_Street">Maid Lane</rs>.<note type="foot">'See Bowsher and Miller,
                <title>Rose and the Globe</title>, pp 111, 114. It may also be indicative that the
              entrance door to the playhouse is shown at the south end on both versions of John
              Norden's map (1593 and 1600).</note> The stage, tapered in shape, projected out into the north section of
            the yard between bays 6 and 10, delimited by the inner wall at the north. Bowsher
            summarizes its measurements – which surprised many scholars at the time – as follows:
            'At the front it had three edges, a long central one and two tapering shorter sides. It
            thus had a depth of 5m (16ft 5in.) and an estimated maximum width of 11.5m (36ft 9in.)
            narrowing to 8.2m (26ft 10in.) at the front, covering an area of about 46.4m (499.45sq
            ft).... The wooden boards of the actual stage would certainly have been raised above the
            level of the yard, perhaps by 1.52m (5ft) as recorded at the Red Lion. The front stage
            wall at the Rose survives to a height of about 0.12m (4 3/4in.) above the yard but flush
            with the surface under the stage. It was therefore a permanent feature, unlike the
            temporary trestles employed at the later Hope....'<note type="foot">Bowsher, <title>Rose
                Theatre</title>, 39–40. Given the fixed stage, Bowsher, in a later essay, refutes
              the speculation that the Rose might have been first intended to serve as a bearbaiting
              arena before serving as a playhouse, an idea floated by Jon Greenfield and Andrew Gurr
              in 'The Rose Theatre, London: The State of Knowledge and What We Still Need to Know,'
                <title>Antiquity</title> 78 (June 2004), 330–40. See further Bowsher, 'The Rose and
              its Stages,' <title>Shakespeare Survey</title> 60 (2007), 36–48.</note> There was no
            evidence of supporting pillar bases for a roof overhanging the stage, or of a projecting
            tiring house: the area between the outer and inner back walls of the stage likely served
            the latter purpose.<note type="foot">Bowsher, <title>Rose Theatre</title>, p 69, n 11,
              cites two articles by Glynne Wickham that point out that neither a trap nor 'heavens'
              would have been required for plays mounted in the early Elizabethan playhouses,
              including those of Marlowe at the Rose: 'Notes on the Staging of Marlowe's Plays,'

            the existence of a trap door below the stage cannot be confirmed, though both remain
            subject to speculation. See, for example, one of the archaeologists, Bowsher, on the
            subject of a trapdoor: 'The stage surface itself is assumed to have been wooden boards,
            raised well above the yard surface. Within the footprint of the stage was a plaster
            surface that would suggest that there was an under stage area or void, which might have
            provided storage room and access on to the stage proper through a trapdoor.'<note

          <p>According to Bowsher, the open yard, of friable grey mortar, where the groundlings

              provides details that we can only wish we had for the upper structure of the
              Rose.</note> The northern section of the yard had a notable slope, raked to the front
            of the stage. No evidence of an exterior stair tower, interior staircase, or the number
            of galleries was discovered, though either two or three galleries seem likely. </p>
          <p>This building, as partially revealed at its foundation level by archaeologists in 1989,
            was the Rose, built by the carpenter John Griggs in partnership with Philip Henslowe and
            opened sometime before October 1587. At the end of that month the neighbours were
            complaining to the authorities that the <rs ref="eats:351822" type="Collective_Office">privy council</rs> order restraining plays on the
            sabbath was being ignored in the <rs ref="eats:223826" type="Place_PA_Liberty">liberty
              of the Clink</rs>.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#rosep-ridm92853384"/>.</note> A
            previous letter on 7 May 1587 from the privy council to the Surrey JPs, ordering the
            inhibition of plays during the heat of the summer months, might imply the opening of the
            Rose sooner than has been assumed, but the letter is not specific enough to confirm an
            earlier date of opening.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#rosep-ridm92788552"

          </p>
          <p>There is no direct documentary evidence known about the company or companies first
            hired to play at the Rose. A common assumption has been that <rs ref="eats:153197"
              type="Collective_Troupe">Lord Strange's Men</rs> arrived there just as Henslowe began
            using his famous memorandum book. Furthermore, the speculative dating of 1592 or 1593
            has been typically assigned to the petition from Strange's Men to the privy council and
            the <rs ref="eats:137174" type="Collective_Occupations">watermen's</rs> companion
            petition to the <rs ref="eats:25845" type="Person_Male">lord admiral</rs> pleading for
            the reopening of the Rose, as well as the privy council's response in lifting the
            restraint on playing there.<note type="foot">See, for example, Chambers,
                <title>Elizabethan Stage</title>, vol 4, p 311, who suggests a date of July 1592
              following the restraint of playing at the Rose from 23 June 1592 after the Feltmakers'
              apprentices' recent riot in Southwark. For associated records, see: <ptr

                target="#rosep-ridm90700072"/>.</note> However, Alan H. Nelson has studied the
            seventeen signatures on the watermen’s petition, discovering from his St Saviour's
            parish register research that two of those signing were dead by 1591.<note type="foot"
              >Nelson has not yet published his 2012 conference paper, ‘Philip Henslowe and the
              Bankside Watermen: A Fresh Look at Three Familiar Documents’ (paper, University of

                Strange’s Men</title>, pp 50–1.</note> Given that the earlier of the two men's death
            dates was January 1590/1, the previous summer of 1590 therefore becomes a viable date
            for the petitions and, just possibly, the year before.</p>
          <p>Strange's Men were a large company performing plays by some of the best in the business
            – <rs ref="eats:200254" type="Person_Commoner">Marlowe</rs>, <rs ref="eats:200322" type="Person_Commoner">Kyd</rs>, and <rs ref="eats:200390" type="Person_Commoner">Greene</rs> among others, and quite likely including a young <rs ref="eats:199852" type="Person_Commoner">Shakespeare</rs>
            by 1592.<note type="foot">For an in-depth study of the first known company resident at

            Henslowe was forced to close the playhouse temporarily <hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1590,
            for as yet unknown reasons, the players protested ‘oure Companie is greate, and <term

            watermen,' who benefitted from ferrying the constant traffic across the Thames to the
            theatre. The reference to the players' hope of a command performance before the queen is
            worth remarking on. Some of the most seasoned actors of the day had joined Lord
            Strange's Men following the death of their previous patron, the <rs ref="eats:44753"
              type="Person_Male">earl of Leicester</rs>, in September 1588.<note type="foot">For
              details of <rs ref="eats:48635" type="Collective_Troupe">Leicester's Men</rs> and the
              formation of their new company, see <title>Lord Strange's Men</title>, pp 30–6.</note>
            During the Christmas and Shrovetide seasons, 1590–90/1, they were to perform twice at
            court, so their anticipation of such a lucrative opportunity, <hi rend="italic">c</hi>
            1590, was not unfounded. As noted in the previous section, Edward Alleyn, the star actor
            from Lord Admiral's Men, would join them soon, possibly as early as these first court
            performances, so they must have rapidly become a major attraction on Bankside. The
            following year they were invited to perform an unprecedented six plays at court during
            the festive season, so it is likely that they would have continued to prefer residency
            at the Rose the rest of the year rather than touring the provinces.</p>
          <p>At some point during 1591–2, Henslowe renovated his playhouse, perhaps in response to
            the remarkable success of the resident acting company. Early in his diary, ff 4–5v, he
            notes, in itemized detail, 'such carges as I haue layd owt a bowte my playe howsse in
            the year of or lord 1592.'<note type="foot">See Foakes, <title>Henslowe's Diary</title>,
              pp 9–13, and the <title>Henslowe-Alleyn Digitisation Project</title>, MS 7, ff <ref

              >4–5v</ref>.</note> The costs were considerable, totalling around £108.<note
              type="foot">Carson, <title>Companion</title>, pp 14–15.</note> The 1989 archaeological
            excavation of the site revealed some of these structural renovations made to the
            playhouse with the assistance of the original builder, John Griggs. The alterations were
            focused on rebuilding the northern end of the site to allow for an increase in audience
            capacity and improved staging conditions. The stage was newly constructed: as Bowsher
            describes, it was '...built 2.1m (6ft 10 1/2in.) farther north than the original. It had
            a depth of 5.6m (18ft 4in.) and it is estimated to have been 8.4m (27ft 7in.) long,
            although its front length was not fully uncovered by our excavation. This would have
            provided a complete stage area of about 50.5m<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> (543.58 sq
            ft).... Although its dimensions were not much larger than those of the first stage, it
            was slightly more rectangular and gave the impression of a greater "thrust" because of
            the extension of the yard on each side of it.'<note type="foot">Bowsher, <title>Rose
                Theatre</title>, pp 48–50. See also Bowsher, 'Twenty Years On: The Archaeology of
              Shakespeare's London Playhouses,' <title>Shakespeare</title>, 7.4 (2011), 461–2, who
              describes this as the archaeologists' most important discovery. While the shape of the
              stage may have remained largely unchanged, '[h]itherto the actors were largely acting
              in one, forward, direction. With the extra space at the sides of the second Rose stage
              acting had to be in three directions.' The result would have benefitted the actors as
              the improvement provided 'a greater scope for interaction with the audience.'</note>
            Surviving evidence of pillars close to the front corners of the stage suggests that a
            roof for full stage cover was provided for the first time, thereby necessitating the
            widening outward of the galleries to the east and west to preserve sight lines. The yard
            was thus substantially expanded by an estimated thirty-nine per cent 'to cover about
              163m<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> (1754 1/2sq ft)'.<note type="foot">Bowsher,
                <title>Rose Theatre</title>, p 51.</note> It was barely raked, in contrast to the
            incline of the first, and the original mortar was replaced with a mix of compacted
            earth, cinder, and cracked hazelnut shells.<note type="foot">Full details of the second
              phase of the building discovered during the archaeological excavation in 1989 are

              with photographs of the site and an architectural drawing, fig 50.</note> Henslowe's
            own renovation notes on f 5v of the diary indicate the addition of a 'penthowwse shed'
            added at the tiring house door behind the stage, but no trace was found of its
            construction or precise site during the excavation. He also refers for the first time to
            a lords' room and its ceiling but the location of this special seating area was not
            revealed either.<note type="foot">See Foakes, <title>Henslowe's Diary</title>, p 13;

            The playhouse, as renovated by 1592, appears at the centre, mislabelled as 'The stare,'

            the period between 1588 and 1605. The small tenement in the corner at the south-west end

          <p>As the diary confirms, <!-- IN: Maybe link to events here at a later date?--> in 1592–3
            Lord Strange's Men performed at Henslowe's Rose, with an extended run from 19
            February–22 June 1592, and another from 29 December 1592–1 February 1592/3. It seems
            improbable that they would have mounted their plays during the period of reconstruction
            of the north end of the playhouse, so the February/March 1591/2 dates of Henslowe's
            'carges' would seem to favour Neil Carson's assessment that the receipts were probably
            submitted some time after the work was completed.<note type="foot">Carson,

              construction costs would have been paid in arrears if their work preceded the

          <p>External events, however, would disrupt the continuous operation of the Rose in the
            early 1590s. The first followed the performance of

            on 22 June. On 23 June the privy council ordered the closure of playhouses in London and
            the suburbs until Michaelmas, out of concern for the potential of further unrest and
            disorder at Midsummer that might be triggered by London apprentices.<note type="foot"
              >See <ptr target="#rosep-ridm92855896"/>.</note> This order was clearly in response to
            the <rs ref="eats:133707" type="Person_Commoner">mayor of London's</rs> letter of 12
            June outlining 'moste outrageous and tumultuous' events that had happened recently when

            served as the pretext for the assembly of Feltmakers’ apprentices in Southwark was not
            named, the Rose would have been the only playhouse available for a performance there.
            However reluctant they may have been, this very large and successful company of
            Strange's Men was therefore forced to tour the provinces, with some of their performance
            stops on record, starting with an appearance at Rye in Sussex on 24 June.<note

          <p>The second season in repertory at the Rose began soon after the first of six
            performances at court on 27 December. Between 29 December and 1 February 1592/3
            Strange's Men were back in residence but a serious outbreak of plague led to another
            privy council order on 28 January for closure of all London area theatres, a restriction
            that would endure for the duration of 1593.<note type="foot">See <ptr

            1594. <rs ref="eats:153107" type="Person_Nobility">Ferdinando Stanley</rs>, Lord

            patronage elsewhere. When the key players resumed activities in mid-1594 they were

            the Stationers' Register on 6 February 1593/4, may hold a clue to temporary amalgamation
            of some of the actors from each company in the attribution 'Plaide by the Right

          <p>During this period of plague and uncertainty for acting companies and playhouse owners,
            Edward Alleyn seems to have joined the reformed Lord Admiral’s Men. No surprise,
            perhaps, that Henslowe's son-in-law and partner Alleyn, who was also the lead actor of
            the company, would accept Henslowe's offer to make their base at the Rose. Between 14
            May 1594 and 13 July 1600 the Lord Admiral's Men began a long-term engagement at the
            Rose that was broken only by periodic interventions by the privy council when plague
            fears resurfaced, by required closures during Lent, or by very occasional disruptive
              events.<note type="foot">See Foakes, <title>Henslowe's Diary</title>, pp 21–35, and

            tours in the provinces but their preference was clearly for London and the court where

            exception of 1596–7).<note type="foot">For performances at court, see Gurr, 'Appendix
              4,' <title>Shakespeare's Opposites</title>, p 293.</note></p>
          <p>The first interruption in the new arrangement between Henslowe and the re-formed Lord
            Admiral's Men seems to have occurred between 17 May and 14 June 1594. From 3–13 June

            Johnson has recently done an in-depth study of this relatively unknown and little
            documented playhouse and its brief glory days when two famous Elizabethan companies
            brought their talents to its stage. He proposes that extreme weather and flooding on the
            marshy Bankside during the 1594 'year of floods' must have caused Henslowe's move to
            negotiate rental of an alternative space with the Newington Butts owner, <rs
              ref="eats:133645" type="Person_Commoner">Peter Hunningborne</rs>: 'I suggest the
            ongoing rain and spates of high waters took their toll on Henslowe's Bankside venue,
            forcing him to consider viable alternatives, and Newington's indoor venue on high ground
            would seem to have been just that.'<note type="foot">Johnson, <title>Shakespeare's Lost

              of dramatic records for Newington Butts will be forthcoming in the REED series.</note>
            Whether the two companies performed the seven plays mounted there together (some more
            than once) or alternated, remains the subject of ongoing debate, as Henslowe groups his
            entries together under a common heading and the exact number and membership of the
            companies during this era of formation are not known.<note type="foot">See, for example,

          <p>When the Lord Admiral's Men returned to the Rose on 15 June, they settled in for a long
            residency, their almost daily performances for the following year disrupted only by
            performances at court on 28 December and 1 and 6 January.<note type="foot">They ended
              their first run on 26 June 1595; see Foakes, <title>Henslowe's Diary</title>, p 30.
              For a succinct chart of performance dates and related payments for the Rose,
              1594–1600, the 'Chronological Abstract of the Diary in so far as it Relates to
              Dramatic Affairs' provided by Greg, <title>Diary</title>, vol 2, pp 328–32, remains
              useful and is not repeated here. Chambers, <title>Elizabethan Stage</title>, vol 2, pp
              141–3, 159–60, also summarizes the dates of opening and closing at the Rose, as
              witnessed, not always consistently, by Henslowe.</note> In fact, Henslowe's accounting
            practices between 15 June 1594 and 5 November 1597 allow a relatively reliable view of
            the repertory schedule at the Rose before he shifts to a notably different style of
            record. Gurr has traced the membership, performances, repertory practices, and play
            texts during the company's sojourn at the Rose in detail in his study of the company in

            studies of the company and its career at the Rose include Chambers' summary in

              <title>Henslowe's Diary</title> with extensive commentary and tables of reference in
            volume 2.</p>
          <p>Wiggins and Richardson account for 173 plays and one <rs ref="eats:363265" type="Entertainment_Type">jig</rs>, with a further eight and

            primarily in Henslowe's diary or in the Stationers' Register up to the summer of 1600.

          <p>In July 1598, a further, apparently futile appeal to the privy council was made by

            on Bankside the following year when the Globe opened on the south side of Maid Lane, not
            far from the Rose. This playhouse, too, is shown on Norden's 1600 inset map. Much has
            been made in times past of the competition that would thereby ensue between the Lord
            Admiral's Men and the Chamberlain's Men newly relocated from the <rs ref="eats:228217"
              type="Place_F_Playhouse">Theatre</rs> to the Globe in 1599. Did Henslowe respond by
            laying plans to move his enterprise in retreat to the north of the city where the <rs
              ref="eats:63599" type="Place_F_Playhouse">Fortune playhouse</rs> would open in the
            autumn of 1600? Roslyn Knutson has argued persuasively against a narrative inherited
            from Chambers that when Henslowe changed his style of accounting towards the end of 1597
            to record more loans to the company and partial payments to playwrights it must mean
            that the Lord Admiral's Men fell on hard times and 'lived from hand to mouth, and had
            acquired the thriftless habit of sharing their profits weekly or even daily, and keeping
            no reserve fund.'<note type="foot">See 'The Commercial Significance of the Payments for

              vol 2, p 162, for the unjustified depiction of the playwrights as 'extremely
              out-at-elbows men of letters who hung about the Rose' and 'occasionally found it
              profitable to take their "earnest" for a play, and then to find plausible reasons for
              indefinitely delaying its completion.'</note> Instead, when focusing on the 'crucial
            year' of 1599–1600, 'which has the highest incidence of partial payments in the diary,'
            Knutson does a close analysis of the accounts and concludes as follows: 'I suggest that
            over the years of 1597–1603 the Admiral's men maintained a large repertory of new and
            old plays on a variety of popular subjects and in a variety of dramatic kinds; that in
            1599–1600 they increased the number of works-in-progress that they usually financed in
            order to acquire an even larger, newer, and more diversified set of offerings; that in
            1600–1, they eased the burden of expenses by continuing plays already in repertory and
            by reviving a few old favorities; that in 1601–2 they increased the number of revivals,
            which not only were relatively inexpensive to produce but also served as a showcase for
            Alleyn's return to the stage.'<note type="foot">Knutson, ‘Commercial Significance,’ p
              131. An earlier article by Neil Carson, 'Production Finance at the Rose Theatre,
              1596–98,' <title>Theatre Research International</title> 4 (1979), 172–83, also
              questioned the dominant narrative, pointing out through close analysis of various
              sources of evidence between 1596–8 that the diary does not consistently record all
              expenses and income and so cannot be relied upon as a comprehensive witness to
              playhouse operations.</note>

          <p>The probability that Henslowe and Alleyn together had conceived of a strategic move to
            the north side of the Thames before the Theatre was dismantled and the Globe opened on
            Bankside has been discussed in the previous section, where links to the relevant records
            in this collection can be found. The January 1599/1600 warrant from the <rs

            an accurate reflection of the Rose's condition or simply designed to make a persuasive
            case for the move of the Lord Admiral's Men to the desired new location could be
            debated. However, the privy council picked up the theme in support of Alleyn's building
            project in their 8 April order, followed by an order on 22 June legislating only two

          <p>It is evident that despite the notional 'decay' of the Rose and official attempts to
            reduce the number of playhouses on Bankside, Henslowe continued to maintain its
            operation regardless of the loss of the Lord Admiral's Men to the fair new Fortune that
            he and Alleyn had opened in 1600. The diary's accounts during this period are quite
            sporadic for the Rose and there is no consistent evidence of residency by a single
            company. On a new folio Henslowe begins to record performances by Pembroke's Men, but
            only two entries are made for 28–9 October.<note type="foot">See Foakes,

          <p>1603 was a year of national crisis. The aging <rs ref="eats:11772" type="Person_Royalty">queen's</rs> illness raised anxieties early in
            the year. The privy council's order of 19 March for the restraint of stage plays until
            further notice was probably in response.<note type="foot">See <ptr

            have been suspended in deference until after that date. Henslowe noted the suspension of
            play (again) on 5 May 1603 at the time of King James’ arrival.<note type="foot">See

                Shakespeare’s Theater</title>, pp 102–4</note> Henslowe does not record the ensuing
            long closure in his diary but he did make vigorous note of his resistance to the
            proposed rise in the cost of the lease on the Little Rose property revealed to him at a
            meeting on 25 June (see the <ref

          <p>Other historical sources indicate that the plague raging in London would have kept the
            playhouses closed until after Lent 1604, and even then the rest of that year was likely
            to have been disrupted by fresh outbreaks.<note type="foot">The original privy council
              registers for 1601/2–13 were destroyed by fire in 1618. However, Barroll,
                <title>Politics, Plague, and Shakespeare’s Theater</title>, pp 104–23, provides a
              detailed outline from other historic sources of the likely impact of the 1603–4 plague
              on Shakespeare's company, the <rs ref="eats:25345" type="Collective_Troupe">king's
                men</rs>, then resident at the Globe, but all London area playhouses would have felt
              the economic consequences.</note> Given these circumstances we might ask whether
            operations ceased at the Rose entirely by May 1603, with the onset of plague in London,
            Henslowe's other involvements at the Fortune and the Bear Garden, as well as practical
            concerns for the age and looming cost of improving and maintaining the Rose playhouse as
            of Michaelmas 1605 when the original lease on the Little Rose would expire. As outlined
            in the first section above, the Sewer Commission reports for 1605–6 indicate that
            Henslowe abandoned the lease and the playhouse; the archaeological analysis of the
            remains in 1989 appear to confirm that it was dismantled around the same time.<note

                Philip Henslowe, citizen and dyer of London, on the one party, and John Cholmley,
                citizen and grocer of London on the other party, witnesses that the said parties,

                presents, for and during and until the end and term of eighty years and three months
                from thence next ensuing, and fully to be complete and ended if the said parties do
                so long live, whereupon it is covenanted, granted, condescended, concluded, and
                agreed between the said parties by these presents. And the said Philip Henslowe, for

                the moiety, or one half, or all such sum and sums of money, gains, profit, and
                commodity which shall arise, grow, be collected, gathered, or become due for the
                said parcel of ground and playhouse, when and after it shall be erected and set up,
                by reason of any play or plays that shall be shown or played there or otherwise
                howsoever. And the said John Cholmley, for him, his executors and administrators,

                said term of eight years and three months, if the said Philip do so long live, to
                have, receive, take, and enjoy to his and their own proper use and behoof the other
                moiety, or one half of all such sum and sums of money, gains, profits, and
                commodity, which shall arise, grow, be collected, gathered, or become due, for the

                as aforesaid. And further, the said Philip Henslowe, for him, his executors and
                administrators, does covenant, promise, and grant, to and with the said John

                Cholmley, his executors, administrators and assigns, shall or may lawfully,

                the tenure of the said John Cholmley or his assigns, with free ingress, egress, and
                regress, way and passage, to and for the said John Cholmley, his executors or
                assigns, for any profit, or commodity, or for any other wise or causes whatsoever,

                river of Thames into the said parcel of ground, as also in and by and through the
                way leading into the same Maiden Lane, at all times convenient, at his and their
                liberties and pleasures, if the way be permitted and suffered by the lord and
                liberty, without any let, trouble, suit, eviction, expulsion, or interruption of the
                said Philip Henslowe, his executors, administrators, or assigns, or any of them, and
                without any lawful let, trouble, expulsion, or interruption of any other person or
                persons by his or their means, consent, right, title, interest, or procurement,
                during the said term of eight years and three months fully to be complete and ended.
                Likewise that he the said Philip, his executors or assigns, shall and will at his
                and their own proper cost and charges, with as much expedition as may be, erect,

                that the players take upon them to handle in their plays certain matters of divinity
                and of state unfit to be suffered, for redress whereof their lordships have thought
                good to appoint some persons of judgement and understanding to view and examine
                their plays, before they be permitted to present them publically, his lordship is
                desired that some fit person well learned in divinity be appointed by him to join
                with the master of the Revels and one other to be nominated by the lord mayor, and
                they jointly with some speed to view and consider of such comedies and tragedies as
                are and shall be publicly played by the companies of players in and about the city

                nominated by the lord archbishop of Canterbury for the reforming of the plays daily
                exercised and presented publically in and about the city of London, where the

            <p> The reference to 'this longe vacation' is usually interpreted as the summer months.
              Strange's Men are here arguing their case as persuasively as possible, with an evident
              awareness of the economic advantage to be gained from long-term residence at the
              Bankside playhouse, conveniently located for presenting London audiences with a
              repertory of plays that were to be documented in detail by <rs

              The reference to the concern that they be forced to divide and take the traditional
              summer touring roads instead and then as a result be 'vnreadie to serve her

                Forasmuch (right honourable) our company is great and thereby our charge intolerable
                in travelling the country, and the continuance thereof will be a means to bring us
                to division and separation, whereby we shall not only be undone but also unready to

            <p> Alan Nelson has identified sixteen of these watermen in Southwark parish records and
              the seventeenth in court of Exchequer documents. William 'Tuchenner,' or Tutchener,
              was buried in the parish church of St Saviour's, Southwark, on 6 January 1590/1, while
              James Grainger was buried at the end of the same year on 6 December 1591. The exact
              reason for the temporary restraint of playing, which seems to have been specific to
              the Rose, remains unclear. The letter to the <rs

            <p> The 'tediousnes of the waie' to Newington Butts has been much commented on. The old
              playhouse, dating back to 1576, was about a mile's walk from Bankside and so less
              conveniently placed for London playgoers taking the boat or London Bridge to
              Southwark. The fact that 'of longe tyme plaies haue not there bene vsed on working
              daies' is worth noting. The leaseholder of the Newington property by this time was <rs

              probably did later in the summer of 1594. Whether others paid for occasional use after
              1587 when the Rose was opened on Bankside remains an open question. </p>

              <ab> Whereas not long since, upon some considerations we did restrain the Lord Strange
                his servants from playing at the Rose on the Bankside, and enjoined them to play
                three days at Newington Butts, now forasmuch as we are satisfied that by reason of
                the tediousness of the way, and that of long time plays have not there been used on
                working days, and for that a number of poor watermen are thereby relieved, you shall

              <ab> My humble duty remembered to your good lordship. Being informed of a great
                disorder and tumult like to grow yesternight about eight of the clock within the
                borough of Southwark, I went thither with all speed I could, taking with me one of
                the sheriffs, where I found great multitudes of people assembled together and the
                principal actors to be certain servants of the Feltmakers, gathered together out of
                Bermondsey Street and the Blackfriars with a great number of loose and masterless
                men apt for such purposes. Whereupon, having made proclamation and dismissed the
                multitude, I apprehended the chief doers and authors of the disorder and have
                committed them to prison, to be farther punished as they shall be found to deserve.
                And having this morning sent for the deputy and constable of the borough with
                diverse others of best credit who were there present, to examine the cause and
                manner of the disorder, I found that it began upon the serving of a warrant from my
                lord chamberlain by one of the knight marshal’s men upon a feltmaker’s servant, who
                was committed to Marshalsea with certain others that were accused to his lordship by
                the said knight marshal’s men, without cause of offence, as themselves do affirm.
                For rescuing of whom the said companies assembled themselves by occasion and
                pretence of their meeting at a play, which besides the breach of the sabbath day,
                gives opportunity of committing these and like such disorders. The principal doers
                in this rude tumult I mean to punish to the example of others, wherein also it may
                please your lordship to give me your direction, if you shall advise upon anything
                meet to be done for farther punishment of the said offenders. Hereof I thought good
                to advertise your lordship (which I am informed by the inhabitants of Southwark, men
                of best reputation among them) that the knight marshal’s men in the serving of their
                warrants do not use themselves with that good discretion and moderate usage as were
                meet to be done in like cases, but after a most rough and violent manner, provoking
                men by such hard dealings to contend with them which would otherwise obey in a
                dutiful sort. As I understand they did in this case, where they entered the house
                where the warrant was to be served with a dagger drawn, affrighting the goodwife who
                sat by the fire with a young infant in her arms, and afterwards, having taken the
                prisoners and committing them to the Marshalsea (where they lay 5 days without
                making their answer), these mutinous persons assembling themselves in this
                disordered manner, the knight marshal’s men being within the Marshalsea, issued
                forth with their daggers drawn and bastinadoes in their hands, beating the people
                (whereof some passed that way by chance, some came but to gaze as the manner is) and
                afterwards drew their swords, whereby the tumult was more incensed and themselves
                endangered, but help came to prevent further mischief. The said inhabitants of
                Southwark do farther complain that the said knight marshal’s men behave themselves
                very unneighbourly and disdainfully among them, refusing to pay scot or lot with
                them or any other duties to church or commonwealth, which makes the inhabitants the
                more to dislike them. This much I thought good to signify to your lordship, that (if
                your lordship think good), they may be admonished of their behaviour, and to use
                more discretion in serving their warrants, for that, such tumults being once raised
                by disordered multitudes, are rather to be quenched and suppressed by policy for the
                present time than farther to be kindled by such violent means. And thus I commit
                your good lordship to the grace of the almighty. From London the 12<hi

              <ab>A letter to the master of the Rolls, Sir Owen Hopton, knight, John Barnes, and
                Richard Yonge, esquires. Whereas her majesty is informed that certain young
                apprentices and other idle people, their adherents that were authors and partakers
                of the late mutinous and foul disorder in Southwark, in most outrageous and
                tumultous sort have a further purpose and meaning in Midsummer evening or Midsummer
                night or about that time, to renew their lewd assembly together by colour of the
                time for some bad and mischievous intention, to the disturbance and breach of her
                majesty’s peace, and committing some outrages, to prevent in time these wicked and
                mischievous purposes, we have given straight order to the mayor of London for the
                city and the liberties therein belonging and to all other places near to the same to
                have regard hereunto. And so likewise we are in her majesty’s name straightly to
                charge and command you presently upon sight hereof to send for the constables and
                some of the chiefest and discreetest inhabitants in Holborn, Clerkenwell, St
                Giles-in-the-Fields, etc, and other places near thereabouts, and to charge and
                command them to take order that there may be a strong and substantial watch kept
                both on Midsummer evening, Midsummer night, and Sunday at night, of householders and
                masters of families, to continue from the beginning of the evening until the
                morning, and that all masters of servants and of apprentices be straightly charged,
                as they will answer to the contrary at their perils to keep their servants in their
                houses for those two nights, so as they may be within the doors before the evenings
                and not suffered to come forth, nor to have any weapons if they should be so lewdly
                disposed to execute any evil purpose, and if notwithstanding this straight charge
                and commandment any servants, apprentices, or other suspected persons shall be found
                in the streets, to see them presently committed to prison. Especially you shall take
                order that these watches of householders may be of that strength with their weapons
                as they may be able if there be any uproar, tumult, or unlawful assemblies in those
                quarters, it is thought meet you shall take order that there be no plays used in any
                place near thereabouts, as the Theatre, Curtain, or other usual places there where
                the same are commonly used, nor no other sort of unlawful or forbidden pastimes that
                draw together the baser sort of people, from henceforth until the feast of St
                Michael. Herein we are to require you yourselves to call to you the head constables
                and other officers and such principal men as dwell in those quarters, and to take
                some extraordinary pains to see these orders straightly observed and all other
                things effectually performed that may tend and be necessary for the preservation of
                the peace, avoiding of tumult, and suppressing of such disorder as may happen or be
                any way intended, and to join and assist such officers of the city as shall keep
                watch near unto you.<lb/>

              <ab> A letter to the lord mayor and aldermen of the city of London. Forasmuch as by
                the certificate of the last week it appears the infection does increase, which by
                the favour of God, and with your diligent observance of her majesty’s commandments
                to the means and orders prescribed to be put in execution within the city of London,
                may speedily cease. Yet for the better furtherance thereof we think it fit that all
                manner of concourse and public meetings of the people at plays, bearbaitings,
                bowlings, and other like assemblies for sports be forbidden, and therefore do hereby
                require you in her majesty’s name, straightly charge and command you forthwith to
                inhibit within your jurisdiction all plays, baiting of bears, bulls, bowling, and
                other like occasions to assemble numbers of people together (preaching and divine
                service at churches excepted), whereby no occasions be offered to increase the
                infection within the city, which you shall do both by proclamation to be published
                to that end and by special watch and observation to be had at the places where the
                plays, bearbaitings, bowlings and like pastimes are usually frequented, and if you
                shall upon this publication find any so undutiful and disobedient as they will
                notwithstanding this prohibition offer to play, bait bears or bulls, bowl, etc, you
                shall presently cause them to be apprehended and committed to prison, there to
                remain until by order they shall be dismissed. And to the end the like assemblies
                within the out liberties adjoining to the city, we have given direction to the
                justices of the peace and other public officers of the counties of Middlesex and
                Surrey, to hold the like course not only within the said liberties, but also within
                the distance of seven miles about the city, which we doubt not they will carefully
                see to be executed as you for your part within the city will do the like, in regard
                of her majesty's commandment, the benefit of the city, and for the respects already
                signified unto you.</ab>
              <ab> Two other letters of the like tenor written to the justices of the peace within
                the counties of Surrey and Middlesex for the prohibition of like assemblies in the
                out liberties and within seven miles of the city of either county. </ab>

                Whereas certain information is given that very great multitudes of all sorts of
                people do daily frequent and resort to common plays lately again set up in and about
                London, whereby it is upon good cause feared that the dangerous infection of the
                plague, by God’s great mercy and goodness well-slaked, may again very dangerously
                increase and break forth, to the great loss and prejudice of her majesty’s subjects
                in general, and especially to those of the city of whose safety and well-doing her
                highness has always had a special regard, as by the last year’s experience by like
                occasions and resort to plays it suddenly increased from a very little number to
                that greatness of mortality which ensued; we therefore thought it very expedient to
                require your Lordship forthwith to take straight order that there be no more public
                plays or interludes exercised by any company whatsoever within the compass of five
                miles distance from London, until upon better likelihood and assurance of health
                further direction may be given from us to the contrary. So we bid your lordship very
                heartily farewell. From the court at Hampton, 3 February 1593.<lb/>

                  against stage plays.</note> humble duties remembered to your good lordships and
                the rest. We have signified to your highnesses many times heretofore the great
                inconvenience which we find to grow by the common exercise of stage plays. We
                presumed to do as well in respect of the duty we bear towards her highness for the
                good government of this her city, as for conscience sake, being persuaded (under
                correction of your highnesses' judgement) that neither in polity nor in religion they
                are to be suffered in a Christian commonwealth, especially being of that frame and
                matter as they are containing nothing but profane fables, lascivious matters,
                cozening devices, and scurrilous behaviour, which are so set forth as that they move
                wholly to imitation and not to the avoiding of those faults and vices which they
                represent. Among other inconveniences it is not the least that they give opportunity
                to the refuse sort of evil-disposed and ungodly people that are within and about
                this city, to assemble themselves and to make their matches for all their lewd and
                ungodly practices, being as heretofore we have found by the examination of diverse
                apprentices and other servants who have confessed unto us that the said stage plays

              during the same summer, as some have assumed; see William Ingram, 'The Closing of the
              Theaters in 1597: A Dissenting View,' <title>Modern Philology</title> 69.2 (November
              1971), 105–15. Glynne Wickham, while subscribing to the view that the order should be
              seen in the context of the <title>Isle of Dogs</title> production, has pointed out
              that the intention of the order was essentially a restraint of public performances in
              London for three months only rather than outright suppression of all theatres. In fact
              playing resumed at the <rs ref="eats:228083" type="Place_F_Playhouse">Curtain</rs> and
              the <rs ref="eats:157260" type="Place_F_Playhouse">Rose</rs> (but not the <rs
                ref="eats:227779" type="Place_F_Playhouse">Swan</rs>) in October and November 1597.
              As he notes, the <rs ref="eats:127834" type="Collective_Troupe">Chamberlain's</rs> and
                <rs ref="eats:25827" type="Collective_Troupe">Admiral's Men</rs> were preparing for
              performances at Court during the Christmas season and both enjoyed the patronage of
              members of the <rs ref="eats:351822" type="Collective_Office">privy council</rs>, so
              rehearsing for a royal audience would have facilitated their return to those two
              public stages in the autumn. See further 'The Privy Council Order of 1597 for the
              Destruction of all London's Theatres,' <title>The Elizabethan Theatre: Papers given at

              <ab>A letter to the master of the Revels and justices of the peace of Middlesex and

                retained unto us, the Lord Admiral and Lord Chamberlain, to use and practice stage
                plays, whereby they might be better enabled and prepared to show such plays before
                her majesty as they shall be required at times meet and accustomed, to which end
                they have been chiefly licensed and tolerated, as aforesaid; and whereas there is
                also a third company of late (as we are informed) have by way of intrusion used
                likewise to play, having neither prepared any play for her majesty, nor are bound to
                you, the master of the Revels, for performing such orders as have been prescribed,
                and are enjoined to be observed by the other two companies before mentioned; we have
                therefore thought good to require you, upon receipt hereof, to take order that the
                aforesaid third company may be suppressed, and none suffered hereafter to play, but
                those two formerly named, belonging to us the Lord Admiral and Lord Chamberlain,

              more details on each, see Appendix 3 and Wiggins and Richardson, <title>British
                Drama</title>, vols 2–4. Very few of those named survive. Wiggins and Richardson's
              titles have been followed for each in the textual notes.</p>

            <p>Carson, <title>Companion</title>, pp 49–50, notes several puzzles presented by this
              document: 'Not the least of these is the identity of the author. The phrase "I have
              bought" sounds suspiciously like Henslowe, and if indeed he is the compiler of the
              list then the words probably mean no more than "have lent the actors to buy". The fact
              that one of the plays on the list <title>Vayvode</title>, belonged to <rs
                ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/153045/" type="Person_Commoner"
                >Edward Alleyn</rs> in January 1598/9 raises the possibility that he may have been
              the "I" in question' (p 49). Carson further outlines other anomalies, such as omission
              on the list of playbooks of some plays known from the diary to have been staged or
              purchased in the same period. Gurr, <title>Shakespeare's Opposites</title>, p 103,
              favours Henslowe as the compiler of the list of plays owned by the company, but with
              the exclusion of those still owned by Alleyn.</p>

            <p> John Pig (Pyg), the boy actor known to have been in the Lord Admiral's Men, 1597–9,
              was previously with <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/153197/"

              Nelson for this note and his revision of the date). Rowse, <title>Simon
              Forman</title>, p 15, dated the entry as 4 March but both Cerasano, 'Philip Henslowe,
              Simon Forman,' p 158, and Lupi&#x0107;, 'Early Performances,' p 99, n 5, misread the
              date as 9 March.</p>

            <p>However, as Lupi&#x0107; points out, the entry for 15 March 1599/1600 indicates that
              Cerasano, p 158, misdates Forman's attendance at the performance of <title>Sir John
                Oldcastle</title> in the following comment: 'On 16 October 1600, in the final
              performances of the Lord Admiral's Men at the Rose, Forman attended <title>Sir John
                Oldcastle</title>, although it is unclear whether Forman saw Part 1 or Part 2 of the
              play.' Lupi&#x0107;, p 99, points out that on '12 March Henslowe made a payment to the
              tailor for his work relating to the production of <title>The Second Part of Sir John
                Oldcastle</title>. Four days later Forman saw <title>Sir John Oldcastle</title>, and
              given the closeness of these dates the most plausible interpretation is that the play
              Forman saw was indeed the freshly mounted second part.' In any case Forman's primary
              purpose in noting the performance was to record the address of a woman he was
              interested in pursuing for other reasons.</p>

              <ab> Item, in the play of Cox of Collumpton and his three sons, Henry, Peter, and
                John, on St Mark’s Day, Cox himself shot an arrow through his uncle’s head to have
                his land, and had it. And the same day seven years on, Mr Jarvis shot Cox through
                the head and slew him. And on St Mark’s Day a year after, his elder son Henry was
                drowned by Peter and John in his tan vat. And on St Mark’s Day a year after, Peter
                and John both slew themselves for Peter being fronted with the sight of a bear, viz,
                a sprite appearing to John and him when they sat upon division of the lands in
                likeness of a bear, and therewith Peter fell out of his wits and was lied in a dark
                house and beat out his brains against a post, and John stabbed himself, and all on
                St Mark’s Day. And remember how Mr Hammon’s son slew him, and when he was slaying of
                his father, his father entreating him for mercy too, his son could find no mercy.
                Whereupon he promised that his son should bewray himself by laughing, and so he did
                and was executed for it, 1600, 4 of March at the Rose.</ab>

                occasion of some complaints that of late have been made unto us of the multitude of

                great abuses and disorders grown by the overmuch haunt and resort of many licentious
                people unto those houses and places, we have entered into consideration of some fit
                course to be taken for redress of the said disorders by suppressing diverse of those
                houses and by some restraint of the immoderate use of the plays. For which cause we
                have set down certain orders to be duly henceforth observed and kept, a copy whereof
                we send you here enclosed, and have sent the like to the lord mayor of London and to

                of the manifold abuses and disorders that have grown up and do continue by occasion
                of many houses erected and employed in and about the city of London for common stage
                plays, and now very lately by reason of some complaint exhibited by sundry persons
                against the building of the like house in or near Golding Lane <del>bouglane</del>,
                by one Edward Alleyn, a servant of the right honourable the lord admiral, the matter
                as well in general touching all the said houses for stage plays and the use of
                playing as in particular concerning the said lane, has been brought into question
                and consultation among their lordships. Forasmuch as it is manifestly known and
                granted that the multitude of the said houses, and the misgovernment of them, has
                been and is daily occasion of the idle, riotous, and dissolute living of great
                numbers of people, that leaving all such honest and painful course of life as they
                should follow, do meet and assemble there, and of the many particular abuses and
                disorders that do thereupon ensue, and yet nevertheless it is considered that the
                use and exercise of such plays (not being evil in itself) may with a good order and
                moderation be suffered in a well-governed state, and that her majesty, being pleased
                at some times to take delight and recreation in the sight and hearing of them, some
                order is fit to be taken for the allowance and maintenance of such persons as are
                thought meetest in that kind to yield her majesty recreation and delight, and
                consequently of the houses that must serve for public playing to keep them in
                exercise. To the end therefore that both the greatest abuses of the plays and
                playing houses may be redressed, and yet the aforesaid use and moderation of them
                retained, the lords and the rest of her majesty’s privy council, with one and full
                consent have ordered in manner and form as follows.<lb/> First, that there shall be
                about the city two houses and no more, allowed to serve for the use of the common
                stage plays, of the which houses one shall be in Surrey, in that place which is
                commonly called the Bankside, or thereabouts, and the other in Middlesex. And
                forasmuch as their lordships have been enformed by Edmund Tilney, esquire, that the
                house now in hand to be built by the said Edward Alleyn is not intended to increase

                  altercation and interlying of this order was by reason that the said order after
                  the same was entered in the book came again in question and debate, and the said
                  interlining and amendents were set down according to the last determination of
                  their lordships. <handShift/><seg type="signed">Thomas Smith</seg></note> (namely
                the Curtain) which is either to be ruined and plucked down, or to be put to some
                other good use, as also that the situation thereof is meet and convenient for that
                purpose, it is likewise ordered that the said house of Alleyn shall be allowed to be
                one of the two houses, and namely for the house to be allowed in Middlesex for the
                company of players belonging to the lord admiral so as the house called the Curtain
                be (as it is <del rend="overstrike">has been</del> pretended) either ruinated or
                applied to some other good use, and for the other house allowed to be on Surrey
                side, whereas their lordships are pleased to permit to the company of players that
                shall play there to make their own choice which they will have of diverse houses
                that are there, choosing one of them and no more</ab>
              <ab>And the said company of players, being the servants of the lord chamberlain, that
                are to play there have made choice of the house called the Globe, it is ordered that
                the said house and none other shall be there allowed. And especially it is forbidden
                that any stage plays shall be played (as sometimes they have been) in any common inn
                for public assembly, in or near about the city.</ab>
              <ab>Secondly, forasmuch as these stage plays, by the multitude of house and company of
                players have been so frequent not serving for recreation, but inviting and calling
                the people daily from their trade and work to misspend their time, | it is likewise
                ordered that the two several companies of players assigned unto the two houses
                allowed may play each of them in their several houses twice a week and no oftener,
                and especially that they shall refrain to play on the sabbath day, upon pain of
                imprisonment and further penalty, and that they shall forbear altogether in the time
                of Lent and likewise at such time and times as any extraordinary sickness or
                infection of disease shall appear to be in or about the city.</ab>
              <ab>Thirdly, because the orders will be of little force and effect unless they be duly
                put in execution by those unto whom it appertains to see them executed, it is
                ordered that several copies of these orders shall be sent to the lord mayor of
                London and to the justices of the peace of the counties of Middlesex and Surrey, and
                that letters shall be written unto them from the lordships, straightly charging them
                to see to the execution of the same, as well by committing to prison any owners of
                playhouses and players as shall disobey and resist these orders, as by any other
                good and lawful means that in their discretion they shall find expedient, and to
                certify their lordships from time to time as they shall see cause of their
                proceedings herein. </ab>

                <lb/> After our hearty commendations. Whereas her majesty (having been well pleased
                heretofore at times of recreation with the services of Edward Alleyn and his
                company, servants to me, the earl of Nottingham, whereof of late he has made
                discontinuance) has sundry times signified her pleasure, that he should revive the
                same again: forasmuch as he has bestowed a great sum of money, not only for the
                title of a plot of ground, situated in a very remote and exempt place near Golding
                Lane, there to erect a new house, but also is in good forwardness about the frame
                and workmanship thereof. The convenience of which place for that purpose is
                testified unto us under the hands of many of the inhabitants of the liberty of
                Finsbury, where it is, and recommended by some of the justices themselves. We
                therefore having informed her majesty likewise of the decay of the house wherein
                this company lately played, situate upon the Bank, very
                noisome<!--PG to add gloss: I guess ‘noisesome: var of noisome’ needs
                to be added to the glossary and the 2 occurrences in the rose tagged-->
                for the resort of people in the winter time, have received order to require you to
                tolerate the proceeding of the said new house near Golding Lane, and do hereby
                require you and every of you to permit and suffer the said Edward Alleyn to proceed
                in the effecting and finishing of the same new house, without any your let or
                interruption towards him or any of his workmen, the rather because an other house is
                pulled down instead of it. And so not doubting of your conformity herein, we commit
                you to God. From the court at Richmond, the 8th of April 1600.</ab>

                give order for redress if our directions find no better execution and observation
                than it seems they do. And we must need impute the fault and blame thereof to you or
                some of you, the justices of the peace that are put in trust to see them executed
                and performed, whereof we may give you a plain instance in the great abuse continued
                – or rather increased – in the multitude of playhouses and stage plays in and about
                the city of London. For whereas about a year and half since (upon knowledge taken of
                the great enormities and disorders by the overmuch frequenting of plays) we did
                carefully set down and prescribe an order to be observed concerning the number of
                playhouses, and the use and exercise of the same (namely that there should be but
                two houses allowed for that use, one in Middlesex called the Fortune, and the other
                in Surrey called the Globe, and the same with observation of certain days and times
                as in the said order is particularly expressed) in such sort as a moderate practice
                of them for honest recreation might be continued and yet the inordinate concourse of
                dissolute and idle people be restrained, we do now understand that our said order
                has been so far from taking due effect, as instead of restraint and redress of the
                former disorders, the multitude of playhouses is much increased, and that no day
                passes over without many stage plays in one place or other within and about the city
                publicly made. The default of performance of which our said order<note type="foot"
                  subtype="modernization">The ... order: <hi rend="italic">made
                mention?</hi></note>, we must in great part the rather impute to the justices of the
                peace, because at the same time we gave earnest direction unto you to see it
                straightly executed, and to certify us of the execution, and yet we have neither
                understood of any redress made by you, nor received any certificate at all of your
                proceedings therein, which default or omission we do now pray and require you
                forthwith to amend, and to cause our said former order to be put duly into
                execution, and especially to call before you the owners of all the other playhouses
                (excepting the two houses in Middlesex and Surrey aforementioned), and to take good
                and sufficient bonds of them, not to exercise, use, or practice, nor to suffer from
                henceforth to be exercised, used, or practiced, any stage playing in their houses,
                and if they shall refuse to enter into such bonds, then to commit them to prison,
                until they shall conform themselves. And so, etc.<lb/>

                  dated as the former.</note> letter to the lord mayor and aldermen of London. We
                have received a letter from you, renewing a complaint of the great abuse and
                disorder within and about the city of London, by reason of the multitude of
                playhouses and the inordinate resort and concourse of dissolute and idle people
                daily unto public stage plays, for the which information we do commend your
                lordship, because it betokens your care and desire to reform the disorders of the
                city. So we must let you know that we did much rather expect to understand that our
                order (set down and prescribed about a year and a half since for reformation of the
                said disorders upon the like complaint at that time) had been duly executed, then to
                find the same disorders and abuses so much increased as they are, the blame whereof,
                as we cannot but impute in great part to the justices of the peace, or some of them
                in the counties of Middlesex and Surrey, who had special direction and charge from
                us to see our said order executed for the confines of the city wherein the most part
                of those playhouses are situated. So we do wish that it might appear unto us that
                any thing has been endeavoured by the precedessors of you, the lord mayor, and by
                you, the aldermen, for the redress of the said enormities, and for observation and
                execution of our said order with the city. We do therefore once again renew hereby
                our directions unto you (as we have done by our letters to the justices of Middlesex
                and Surrey) concerning the observation of our former order, which we do pray and
                require you to cause duly and diligently to be put in execution for all points
                thereof, and especially for the express and straight prohibition of any more
                playhouses than those two that are mentioned and allowed in the said order, charging
                and straightly commanding all such persons as are the owners of the houses used for
                stage plays within the city not to permit any more public plays to be used,
                exercised, or shown from henceforth in their said houses, and to take bonds of them
                (if you shall find it needful) for the performance thereof, or if they shall refuse
                to enter into bond or to observe our said order, then to commit them to prison until
                they shall conform themselves thereunto. And so praying you as yourself do make the
                complaint and find the enormity, so to apply your best endeavours to the remedy of
                the abuse, we bid etc. </ab>

        <div>
          <p><rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/126857/" type="Person_Commoner"
              >Thomasyn Symonds</rs>, of <rs ref="eats:225746" type="Place_PA_Settlement">St Mildred's Bread Street</rs> in London, had inherited the
            freehold of the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/231675/"
              type="Place_F_Property">Little Rose</rs> property on Bankside upon the death of her
            husband, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/126979/"
              type="Person_Commoner">Ralph Symonds</rs>, fishmonger, and it seems clear that she
            intended to bequeath the property in perpetuity to the charitable uses of her parish.
            But an ancient statute, the Statute of Mortmain,<note type="foot">Properly called the
              statute 'de Religiosis,' enacted by Edward I’s parliament in 1279. See Great Britain,
                <title>The Statutes of the Realm</title>, vol 1 (London, 1810; rpt 1963), 51.</note>
            erected barriers to such an intention. If one wished to leave property to the church –
            and leaving it to a parish meant leaving it to the church – one could not do that
            directly because the Statute of Mortmain prohibited it.</p>
          <p>'Mortmain' is the term commonly used to describe property held in perpetuity by any
            entity, but most commonly by the church. Because the entity never dies such property is
            exempt from inheritance, with its attendant taxes and death duties. Property held in
            mortmain thus represented a lost revenue stream to the Crown, and Edward I hoped to end
            the practice with his statute. But his statute addressed only church property, and
            clever persons soon realized that property could be held in perpetuity by trustees, or
              feoffees,<note type="foot">Feoffee: A person invested with a freehold estate in land,
              that is, with a fief or fee, the freehold estate conveyed by livery of seisin.</note>
            as easily as by the church.<note type="foot"> This was, or was perceived to be, a fairly
              large concern. According to the anonymous eighteenth century author of a letter to
              William Pitt, 'one third of the land of this kingdom is vested in mortmain'
                (<title>Three Letters to the Right Hon. Wm. Pitt, on the Subject of the Statutes of
                Mortmain: Containing an Enquiry into the Origin and Present State of the Possessions
                of the Clergy under that Tenure</title> (London, 1795), 2).</note></p>
          <p>So on 3 December 1552 Thomasyn Symonds conveyed to eighteen named persons, whom she
            described in the deed of transfer as her 'feoffees,' the 'mesuage or ten<ex>emen</ex>t
            called the little Roose with two gardeyns to the same adioyning.' The property was
            devised to 'my said feoffes aforenamed &amp; their heires foreu<ex>er</ex>.' And on 22
            December 1552, only three weeks after the enrolling of this deed of gift, Thomasyn’s
            attorney <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/205304/"
              type="Person_Commoner">Peter Baker</rs> affirmed that he had taken 'full &amp;
            peaseble possession state &amp; season' of the Little Rose property and that he 'did
            giue &amp; deliu<ex>er</ex> the same peasible possession state &amp; season to theise
              p<ex>er</ex>sons hereafter named being the most p<ex>ar</ex>t of the feoffes' named in
            the deed.<note type="foot"> Baker’s affidavit is enrolled with the deed; see TNA: C.54/482,
              mb 13.</note></p>
          <p>The documents tell us that some of the feoffees, perhaps the bulk of them, were
            parishioners of St Mildred's, some of them perhaps churchwardens. But the records of the
            parish do not survive from before the middle of the seventeenth century, so there is no
            way to resolve this issue. All we know is that these eighteen men were charged to use
            the income from the property to perform certain charitable acts. Should those charitable
            acts align with the desires of the parish of St Mildred, so much the better.</p>
          <p>The feoffees’ initial use of the Little Rose property was to lease it to tenants and
            collect the rent. In 1574 the feoffees leased the property for thirty-one years (or
            until 1605) to <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/129508/"
              type="Person_Commoner">William Griffen</rs>, for £7 per year, and Griffen soon sold
            the lease to <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/126687/"
              type="Person_Commoner">Robert Withens</rs>, who in turn sold the lease, in 1584/5, to
              <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/129736/" type="Person_Commoner"
              >Philip Henslowe</rs>, who – with twenty years left on the lease – built <rs
              ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/157260/" type="Place_F_Playhouse"> a
              playhouse</rs> on the property, and continued to pay the annual rent of £7 per year.
            It seemed clear to Henslowe that the rent he paid went to the parish of St Mildred,
            though he must have paid it to the feoffees or their agents as specified in the
              deed.<note type="foot"> 'Pd vnto St mildred<ex>es</ex> – vij li': Foakes and Rickert,
                <title>Henslowe’s Diary</title>, p 246. </note> Such blurring of the presumed and
            the actual was perhaps not uncommon in the period. When the lease expired in 1605,
            Henslowe declined to renew it, perhaps because the new rent would rise to £20 per year,
            plus 100 marks for upkeep.<note type="foot">A '<rs
                ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/199666/" type="Person_Commoner">Mr
                Pope</rs>' told Henslowe, at a scrivener’s shop in 1603, about the new £20 rent,
              showing him 'a wrytynge betwext the pareshe and hime.' Such a writing indicates the
              parish’s role, and suggests that this Mr Pope may have been one of the successor
              feoffees.</note></p>
          <p>The Little Rose reverted to the feoffees, who did not immediately find another person
            wishing to lease the property. In 1606 the presentment jurors of the Surrey and Kent
            Commissions of Sewers – who had regularly fined Henslowe for non-maintenance of the
            sewer in front of the Rose playhouse – reported to the commission at its session on 14
            February and again on 26 April that 'Edward Box of Bredstreete in London' – perhaps the
            son, and therefore the 'heir' ('&amp; their heires foreu<ex>er</ex>') of <rs
              ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/127168/">William Box</rs>, one of
            the original feoffees from a half century earlier – was now the person charged with
            repairing 'the sewar by the Late Playhouse in Maidelane called the Rose.' Box, like
            Henslowe before him, failed to make the repairs and on 27 October 1606 he too was
              fined.<note type="foot"> LMA, SKCS 18, ff 436, 441.</note></p>

                <p>The meaning of ‘highnoyous’ is not entirely clear, though the bequest for 'the
                  reparacions of highnoyous wayes abowte London' and its repetition further down as
                  'amending of highnoyous wayes' suggests that 'highnoyous wayes' should be
                  understood as one phrase, and that highways were intended. Bequests for mending of
                  highways were not uncommon in the period; see, for example, the section on
                  ‘Charitable Donations to Infrastructure’ in Susan E. James, <title>Women’s Voices
                    in Tudor Wills, 1485–1603: Authority, Influence and Material Culture</title>
                  (London and New York, 2016), 55–8, or B. Kirkman Gray, <title>A History of English
                    Philanthropy, from the Dissolution of the Monasteries to the Taking of the First
                    Census</title> (London, 1905), 20–1, for numerous instances. The vestry of the
                  parish of St Saviour appointed each year two of its members to be surveyors of
                  highways, and collections were taken regularly for mending and repairing the
                  highways of the parish. Shakespeare knew it happened; in <title>The Merchant of
                    Venice</title>, Graziano says ‘Why, this is like the mending of highways / In
                  summer where the ways are fair enough!’ (<title>The Oxford Shakespeare: The
                    Complete Works</title>, Stanley Wells <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> (eds), 2nd ed
                  (Oxford, 2005), 5.1.263–4). But the word is peculiar and its repetition in the
                  will suggests it was not a scribal error.</p>

                    and women within the said parish, then I will that my said executors shall

                    and doth owe unto me the sum of &#x00A3;40 of lawful money of England, I now
                    do bequeath to either of John Ashhurst and William Ashhurst his sons, &#x00A3;10, 
                    sum &#x00A3;20, being the moiety of the said sum of &#x00A3;40, so
                    that the said William Ashhurst within two months next after my decease shall be
                    bound by obligation sufficient in the law to my executors for the sure payment
                    of the said sum of &#x00A3;20 to his said sons, when they shall accomplish
                    their lawful ages of 21 years. Item, I bequeath to either of the said John Gee

          <p>This inventory of <rs ref="eats:40453" type="Drama_Type">plays</rs> associated with the <rs ref="eats:157260" type="Place_F_Playhouse">Rose Playhouse</rs> includes several at the end
            listed as only possibly performed there. Wiggins and Richardson's annotated catalogue
              <title>British Drama 1533–1642</title>, vols 2–4, serves as authority for the title,
            authors, troupes, genre and status listed below. Further details of date, plot, roles,
            staging, sources, performance history, and more for each play are provided – as far as
            possible – in that source, according to a numbering system provided here, by volume. See
            also Wiggins' 'Introduction,' vol 1, for the scope and limitations, content, format and
            arrangement of the catalogue.</p>

          <p>Others have published their own inventories of plays performed at the Rose, with
            predictable variations in the titles and in their interpretation of Henslowe's diary
            records. See for example, Chambers, <title>Elizabethan Stage</title>, vol 2, pp 118–27,
            143–7, 165–71, Rhodes, 'Appendix A,' <title>Henslowe’s Rose</title>, pp 185–223, and
            Scott McMillin, who narrows his focus to published and manuscript plays that can be
            securely identified with the Rose, <title>The Elizabethan Theatre and <title>The Book of
                Sir Thomas More</title></title> (Ithaca and London, 1987), 115–24. For the Admiral's
            Men in particular, see Andrew Gurr, who accounts for 158 plays at the Rose in total,
            with twenty–four surviving in print and two in manuscript, 'Appendix 1,'
              <title>Shakespeare's Opposites</title>, pp 201–53, and Roslyn Knutson, 'Commercial
            Significance,' 'Appendix I: Plays in <title>Henslowe's Diary</title> Eligible for
            Production, 1597–1603,' pp 134–47.</p>

          <p>The sheer number of lost plays listed below reveals how difficult it is to assess any
            individual company preferences for tragedies and histories over, for example, comedies,
