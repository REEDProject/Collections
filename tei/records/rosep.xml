      <projectDesc>
        <p>Records of Early English Drama (REED) is an international scholarly project that is
          establishing for the first time the context from which the drama of Shakespeare and his
          contemporaries grew. Founded in 1976, REED has worked since then to locate, transcribe,
          and edit historical documents containing evidence of drama, secular music, and other
          communal entertainment and ceremony from the Middle Ages until 1642, when the Puritans
          closed the London theatres.</p>

          <p>The goal of this collection of Rose Playhouse records is to offer a prototype for a
            series of digital editions of London area renaissance and Jacobean playhouses now
            proposed for the <title>REED Online</title> series. The hope is to stimulate interest in
            the use of individual playhouse collections linked with GIS mapping and manuscript
            images in the classroom as well as the study. The Rose records have been chosen first as
            a small but representative sample that can now be viewed for comment and further
            development. It should be noted that Henslowe's Diary has not been re-edited for
            inclusion here, for obvious reasons. Not only is R.A. Foakes' authoritative edition
            widely available but Grace Ioppolo intends to upload a digital version of the Diary on
            the <ref target="https://henslowe-alleyn.org.uk/"><title>Henslowe-Alleyn Digitisation
                Project</title></ref> in future. The Records and editorial apparatus have been fully
            checked by REED's editorial team but have not yet been circulated for external
            assessment so constructive feedback from our users will be welcome (please contact:
            s.maclean@utoronto.ca).</p>

          <p>As editor of this collection, I have delighted in the support and expertise of several
            members of the REED editorial team. First and foremost, our project manager, Carolyn
            Black, who has efficiently co-ordinated work on the Rose while simultaneously bringing
            the more extensive edition of <ref target="https://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/collections/hamps/"><title>Hampshire</title></ref>, edited by Peter Greenfield and the late Jane Cowling,
            to publication. I am grateful also to REED's associate editor and paleographer, Patrick
            Gregory, who checked all transcriptions and contributed the English Glossary; to Illya Nokhrin, 
            who assisted in content checking the editorial apparatus and tagged all entities for searching 
            across the collection with resourcefulness and patient attention to every detail; and to Stephanie Hovland, REED's research
            associate in England, who assisted in on-site work at an earlier stage of research.
            Tanya Hagen, REED's bibliographer and now associate editor, has been an invaluable
            companion along the way, first as our research paths converged while she edited the Rose
            bibliographic data for the <ref target="https://emlot.library.utoronto.ca/"><title>Early
                Modern London Theatres</title></ref> website and lately as bibliographic support and
            copy-editor of the completed collection. The Rose, like other REED digital editions, would not appear on our screens without the 
            expertise and advice of our programmer, Jamie Norrish, who has incorporated manuscript 
            images to complement transcriptions for the first time. My long-time collaborator, 
            Byron Moldofsky, deserves special mention for his cartographic skills and ongoing 
            interest in developing a more ambitious project to map not only the Southwark 
            area in historic detail but also the wider London area for more collections to come. 
            It has not been possible at this time to include the detailed map for Southwark 
            with a timeline feature, as hoped, but Byron's demo version will be available as an 
            'online resource' on REED's information website, <ref target="https://reed.utoronto.ca">https://reed.utoronto.ca</ref>.</p>

          <p>The inclusion of manuscript digital images has been made possible through friendly
            permissions granted by the following archives: The National Archives and the London
            Metropolitan Archives (City of London). My thanks to Paul Johnson (TNA) and Laurence
            Ward (LMA) for responding to my requests. I am also grateful for help with permission to
            publish transcriptions from Wendy Hawke at LMA and from the Trust for London for the
            1650 lease of the Little Rose Estate. My special thanks go to Calista Lucy, Keeper of
            the Archives at Dulwich College, and to Grace Ioppolo, Director of the <title>Henslowe-Alleyn Digitisation
                Project</title>, who granted permission to link my transcriptions to the
            professional images on the open access <title>Henslowe-Alleyn</title> website.</p>

          <p>My visits to Dulwich College for work on the wonderful archive collection there were
            made memorable by Calista's hospitality and I look forward to continuing collaboration
            with Grace, whose support for both the Rose and my forthcoming collection for the Bear
            Garden/Hope with Stephanie Hovland has been warmly appreciated.</p>

          <p>On a personal note, I have treasured the friendship and shared interests of Bill Ingram
            and Alan Nelson, whose generous work on the parish records of St Saviour's Southwark

          <p>The property known as the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/231675/" type="Place_F_Property">Rose</rs> was situated on the south bank of the Thames in the liberty of the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/223826/" type="Place_PA_Liberty">Clink</rs>, located to the west of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/229053/" type="Place_F_Bridge">London

            eighteenth century, so its presence there was key to the development of Southwark as a
            zone of hospitality for travellers, notably Chaucer's pilgrims to <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/74508/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Canterbury</rs>.<note type="foot">See further Martha Carlin, <title>Medieval

            At the outset the greater part of the bishop's manor comprised marshy fields, meadows,
            and pastures. At the northeast corner of the estate, the bishop and his successors
            built a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/231865/" type="Place_F_Residence">palace</rs> to serve as their London area residence: the great hall's west end wall with the stone tracery of its fine rose window remains standing on the south side of

          <p>The property called <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/231694/" type="Place_F_Property">the Rose</rs> stretched from Bankside to Maid Lane and was owned
            by <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/199129/" type="Person_Commoner">William Spence</rs>, a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/127051/" type="Collective_Occupation">fishmonger</rs> of London, in the early years of the
            sixteenth century.<note type="foot">In June 1537 Spence, then of Great Palgrave,
              Norfolk, but previously citizen and stockfishmonger of London, sold the Great Rose to

              326/12364.</note> By this time the Little Rose had been segregated from the 'Great
            Rose,' so its subsequent history evolves under different ownership. However, the deed
            drawn up for Spence's sale of the Great Rose names a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/126979/" type="Person_Commoner">Ralph Symonds</rs> as owner of the property just east of the Great
            Rose. This refers to the smaller section of the Little Rose which fronted on the Thames;

              (London, 1908), 26.</note> By 1552 she determined to make a charitable bequest of the
            Little Rose property in perpetuity following her death. Income from its rents would
            contribute to support of the poor from her parish, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/225746/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">St Mildred’s Bread Street</rs> London, and from <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/227171/" type="Place_F_Hospital">Christ's Hospital</rs>, as well as needy fishermen in <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/229376/" type="Place_F_Street">Old
              Fish Street</rs>. The deed, dated 3 December 1552, names as trustees or feoffees two gentlemen
            from <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/2039/" type="Place_County">Kent</rs> as well as sixteen others, very likely from St Mildred's parish. From Thomasyn's
            death in 1555 onward, the trust seems to have been managed by representatives from the
            parish. The description of the estate in the deed indicates that some urban development
            had occurred: 'all that my mesuage or ten<ex>emen</ex>t called the little Roose with two

            marshy land along Bankside had been used in recent centuries for breeding freshwater
            fish, especially pike, in ponds maintained by London fishmongers like Ralph Symonds.</p>
          <p>On 20 November 1574 six of eight named parishioners of St Mildred's Bread Street signed
            a thirty-one year lease for the Little Rose 'messuage or Tenement' with <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/129508/" type="Person_Commoner">William Griffen</rs> , a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/73720/" type="Collective_Occupation">vintner</rs> of London. An annual rent of £7 would be due in quarterly instalments, with Griffen (or
            his sub-tenants) responsible for repairs and maintenance of the property.<note type="foot">For a transcript of the lease (DC: Mun 8), see <ptr target="#rosep-ridm124316664"/>.</note> Five years later, on 11 December 1579,

          <p>By this time there were several pictorial representations of Bankside and its terrain.

            the south bank of the Thames from the city of London's perspective in a mid-eighteenth
            century copy made of a mural, subsequently lost, of the 1547 coronation progress of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/23984/" type="Person_Royalty">

            beyond.</p>
          <p>Early modern mapping of London was sporadic, mostly derivative, and pictorial – not
            true cartography until 1676.<note type="foot">The first true cartography was done by

          <p>Just a sampling of the more extensive fish
            ponds, or 'pike gardens,' south of the bank is represented and there are no theatres in
            view, a sure clue that the Agas map was based on an earlier, pre-1576 version of London.
            By the mid-sixteenth century, however, there is documentary evidence to support the
            existence of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/21767/" type="Entertainment_AnimalSport">bearbaiting</rs> arenas in Southwark and these are
            suggested in the two circular arenas just south of the bank, one titled 'The bolle
            bayting' and the other, to the east, 'The Bearebayting.' We should assume considerable
            artistic licence here. The precise locations of the arenas remain in question, but the
            views available suggest that when Withens took over the lease, the Little Rose estate
            consisted of very few buildings along the river with two as yet undeveloped 'gardens'
            stretching behind.</p>
          <p>Just over six years later Robert Withens sold the remainder of the Little Rose lease to
              <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/129736/" type="Person_Commoner">Philip Henslowe</rs>, by then a resident of Bankside.<note type="foot">Henslowe first

            retained the annual rental rate of £7, with no indication of the sale price.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#rosep-ridm90656952"/>.</note></p>
          <p>The next document of interest relating to the Little Rose has deeper significance for
            the history of London theatre. On 10 January 1586/7 Henslowe signed a deed of
            partnership with a London <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/127233/" type="Collective_Occupation">grocer</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/130879/" type="Person_Commoner">John
              Cholmley</rs>.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#rosep-ridm90584488"/>.</note> Their
            joint venture was, in fact, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/157260/" type="Place_F_Playhouse">the
              first playhouse</rs> to be built in Southwark, on the Little Rose property recently
            leased by Henslowe. The basic dimensions of the property are described as approximately
            ninety-four feet square. By the time the deed was being drawn up, the playhouse was 'now
            in framinge and shortly to be ereckted.' It seems likely that Henslowe, an entrepreneur
            just beginning to make his mark in Southwark, conceived of the plan and made a start to
            raise a playhouse, with the help of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/131126/" type="Person_Commoner">John

              surviving sporadically between 1571 and 1588 do not list a John Cholmley (or variant
              surname) as a Southwark resident.</note> Although the terms of the sub-lease for this
            tenement have not been discovered, the deed of partnership makes clear that John
            Cholmley was the tenant and therefore an agreement of some sort with him would probably
            have been required in order to build the playhouse adjacent on the garden plot.</p>
          <p>The partnership agreed to between Henslowe and his tenant Cholmley was potentially
            profitable for both. As Bowsher and Cerasano summarize the terms, 'Cholmley was to pay
            Henslowe £816 in instalments over the course of eight and a quarter years but not
            starting until 25 June [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>, for 24 June], <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/41188/" type="CalendarDay_Liturgical">the feast day of St John the Baptist</rs>. This clearly
            shows that Henslowe had enough ready money to finance the bulk of construction costs
            himself. In return, Cholmley would receive a half-share in the profits of the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40453/" type="Drama_Type">plays</rs>, and have exclusive right to the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40978/" type="Thing_FoodDrink">catering</rs> and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40997/" type="Thing_FoodDrink">victualling</rs> of the enterprise run from his house.
            Moreover, both men would be allowed to admit their friends to performances without
            charging admission fees. Henslowe would finance the construction of the playhouse and
            pay all rents as of 29 September 1587, suggesting that this was the target date for the
            Rose’s opening. According to the deed, although Cholmley and Henslowe would share
            maintenance expenses of the playhouse thereafter, and throughout the period covered by
            the agreement, Henslowe appears to have financed all of the major expenses before the
            playhouse was operable.'<note type="foot"> Julian Bowsher and S.P. Cerasano, <ref target="https://henslowe-alleyn.org.uk/essays/the-deed-of-partnership-in-the-rose-playhouse-january-10-1587/">'The Deed of Partnership in the Rose Playhouse (January 10, 1587),'</ref> pp

          <p>The partnership would expire on Lady Day, 25 March 1595, but after the agreement early
            in 1587 Cholmley virtually disappears from the record. The only other mentions of
            Cholmley amongst the Henslowe-Alleyn papers after 1587 are a couple of scribbles,
            perhaps pen trials, on folio 1 of Henslowe’s diary. William Ingram has persuasively identified this shadowy

          <p>The lease of the Little Rose was soon to come due for renewal in 1605 but the new terms
            increasing the annual rent to £20 with a further 100 marks (equivalent to almost £66)
            required for building repairs were obviously unappealing. It seems most likely that
            Henslowe followed through on his threat to abandon the playhouse. Closure of the
            theatres during the plague year of 1603 and subsequently for periods during 1604 and
            1605 may have further contributed to his decision.<note type="foot">See further F.P.

            commonly termed 'diary' – really a memorandum book in which he made rough jottings about
            the theatre business (mainly 1591/2–1604), including playhouse repairs, income from <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40453/" type="Drama_Type">play

              makes a persuasive argument in favour of 'taking instead a more "holistic" approach to
              Henslowe's book, examining it as an artifact made up of all its many parts, that
              stands within a well-established tradition of memorandum books or, perhaps more

            is much indebted and linked wherever relevant. The evolution of Henslowe as an
            entrepreneur – really the dominant entrepreneur – in the development of substantial
            landholdings along the south bank of the Thames can therefore be traced through the
            archives at Dulwich College and The National Archives in Kew. There, many court records
            of the Chancery and Exchequer reveal more about his lucrative Bankside estates, which
            became the focus of lengthy acrimonious disputes following his death in 1616.</p>

          <p>Philip Henslowe came from a prosperous gentry family with some social status in the
            county of Sussex. He was the fourth of seven children born to <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/201708/" type="Person_Commoner">Edmond Henslowe</rs> (or Hensley) and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/201758/" type="Person_Commoner">Margaret Ridge</rs>, who resided near <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/234794/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Lindfield</rs>, Sussex.<note type="foot">A succinct account of Henslowe's life has

            the couple did not have any children of their own. Joan's eventual marriage to Edward
            Alleyn, the star of the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/25827/" type="Collective_Troupe">lord admiral's men</rs>, in 1592 would bring a deep and lasting
            personal and professional relationship for both men that would impact the Elizabethan
            theatre industry profoundly.</p>

          <p>Although Henslowe retained his identity as a member of the Dyers’ Company, his business
            interests ranged much more widely than the textile industry. Records are scanty for his
            activities until he commenced his acquisition of property on Bankside with the purchase
            of the lease for the Little Rose in 1584/5.<note type="foot">See <ref target="#background-property">History of the Rose Property</ref>.</note> From that
            purchase onward, Henslowe's strategic path to success in business, property development,
            and court appointments, as well as his rising social status in the parish of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/226221/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">St Saviour's Southwark</rs>, is fascinating to trace.</p>

          <p>The purchase of the Little Rose lease was surely not a random choice. As the map of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/36966/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">
              Southwark</rs> shows at a glance, the Little Rose property, adjacent on its west side
            to the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/231694/" type="Place_F_Property">Great Rose</rs>, was also only a few steps from the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/227798/" type="Place_F_Arena">Bear

              and Cock</rs> site, a little further west of the Great Rose. Documentary evidence from
            the mid-sixteenth century confirms that bearbaiting was likely the earliest form of
            popular entertainment on Bankside, apart from the notorious brothels that had lined the
            south bank of the river since at least the fourteenth century.<note type="foot">See

          <p>Some may have railed against bearbaitings at the time but, in the early 1580s, that was
            the main game on the south bank and likely a lucrative one too. Much of the audience may
            have come across the river by ferry or on foot but there was also a long string of inns
            along the high street of Southwark leading to <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/229053/" type="Place_F_Bridge">London
              Bridge</rs>, including the famous <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/228369/" type="Place_F_VictuallingHouse">Tabard</rs> where Chaucer’s pilgrims gathered before their trek to <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/74508/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Canterbury</rs>. When Henslowe arrived, the area was therefore already established
            for <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40677/" type="Entertainment_Type">rough sports</rs> with audience appeal, but there was no
            playhouse yet. The only <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/227741/" type="Place_F_Playhouse">playhouse</rs> south of the river was much further south, at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/231618/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Newington Butts</rs>, by then no longer under the management of the actor <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/202508/" type="Person_Commoner">Jerome Savage</rs>, and less conveniently located. <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/228217/" type="Place_F_Playhouse">The
              Theatre</rs> and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/228083/" type="Place_F_Playhouse">the Curtain</rs> were the only other playhouses open at this time
            but they were across the river, north of the city walls. Did Henslowe, a man with
            enterpreneurial instincts and considerable ambition, see an opportunity to expand the
            entertainment options on Bankside by building the first Southwark playhouse on the
            Little Rose site? The evidence suggests that he did.</p>

          <p>When Henslowe purchased the lease of the Little Rose, there no longer seems doubt that
            he had money of his own to invest but his marriage to Harry Woodward's widow must have
            consolidated his financial position further. Judging by the terms of the lease, there
            were already houses and shops on the property, so he could count on steady income from
            rentals for at least twenty more years, when the lease had to be renewed.<note type="foot"><ptr target="#rosep-ridm90656952"/>.</note> But he may have had more on
            his mind than rental income.</p>

          <p>Within a short space of time, he must have hired the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/39209/" type="Collective_Occupation">carpenter</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/131126/" type="Person_Commoner">John Griggs</rs>, to begin building a playhouse: by January
            1586/7, less than two years after the lease was signed, the deed of partnership with <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/130879/" type="Person_Commoner">John
              Cholmley</rs> mentions the 'playe howse now in framinge.'<note type="foot">For the
              deed of partnership see <ptr target="#rosep-ridm90584488"/>. Mary Edmond, 'The Builder
              of the Rose Theatre,' <title>Theatre Notebook</title> 44.2 (1990), 50–4, provides
              further biographical information on John Griggs, Henslowe's builder and friend.</note>
            The partnership deed itself secured the details of Cholmley's involvement in running
            concessions for the Rose while also avoiding conflict over the location of the playhouse
            near the small house at the Little Rose, for which he probably held an ongoing
            sub-lease. It is evident, however, that it was Henslowe's initial investment that
            launched the development of the Rose.</p>

          <p>The exact opening date of the Rose is not recorded but it is generally agreed to have
            been in operation by October 1587, when some of the local residents had apparently
            complained of the new arrival on the Bankside scene. A letter from the privy council to
            the Surrey justices of the peace on 29 October 1587 outlines the protest as follows:</p>

          <p>'thinhabitaunts of Southwa<damage><gap unit="chars" extent="2"/></damage> had
            complained vnto their L<ex>ordshipes</ex> declaring that thorder by their

            performed at the Rose, the only playhouse located in the Clink at that time. In fact,
            more than a decade would elapse before <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/227836/" type="Place_F_Playhouse">the
              Globe</rs> opened there on the south side of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/229091/" type="Place_F_Street">Maid
              Lane</rs>.</p>

          <p>With the opening of the Rose in 1587, Henslowe launched his role as a playhouse
            landlord in earnest. Sometime between 1587 and 1590 he attracted an acting troupe of
            notable talent to make the Rose their preferred base of operations. We can now say with
            some confidence that this company, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/153197/" type="Collective_Troupe">
              Lord Strange’s men</rs>, did not aim to pursue the provincial touring habits of their
            predecessors. Presumably they recognized the potential of the burgeoning entertainment
            market of London, even as Henslowe did, so finding a stable base for performance at the
            Rose would have been appealing.<note type="foot">See further Manley and MacLean, <title>Lord Strange's Men</title>, pp 37-63, for formation of the troupe and the apparent preference for London.</note></p>
          <p>Sometime during this same period Henslowe began expanding his network in various
            directions. By <hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1590, he had gained his first appointment at
            court. The <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/137174/" type="Collective_Occupation">watermen</rs>'s petition to the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/25845/" type="Person_Nobility">lord
              admiral</rs> is the first surviving record to refer to Henslowe as 'one of the groomes of
            her ma<ex>ies</ex>ties Chamber'.<note type="foot">For more detail on this and other
              court appointments throughout Henslowe's life, see Cerasano, 'Elizabethan Court,' p
              50.</note> Around this time he also met and established an increasingly close
            relationship with Edward Alleyn, the leading actor of the lord admiral's men. The
            precise date when Alleyn left that company to combine forces with Strange's men has not
            been established but sometime in the 1590–1 period is very plausible. The touring
            licence during the plague year issued to Strange's men by the privy council on 6 May
            1593 includes Alleyn, still named as 's<ex>er</ex>uaunt to the right honorable the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/25940/" type="Collective_Office">L<ex>ord</ex> highe Admiral</rs>,' but it also refers to the troupe as 'al one
            companie s<ex>er</ex>uant<ex>es</ex> to o<ex>u</ex>r verie good the L<ex>or</ex>d the

              Chambers, <title>Elizabethan Stage</title>, vol 2, p 123.</note> Apparently Alleyn
            retained his individual affiliation with his influential patron, the lord admiral, but
            at some point moved to join Strange's men at the Rose. In October 1592 he married
            Henslowe's step-daughter, Joan, so the personal bonds were strong from at least that
            year forward if not before.<note type="foot">For a biography of Alleyn's multi-faceted life, see Jan Piggott, <title>Dulwich College: A History, 1616–2008</title> (London, 2008), 1-55.</note></p>
          <p>An intriguing confusion in court records of payment for performances during the 1590/1
              <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/41461/" type="CalendarDay_Liturgical">Christmas</rs> and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/200104/" type="CalendarDay_Liturgical">Shrovetide</rs> seasons may be evidence of an even
            earlier association of Alleyn with Henslowe and Strange's men. The treasurer of the
            chamber accounts record payment on 7 March 1590/1 to the actor <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/202577/" type="Person_Commoner">George Attwell</rs>, on behalf of Strange's men, for two performances by his company
            on 27 December 1590 and 16 February 1590/1.<note type="foot">TNA: E 351/542, mb 155d; see

              27.</note> Yet puzzlingly, the privy council, on a separate occasion on 5 March
            1590/1, authorized warrants for payment instead to lord admiral's men for the
            performances on those same dates.<note type="foot">See Great Britain, John Roche Dasent

              MacLean, <title>Lord Strange's Men</title>, pp 46–57.</note> Which record is correct?
            In his article 'The Chimera of Amalgamation,' Andrew Gurr has suggested that this was
            not an instance of a fleeting amalgamation of the two companies.<note type="foot"><title>Theatre Research International</title> 18.2 (1993), 85–93.</note> Rather,
            because <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/25845/" type="Person_Nobility">Charles Howard</rs>, the lord admiral, was present at the 5
            March privy council meeting, the official record made at the time acknowledged Alleyn's
            primary affiliation, in deference, though he was performing on both occasions with
            Strange's men. In any case, Alleyn was to become Henslowe's key professional partner in
            several entertainment ventures and they were to prosper together for many years on
            Bankside and beyond.</p>
          <p>The history of the Rose playhouse itself has been outlined in the previous section of
            this introduction. Following his older brother John's death in 1591, Henslowe inherited
            the memorandum book in which John had earlier recorded some of his Sussex mining accounts
              (1576–81).<note type="foot">See Cerasano, 'Henslowe's Biography,' pp 67–8, and Foakes,
                <title>Henslowe's Diary</title>, pp xix-xxiv.</note> By 19 February 1591/2, he began
            to add notes of his own so a more detailed picture of theatrical performances and
            further renovations of the playhouse emerges, thanks to its survival – unique for the
            era. But Henslowe did not rest with managing this innovative venture. Rather, he moved
            ahead with what looks like a strategic plan to acquire more lands on Bankside as well as
            the monopoly on the lucrative bearbaiting enterprise. In December 1594 Edward Alleyn
            bought the lease of the Bear Garden properties at the Bell and Cock from <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/202643/" type="Person_Commoner">Thomas Burnaby</rs> – that purchase included an arena, bear house, bull house,
            cottage, stable, and hayloft. He also was licensed as a deputy by <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/199476/" type="Person_Commoner">Ralph Bowes</rs>, then the court-appointed <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/160515/" type="Collective_Office">master of the bears, bulls, and mastiff dogs</rs>, to hold games on the site, with
            obvious profits to be made from paying customers.<note type="foot">See Alleyn's
              Memorandum Book, DC: MS VIII, f 5v, where he notes the cost of the Bear Garden lease
              as £200: Foakes, <title>Henslowe's Diary</title>, p 301, and the
                <title>Henslowe-Alleyn Digitisation Project</title> MS 8 f <ref target="https://henslowe-alleyn.org.uk/catalogue/mss-8/005-verso/">5v</ref>. The
              licence cost a further £250. When Alleyn sold his stake to Henslowe in February
              1610/11, he calculated his annual profit from the venture at £60 per annum for a total
              of £960. Quoted by Greg, <title>Henslowe Papers</title>, p 107.</note> Half the
            interest in this bearbaiting enterprise and property he then shared with Henslowe.<note type="foot">Details are provided in Edward Alleyn's Answer to the Bill of Complaint in

          </p>
          <p>With the consolidation of property along Bankside, Henslowe and Alleyn began developing
            a joint venture for acquiring monopoly of the bearbaiting games there, including the
            court appointment as master of the bears, bulls, and mastiff dogs. The master had a
            number of privileges beyond the lustre of the court appointment. There was a reward each
            time a baiting was held at one of the royal palaces such as <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/124560/" type="Place_F_Residence">Whitehall</rs> – and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/11772/" type="Person_Royalty">the queen</rs>, nobility, and foreign visitors did delight in
            this type of entertainment. The master also had sole right to license the many touring
            bearwards on the provincial circuits, while also receiving a percentage of their
            profits. And then there were the profits from the Bear Garden itself, as well as from
            the breeding and sale of mastiffs.<note type="foot">See further Cerasano, 'Master of the
              Bears,' pp 195–209.</note> There were expenses too, of course, but there is no doubt
            that Henslowe and Alleyn were aiming for the appointment soon after the acquisition of
            the Bear Garden lease at the Bell and Cock. Letters indicating that they held this
            ambition survive from 1598, the year when the master, Ralph Bowes, sickened and died. On
            4 June, Henslowe wrote to Alleyn as follows:</p>

          <p>The mention in the letter of 'ower other matter betwext vs' is intriguing. By 1598
            Alleyn had taken his leave of the stage and would not return until the opening of a new
            playhouse in 1600 to be occupied by the lord admiral's men – the Fortune, located on <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/226924/" type="Place_F_Street">Whitecross Street</rs> in the parish of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/224777/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">St Giles without Cripplegate</rs> just north of the city walls. Both Victor Landro
            and Susan Cerasano have persuasively argued that this move was at the planning stage for
            the two partners during Alleyn's brief retirement and predated Alleyn's acquisition of
            the lease for the site in December 1599.<note type="foot">For details of the lease see

            that the lord admiral's men were forced to abandon the Rose because of competition from
            the Globe after the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/127834/" type="Collective_Troupe">lord chamberlain's men</rs> moved from the Theatre north of

            shifting demographic and a burgeoning new audience in the northern suburbs would not
            have escaped the notice of Henslowe and Alleyn, even as they expanded their business
            interests in the Bear Garden.<note type="foot">See Landro, ‘Henslowe’s Relocation,’ pp
              37-8.</note> Finding a suitable property, securing funding, and negotiating a lease
            would have taken considerable time and would not likely have been deferred until 1599 by
            two partners as strategic in their thinking as Henslowe and Alleyn. When the neighbours
            were roused to protest construction of the new playhouse to the privy council early in
            1600, Alleyn was well-positioned to appeal for support to his powerful patron, the lord
            admiral, and the queen, an appreciative member of the audience at his court performances
            in times past. Subsequent organization of support for the playhouse at the community
            level, with the promise of generous tithes for the local poor, won the day.<note type="foot">Documents relating to the construction of the Fortune that mention the

            negotiations, but Henslowe supervised the construction process and assumed partnership
            of the Fortune in 1600, with 'a half-share of the playhouse and its profits for a term
            of twenty-four years at an annual rent of £8.'<note type="foot"> See further Landro,

              now lost partnership lease between Alleyn and Henslowe.</note> The Fortune opened with
            the lord admiral's men in residence in the late autumn 1600. The last record in the

          <p>Back on Bankside, the determined patience of the partners was rewarded in 1604 when Dorrington died.
            They moved quickly to purchase the patent for the mastership of the bears,
            bulls, and mastiff dogs from <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/203965/" type="Person_Gentry">Sir
              William Stewart</rs>, a Scottish friend of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/17496/" type="Person_Royalty">James
              I</rs> who was first recipient of the royal appointment. £450 was the charge for the
            privilege, a hefty sum that Henslowe and Alleyn were nonetheless able to muster for this
            long-desired and prestigious position.<note type="foot">The royal patent for the
              appointment was recorded on 24 November 1604: see TNA: C66/1648, mbs 27–8. A partial
              draft of the patent survives in DC: MS II, see <ref target="https://henslowe-alleyn.org.uk/transcriptions/mss-2-article-5/">my
                transcript</ref> on the <title>Henslowe-Alleyn Digitisation Project</title>.</note>
            Within two years they began renovations at the Bear Garden where a more substantial
            welcoming gatehouse named the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/237532/" type="Place_F_VictuallingHouse">Dancing Bears</rs> was built on the Bell and Cock site.<note type="foot">The building
              contract on 2 June 1606 with Peter Street survives as DC: MS II, single mb (not
              reproduced on the <title>Henslowe-Alleyn Digitisation Project</title> website). The
              contract will be published in the Bear Garden/Hope edition forthcoming in the REED
              series.</note></p>

          <p>Henslowe's decision to abandon renewal of the lease for the Rose in 1605 may have been
            the result of several factors, not only the proposed increase in cost of the lease.
            Since 1600 there had not been any continuity in companies resident at the aging
            playhouse while the lord admiral's men were soon flourishing at the new Fortune.
            Furthermore, the serious recurrence of plague in 1603 led to lengthy closure of the
            London area playhouses. Henslowe's Bankside priority in this period may well have been
            renovation of the Bear Garden although he also continued his acquisition of other
            properties, picking up the lease of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/231751/" type="Place_F_Property">the
              Great Pike Garden</rs> further west along Bankside in 1609.<note type="foot">See
              Warner, <title>Catalogue</title>, vol 1, p 141, for MS V, f 44 (not reproduced on the
                <title>Henslowe-Alleyn Digitisation Project</title> website). </note> All of his
            properties had houses and shops that brought regular income to the owner of the lease,
            so Henslowe was by no means dependent on the quirky and unpredictable fortunes of his
            first playhouse. Around the same time Alleyn was building his own substantial estate,
            soon acquiring the manor of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/237554/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Dulwich</rs> in the Surrey countryside where he eventually relocated.<note type="foot">Alleyn purchased the manor of Dulwich from <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/204147/" type="Person_Gentry">Sir
                Francis Calton</rs> in 1606 for £5,000, with regular payments due over seven years.
              He probably relocated there from Bankside by 1612. See Jan Piggott, <title>Dulwich
                College: A History, 1616–2008</title> (London, 2008).</note> Perhaps for financial
            reasons he therefore sold Henslowe his share in the Bear Garden in 1610/11, though he
            retained the share in the mastership and the Fortune Playhouse operation.<note type="foot">DC: MS VIII, f 5v.</note></p>

          <p xml:id="background-henslowe-status">An increase in status at court was not only
            confirmed by acquisition of the mastership of the bears, bulls, and mastiff dogs, but
            also by Henslowe's royal appointment in 1603 as a gentleman sewer of the Chamber.<note type="foot">Cerasano, 'The Geography of Henslowe’s Diary,' <title>Shakespeare
                Quarterly</title> 56.3 (2005), 338.</note> In 1606 he was named as a gentleman
            pensioner and granted a pension from the Crown.<note type="foot">Cerasano, 'Elizabethan
              Court,' pp 51, 53.</note> As a man of considerable property, he also assumed
            leadership roles in his home parish of St Saviour's Southwark. The opening of the relationship may not
            have been promising. The vestry minutes of St Saviour's in 1598 note anxiety about the
            playhouses located within their parish boundaries: by 1595 <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/151032/" type="Person_Commoner">Francis Langley</rs>'s Swan theatre had opened in the manor of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/223902/" type="Place_PA_Manor">Paris Garden</rs> just west of Bankside. On 19 July, the following order was
            recorded: 'Inprimis it was ordered at this vestrye that a petic<ex>i</ex>on shalbe made
            to the bodye of the Councell concerninge the playehouses in this p<ex>ar</ex>yshe

            that in respecte thereof they maye be dismissed &amp; putt downe from
              playeinge....'<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#rosep-ridm96581496"/></note> There
            had been a previous order in May (renewed twice) that the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/3576/" type="Collective_ClergyAndChurchwardens">churchwardens</rs> ask the playhouse owners
            to contribute tithes for the poor, but no evidence survives that they did so. However,
            as Paul White explains further in his forthcoming essay, 'Philip Henslowe and Edward
            Alleyn in Parish Politics and Service,' the social capital to be gained from actively
            participating in the lay leadership of his home parish was not lost on Henslowe. 'One
            needed to have lived in the parish for at least eight years to be a vestryman, but
            Henslowe’s name in the Token Books as a communicant in the Spring of 1588, and just about
            every year thereafter, indicates that he fulfilled that requirement by about 1596 and
            was a parishioner in good standing. He was certainly wealthy enough and sufficiently
            well-connected at court in the 1590s to have qualified for the vestry. Moreover, he was
            a commissioner of the lay subsidy in 1593, 1594, and 1597, a prestigious appointment and
            reserved usually for vestrymen.'<note type="foot">See Ingram and Nelson, <ref target="http://tokenbooks.folger.edu/">The Token Books of St Saviour Southwark</ref>

            regular attender at the almost monthly meetings despite his many other responsibilities.
            The following year in 1608 he was chosen churchwarden, a term renewed in 1609. In the
            latter year he was also appointed as one of the governors of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/235076/" type="Place_F_School">St

          <p>Following the closure of the Rose in 1605 (if not before), the final phase of
            Henslowe's career needs only be covered briefly here. Although Alleyn would continue to
            develop diversified interests elsewhere, Henslowe's focus seems to have been more on
            Bankside where he lived. By <hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1612 he began planning for another
            playhouse that would combine what had been separate enterprises at the now demolished
            Rose and the ongoing Bear Garden. In 1613, with another partner, the waterman Jacob
            Meade who had been working at the Bear Garden since the late '90s, he conceived of a
            multi-purpose entertainment centre with a removeable stage, that could mount weekly plays,
            animal baitings (at least bi-weekly), and other types of amusement such as <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/204281/" type="Entertainer_Type">‘flytings,’</rs> in which contestants hurled scurrilous verse at each other. Some
            helpfully detailed contracts for the demolition of the old Bear Garden arena and

            well-known quotation from the induction of that play sheds some light on why the playing
            troupes moved to less odorous quarters by the end of this decade:</p>

            that some here perhaps would have it, yet think that therein the author hath observed a

              1971), 19–62.</note> His final assessment can be quoted: 'Historically Henslowe
            represented the manager of the future at an early stage of development. Yet his ability
            to function as a manager or producer was blocked by the structure of the acting company.
            In fact, the two could not co-exist. Shared responsibility among working actors not only
            followed different procedures of decision-making but had no room for managerial
            guidance. The company needed financing but not control and, in fact, resisted control by
            a single individual.'<note type="foot">Beckerman, 'Henslowe,' pp
              59–60.</note> Beckerman suggested that four periods can be identified in the growth of
            Henslowe's role as a proto-theatre manager.<note type="foot">Beckerman, 'Henslowe,' p
              28. Gurr, <title>Shakespeare's Opposites</title>, pp 82–3, seems to accept Beckerman's
              identification of the four phases, while noting that the diary does not always reveal
              which role, whether as landlord or banker, Henslowe was assuming when he made his
              account entries.</note></p>

          <p>In the first phase at the Rose (up to 1596–7), Henslowe was acting
            primarily as a landlord, with less direct involvement in the company's operations. The
            second, 'late Rose-early Fortune,' period, ran from mid-1596 to early 1604, a time when
            playing companies were challenged by increasing efforts by the authorities in London and
            on the privy council to control the number of playhouses and their operation, while they
            also faced more competition and plague closures. Henslowe seems to have attempted
            greater involvement as banker with lord admiral's men during this period, offering loans
            to the company during seasons of declining performance income at the Rose or at court
            (for example, 1596–7, when they were not invited). Carson's review of evidence in the
            diary for these years notes an extension of involvement in company affairs: 'Beginning
            in the Spring-Summer season of 1598, Henslowe seems to have provided most of the money
            spent on playbooks, costumes, and properties by Admiral's Men.'<note type="foot">

            also on record posting bonds for two actors who had defected to join <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/199956/" type="Collective_Troupe">Pembroke's men</rs> in 1597 at the rival Swan playhouse, as well as for two others
            seeking to join lord admiral's men at the Rose after the controversial performance of
            Jonson and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/204304/" type="Person_Commoner">Nashe</rs>'s <title><rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/237614/" type="Event_Performance">Isle of Dogs</rs></title> play in July 1597.<note type="foot">See further below 'History of the Playhouse.'</note> 
            If, as may be the case, Langley had initiated the idea of
            requiring <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/8782/" type="Entertainer_Type">actors</rs> to sign bonds with him before playing at the Swan,
            Henslowe was to follow his example in adopting this deeper involvement in the affairs of
            the lord admiral's men. Entries in the diary show that he required the disaffected
            actors recruited from Pembroke's men, as well as others, totalling ten altogether, to
            guarantee that they would play only at the Rose for stated terms ranging from one to
            three years.<note type="foot">Beckerman, 'Henslowe,' pp 36–42, outlines the details of
              the loans to the company and the players' bonds established by Langley and Henslowe

            stage, leaving Henslowe to manage relations with the company more directly. However,
            despite their apparent dependency on periodic financial loans, the evidence suggests
            that he was unable to assert substantial control of the management of the lord admiral's
            men who repaid their debts whenever they could. 'It would appear that the landlord was
            satisfied to lend money to the players in order to keep them at his theatre, where he
            earned a more than satisfactory income from rent.'<note type="foot">Carson,
                <title>Companion</title>, p 27. A more recent review of the evidence for Henslowe's
              evolving management style at the Rose has been done by Mao, 'Rose Playhouse,' pp
              146–59.</note> In other words, the gain was stability for the playhouse operation
            rather than control of the company's productions while in residence there.<note type="foot">The goal of 'stability' was recognized by Beckerman, 'Henslowe,' p
              43.</note></p>

          <p>The third period highlights Henslowe's management of the Bear Garden, in partnership
            with Alleyn until 1610. The fourth and final phase Beckerman termed the 'Hope period,'
            beginning in 1611 when the new company of Lady Elizabeth's men first signed articles of
            agreement with Henslowe.<note type="foot">See further Siobhan Keenan, <title>Acting
                Companies and their Plays in Shakespeare's London</title> (London, 2014), 33–52, for
              Lady Elizabeth's men as a case study. The 1611 agreement has not survived but is
              referred to in a bond signed by actors of the company on 29 August 1611 (see further
              Gurr, <title>Shakespearian Playing Companies</title>, pp 397–8, and Greg,
                <title>Henslowe Papers</title>, p 111, for the bond, DC: MS XVIII, Article 9, also
              citing DC: Mun 47 as 'Almost identical.')</note> Almost two decades after the opening
            of the Rose, Henslowe's management style had evolved so that he was more forceful in his
            dealings with Lady Elizabeth's men. When he and Jacob Meade launched work on the Hope playhouse
            on Bankside in 1613, they were making plans for Lady Elizabeth's men to be resident.
            Articles of Agreement drawn up with the actor <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/204862/" type="Person_Commoner">Nathan Field</rs> representing the company around the same time illustrate Henslowe's

            toward genuine management.'</note>
            Articles of Grievance and Oppression drawn up by the company by 1615 survive in the
            Henslowe-Alleyn archive to illustrate that relations between Henslowe and the players
            may have become frayed as a result.<note type="foot">DC: MS I, single sheet. See Greg,

          <p>When Henslowe died on 6 January 1615/16, he was a man of wealth and property, drawing
            income from numerous rentals, various court appointments, and successful business
            ventures that centred on entertainment, primarily on Bankside. He appears to have kept
            his investments and partnerships under effective control during his lifetime, but once
            dead, the rights to his estate became subject to bitter conflict and interminable court
            cases that will be included in the forthecoming REED edition for the Bear Garden/Hope records. 
            Was Henslowe really worth the £10,000 to £12,000 that
            his avaricious nephew claimed and clearly wanted a slice of? Poor Agnes, who inherited
            the bulk of the estate, was described in a dispute over the will, as ‘aged almost 100
            yeares and grown Childishe and very simple.’ Edward Alleyn
            was accused of ‘most cunninglie’ insinuating himself into the process of drawing up a
            version of the will during Henslowe’s final hours.<note type="foot">TNA: C 33/133 A (17
              November 1616), ff 240v–1.</note> For quite a few years a formerly functional family
            and partnerships fell into disarray but it is worth noting that Alleyn, also a man of
            influence and strategy, was well-placed as son-in-law to Agnes Henslowe to inherit much
            of the estate left to her by her husband.</p>

          <p>Admittedly, the diary does not have a complete and readily understood accounting of the
            full run of plays performed and profits taken throughout the almost twenty years of
            theatrical activity at the Rose.<note type="foot">See Carson, <title>Companion</title>,
              p 8 and his summary (p 13) after a detailed analysis of the diary: 'It is difficult to
              imagine how <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/129736/" type="Person_Commoner">Henslowe</rs> could have supervised his various business
              enterprises without a fuller set of books including, at the very least, a ledger in
              which he would have recorded his transactions with individuals. If such books existed,
              possibly they became separated from the diary at the time of Henslowe's death.
              Whatever the truth, we must recognize, I think, that the diary contains only a partial
              record of Henslowe's activities, albeit a record maintained by a reasonably
              painstaking individual.' See also Gurr, <title>Shakespeare's Opposites</title>, pp

          <p>In very brief summary of the archaeological discovery, the developer group Imry Merchant acquired the site, intending
            to demolish the existing 1957 office block named Southbridge House before erecting a new
            building now known as Rose Court. A short-term, ten-week archaeological assessment and
            excavation was required by the Southwark Council before construction could commence and
            was funded by the developer. However, ten weeks rapidly turned into six months, as
            Blatherwick and Pickard explain: 'The totality of the survival of those remains plus the
            unprecedented public response towards the extant structure, associated with both <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/199852/" type="Person_Commoner">William Shakespeare</rs> and the development of modern English dramatic tradition,

          <p>Only two-thirds of the site could be excavated at the time, so the eastern side of the
            playhouse remains to discover. What has been uncovered reveals that the original
            structure was a thatched timber-framed polygon consisting of fourteen sides
            approximately 72' in diameter. There were two rings of walls surrounding an open yard,
            with no reliable proof of the exact location of the exterior entrance into the yard,

                <title>Rose and the Globe</title>, pp 111, 114. It may also be indicative that the
              entrance door to the playhouse is shown at the south end on both versions of John
              Norden's map (1593 and 1600, see below).</note> The stage, tapered in shape, projected
            out into the north section of the yard between bays 6 and 10, delimited by the inner
            wall at the north. Bowsher summarizes its measurements –which surprised many scholars at
            the time – as follows: 'At the front it had three edges, a long central one and two
            tapering shorter sides. It thus had a depth of 5m (16ft 5in.) and an estimated maximum
            width of 11.5m (36ft 9in.) narrowing to 8.2m (26ft 10in.) at the front, covering an area
            of about 46.4m (499.45sq ft).... The wooden boards of the actual stage would certainly
            have been raised above the level of the yard, perhaps by 1.52m (5ft) as recorded at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/228179/" type="Place_F_Playhouse">the
              Red Lion</rs>. The front stage wall at the Rose survives to a height of about 0.12m (4
            3/4in.) above the yard but flush with the surface under the stage. It was therefore a
            permanent feature, unlike the temporary trestles employed at the later Hope....'<note type="foot">Bowsher, <title>Rose Theatre</title>, 39–40. Given the fixed stage,
              Bowsher, in a later essay, refutes the speculation that the Rose might have been first
              intended to serve as a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/21767/" type="Entertainment_AnimalSport">bearbaiting</rs> arena before serving as a
              playhouse, an idea floated by Jon Greenfield and Andrew Gurr in 'The Rose Theatre,

                <title>Antiquity</title> 78 (June 2004), 330–40. See further Bowsher, 'The Rose and
              its Stages,' <title>Shakespeare Survey</title> 60 (2007), 36–48.</note> There was no
            evidence of supporting pillar bases for a roof overhanging the stage or a projecting
            tiring house: the area between the outer and inner back walls of the stage likely served
            the latter purpose.<note type="foot">Bowsher, <title>Rose Theatre</title>, p 69, n 11,

            Bowsher, on the subject of a trapdoor: 'The stage surface itself is assumed to have been
            wooden boards, raised well above the yard surface. Within the footprint of the stage was
            a plaster surface that would suggest that there was an under stage area or void, which
            might have provided storage room and access on to the stage proper through a
              trapdoor.'<note type="foot">'Encounters Between Actors, Audience and Archaeologists at

          <p>According to Bowsher, the open yard, of friable grey mortar, where the groundlings
            stood, would have measured approximately 117.3m (1262.62 square feet), 'some 15m (49ft 2

              provides details that we can only wish we had for the upper structure of the
              Rose.</note> The northern section of the yard had a notable slope, raked to the front
            of the stage. No evidence of an exterior stair tower, interior staircase, or the number
            of galleries was discovered, though either two or three galleries seem likely.</p>

          <p>There is no direct documentary evidence known about the company or companies first

            memorandum book. Furthermore, the speculative dating of 1592 or 1593 has been typically
            assigned to the petition from Strange's men to the privy council and the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/137174/" type="Collective_Occupation">watermen</rs>'s companion petition to the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/25845/" type="Person_Nobility">lord

However, Alan H. Nelson has studied the seventeen signatures
            on the watermen’s petition, discovering from his St Saviour's parish register research
            that two of those signing were dead by 1591.<note type="foot">Nelson has not yet
              published his 2012 conference paper, ‘Philip Henslowe and the Bankside Watermen: A
              Fresh Look at Three Familiar Documents’ (paper, University of Reading, November 24,

            the previous summer of 1590 therefore becomes a viable date for the petitions and, just
            possibly, the year before.</p>

          <p>Strange's men were a large company performing plays by some of the best in the business

            self-described ‘poore watermen,' who benefitted from ferrying the constant traffic
            across the Thames to the theatre. The reference to the players' hope of a command
            performance before the queen is worth remarking on. Some of the most seasoned actors of
            the day had joined Lord Strange's men following the death of their previous patron, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/44753/" type="Person_Nobility">the
              earl of Leicester</rs>, in September 1588.<note type="foot">For details of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/48635/" type="Collective_Troupe">Leicester's men</rs> and the formation of their new company, see <title>Lord
                Strange's Men</title>, pp 30–6.</note> During the Christmas and Shrovetide seasons,
            1590–90/1, they were to perform twice at court, so their anticipation of such a
            lucrative opportunity, <hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1590, was not unfounded. As noted in the
            next section, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/153045/" type="Person_Commoner">Edward Alleyn</rs>, the star actor from <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/25827/" type="Collective_Troupe">lord admiral's men</rs>, would join them soon, possibly as early as these first court
            performances, so they must have rapidly become a major attraction on Bankside. The
            following year they were invited to perform an unprecedented six plays at court during
            the festive season, so it is likely that they would have continued to prefer residency
            at the Rose the rest of the year rather than touring the provinces.</p>

          <p>At some point during 1591–2, Henslowe renovated his playhouse, perhaps in response to
            the remarkable success of the resident acting company. Early in his diary, ff 4–5v, he
            notes, in itemized detail, 'such carges as I haue layd owt a bowte my playe howsse in
            the year of or lord 1592.'<note type="foot">See Foakes, <title>Henslowe's Diary</title>,
              pp 9–13, and the <title>Henslowe-Alleyn Digitisation Project</title> MS 7 ff <ref target="https://henslowe-alleyn.org.uk/catalogue/mss-7/004-recto/">4r–5v</ref>.</note> The costs were considerable, totalling around £108.<note type="foot">Carson, <title>Companion</title>, pp 14–15.</note> The 1989 archaeological
            excavation of the site revealed some of these structural renovations made to the
            playhouse with the assistance of the original builder, John Griggs. The alterations were
            focused on rebuilding the northern end of the site to allow for an increase in audience
            capacity and improved staging conditions. The stage was newly constructed: as Bowsher
            describes, it was '...built 2.1m (6ft 10 1/2in.) farther north than the original. It had
            a depth of 5.6m (18ft 4in.) and it is estimated to have been 8.4m (27ft 7in.) long,
            although its front length was not fully uncovered by our excavation. This would have
            provided a complete stage area of about 50.5m<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> (543.58sq
            ft).... Although its dimensions were not much larger than those of the first stage, it
            was slightly more rectangular and gave the impression of a greater "thrust" because of
            the extension of the yard on each side of it.'<note type="foot">Bowsher, <title>Rose
                Theatre</title>, pp 48–50.</note> Surviving evidence of pillars close to the front
            corners of the stage suggests that a roof for full stage cover was provided for the
            first time, thereby necessitating the widening outward of the galleries to the east and
            west to preserve sight lines. The yard was thus substantially expanded by an estimated
            thirty-nine per cent 'to cover about 163m<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> (1754 1/2sq
              ft).<note type="foot">Bowsher, <title>Rose Theatre</title>, p 51.</note> It was barely
            raked, in contrast to the incline of the first, and the original mortar was replaced
            with a mix of compacted earth, cinder, and cracked hazelnut shells.<note type="foot">Full details of the second phase of the building discovered during the archaeological
              excavation in 1989 are provided in Bowsher and Miller, <title>Rose and the

              drawing, fig 50.</note> Henslowe's own renovation notes on f 5v of the diary indicate
            the addition of a 'penthowwse shed' added at the tiring house door behind the stage, but
            no trace was found of its construction or precise site during the excavation. He also
            refers for the first time to a lords' room and its ceiling but the location of this
            special seating area was not revealed either.<note type="foot">See Foakes,

          <p>As the diary confirms, in 1592–3 Lord Strange's men performed at Henslowe's Rose, with
            an extended run from 19 February–22 June 1592, and another from 29 December 1592–1
            February 1592/3. It seems improbable that they would have mounted their plays during the
            period of reconstruction of the north end of the playhouse, so the February/March 1591/2
            dates of Henslowe's 'carges' would seem to favour Neil Carson's assessment that 'The
            receipts are for large bills which were probably presented some months after the work
            was completed. The other expenses listed on folios 4–5 have the appearance of an account

          <p>External events, however, would disrupt the continuous operation of the Rose in the
            early 1590s. The first followed the performance of

            events that had happened recently when Feltmakers' apprentices clashed with the knight

            apprentices in Southwark was not named, the Rose would have been the only playhouse
            available for a performance there. However reluctant they may have been, this very large
            and successful company of Strange's men was therefore forced to tour the provinces, with
            some of their performance stops on record, starting with an appearance at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/234727/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">Rye</rs> in <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/2309/" type="Place_County">Sussex</rs> on 24 June.<note type="foot">For details of their

          <p>The second season in repertory at the Rose began soon after the first of six
            performances at court on 27 December. Between 29 December and 1 February 1592/3
            Strange's men were back in residence but a serious outbreak of plague led to another
            privy council order on 28 January for closure of all London area theatres for the
            duration of 1593.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#rosep-ridm92826968"/>.</note>
            Strange's men would never return to the Rose and Henslowe does not record performances
            and profits taken again until 27 December 1593 when he itemizes the appearances of the

            Thirty performances were offered, with a total of thirteen plays in repertory.<note type="foot">Chambers, <title>Elizabethan Stage</title>, vol 2, pp 92–6, and Gurr,
                <title>Shakespearian Companies</title>, pp 174–7, 182–4, both provide concise
              summaries of the career and repertory of this company. Both sources give a starting
              date of 26 December and a count of twelve plays during Sussex's first run at the Rose,
              but a check of the diary corrects that reckoning.</note> The inclusion of <title><rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/237198/" type="Event_Performance">Titus Andronicus</rs></title>, presumed to belong to <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/199956/" type="Collective_Troupe">Pembroke's men</rs>, and Strange's <title><rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/237355/" type="Event_Performance">The Jew of Malta</rs></title> in their schedule has led some scholars to deduce
            that Sussex's company now included some actors from Pembroke's men and others from the
            remnants of the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/175847/" type="Collective_Troupe">earl of Derby's men</rs>. <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/141308/" type="Person_Nobility">Henry

            company began playing at the Rose so they would have been in transition during the early
            part of 1594. <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/153107/" type="Person_Nobility">Ferdinando Stanley</rs>, Lord Strange, assumed the title as earl of Derby upon <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/45283/" type="Person_Nobility">his father's</rs> death on 25 September 1593. By late 1593 he had lost favour at court and his company probably had to seek patronage
            elsewhere. When the key players resumed activities in mid-1594 they were re-formed as
            the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/223085/" type="Collective_Troupe">lord chamberlain’s men</rs>, soon to include both <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/199997/" type="Person_Commoner">Richard Burbage</rs> and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/199852/" type="Person_Commoner">Shakespeare</rs> in their ranks, but at a different theatre. Where they were during
            the first half of the year remains a mystery but the title page of <title>Titus
              Andronicus</title>, entered in the Stationers' Register on 6 February 1593/4, may hold
            a clue to temporary amalgamation of some of the actors from each company in the
            attribution 'Plaide by the Right Honourable the Earle of Derbie, Earle of Pembrooke, and Earle of Sussex their Seruants.'<note type="foot">See further Scott McMillin,

          <p>Another break in the performance schedule resulted from the privy council's order

            plays was imposed again for fear of plague: 'Wee thearfore thought it very expedient to

            the peace in Surrey do not survive, there seems no doubt that the Rose was forced to
            close again, not to reopen for business until 1–8 April when the diary notes eight
            performances of five plays there by Sussex's and the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/17169/" type="Collective_Troupe">queen's men</rs> together.<note type="foot">See Foakes, <title>Henslowe's

          <p>During this period of plague and uncertainty for acting companies and playhouse owners,
            Edward Alleyn seems to have returned to his former mates in the lord admiral’s men. No
            surprise, perhaps, that Henslowe's son-in-law and partner Alleyn, who was also the lead
              <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/8782/" type="Entertainer_Type">actor</rs> of the company, would accept Henslowe's offer to make their base at the
            Rose. Between 14 May 1594 and 13 July 1600 the lord admiral's men began a long-term
            engagement at the Rose that was broken only by periodic interventions by the privy
            council when plague fears resurfaced, by required closures during <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/41869/" type="CalendarDay_Liturgical">Lent</rs>, or by very occasional disruptive events.<note type="foot">See Foakes, <title>Henslowe's Diary</title>, pp 21–35, and the
                <title>Henslowe-Alleyn Digitisation Project</title> MS 7 ff <ref target="https://henslowe-alleyn.org.uk/catalogue/mss-7/009-recto/">9r–14v</ref>.</note> During such interruptions they can sometimes be found on limited
            tours in the provinces but their preference was clearly for London and the court where
            they were invited to perform annually fourteen times before 1600 (with the sole
            exception of 1596–7).<note type="foot">For performances at court, see Gurr, 'Appendix
              4,' <title>Shakespeare's Opposites</title>, p 293.</note></p>

          <p>Gurr has proposed that in May 1594 <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/123685/" type="Person_Nobility">Henry Carey</rs>, the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/37031/" type="Collective_Office">lord chamberlain of the royal household</rs>, with his
            son-in-law, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/25845/" type="Person_Nobility">Charles Howard</rs>, the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/25940/" type="Collective_Office">lord admiral</rs>, established a 'duopoly' of officially sanctioned acting troupes
            under their patronage that would henceforth dominate the London theatre scene while also
            satisfying the need to provide the queen with court entertainment during the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/41461/" type="CalendarDay_Liturgical">Christmas</rs> and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/200104/" type="CalendarDay_Liturgical">Shrovetide</rs> festive season.<note type="foot">Gurr
              assumes the establishment of a duopoly in many of his publications. For a summary of
              the proposal see his article, 'Henry Carey's Peculiar Letter,' <title>Shakespeare
                Quarterly</title> 56 (2005), 51–75, and <title>Shakespeare's Opposites</title>, pp
              2–6. Gurr's 'Appendix 3,' p 290, also lists the admiral's men touring dates,
              1594–1600, but see further REED, <ref target="https://reed.library.utoronto.ca"><title>Patrons and Performances</title></ref>, for fuller details of their
              touring career and provincial performance venues during their years in primary
              residence at the Rose.</note> Engaging in current debates about this admittedly
            speculative proposal seems unnecessary within the focused context of this collection.
            However, a healthy skepticism seems in order, given the lack of documentary evidence.
            There is sufficient resistance to regulation by authorities on record to suggest that
            the explosion of creative talent and the drive for commercial success in London, and by
            extension, at court, in the entertainment business during this era might have challenged
            such an attempt to restrict playing in the London area to only two companies at only two
              playhouses.<note type="foot">Holger Schott Syme lays out some of the challenges to the

          <p>The first interruption in the new arrangement between Henslowe and the re-formed lord
            admiral's men seems to have occurred between 17 May and 14 June. From 3–13 June both the
            lord admiral's men and the recently formed lord chamberlain's men moved to the old
            playhouse at Newington Butts, less conveniently located a mile to the south and soon to
            be closed. Laurie Johnson has recently done an in-depth study of this relatively unknown
            and little documented playhouse and its brief glory days when two famous Elizabethan
            companies brought their talents to its stage. He proposes that extreme weather and
            flooding on the marshy Bankside during the 1594 'year of floods' must have caused
            Henslowe's move to negotiate rental of an alternative space with the Newington Butts
            owner, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/133645/" type="Person_Commoner">Peter Hunningborne</rs>: 'I suggest the ongoing rain and spates
            of high waters took their toll on Henslowe's Bankside venue, forcing him to consider
            viable alternatives, and Newington's indoor venue on high ground would seem to have been
            just that.'<note type="foot">Johnson, <title>Shakespeare's Lost Playhouse</title>, pp
              143–4. See further pp 136–7 and 140–5. MacLean's small edition of dramatic records for
              Newington Butts will be forthcoming in the REED series.</note> Whether the two
            companies performed the seven plays mounted there together (some more than once) or
            alternated remains the subject of ongoing debate as Henslowe groups his entries together
            under a common heading and the exact number and membership of the companies during this
            era of formation are not known.<note type="foot">See, for example, Greg,
                <title>Diary</title>, vol 2, pt 2 pp 85–6, and more recently, Johnson,
                <title>Shakespeare's Lost Playhouse</title>, p 145, and Gurr, <title>Shakespeare's

          <p>When the lord admiral's men returned to the Rose on 15 June, they settled in for a long
            residency, their almost daily performances for the following year disrupted only by
            performances at court on 28 December and 1 and 6 January.<note type="foot">They ended
              their first run on 26 June 1595: see Foakes, <title>Henslowe's Diary</title>, p 30.
              For a succinct chart of performance dates and related payments for the Rose,
              1594–1600, the 'Chronological Abstract of the Diary in so far as it Relates to
              Dramatic Affairs' provided by Greg, <title>Diary</title>, vol 2, pp 328–32, remains
              useful and is not repeated here. Chambers, <title>Elizabethan Stage</title>, vol 2, pp
              141–3, 159–60, also summarizes the dates of opening and closing at the Rose, as
              witnessed, not always consistently, by Henslowe.</note> In fact, Henslowe's accounting
            practices between 15 June 1594 and 5 November 1597 allow a relatively reliable view of
            the repertory schedule at the Rose before he shifts to a notably different style of
            record. Gurr has traced the membership, performances, repertory practices, and play
            texts during the company's sojourn at the Rose in detail in his study of the company in
              <title>Shakespeare's Opposites</title>, to which the reader is referred. Earlier
            studies of the company and its career at the Rose include Chambers' summary in
              <title>Elizabethan Stage</title>, vol 2, pp 139–73, and Greg's earlier edition of
              <title>Henslowe's Diary</title> with extensive commentary and tables of reference in
            volume 2.</p>

          <p>Gurr accounts for 158 plays performed by or written for the lord admiral's men as
            recorded in Henslowe's diary or in the Stationers' Register up to the summer of 1600. Of
            this remarkable repertory only twenty-four have survived in print and two in
              manuscript.<note type="foot">See Gurr, 'Appendix 1,' <title>Shakespeare's
                Opposites</title>, pp 201–53. Others have published their own inventories of plays
              performed at the Rose, with predictable variations in the titles included and the
              interpretation of the diary's records. See, for example, Chambers, <title>Elizabethan
                Stage</title>, vol 2, pp 143–7, 165–71; Rhodes, 'Appendix A,' <title>Henslowe’s
                Rose</title>, pp 185–223; and Scott McMillin who narrows his focus to published and
              manuscript plays that can be securely identified with the Rose, <title>The Elizabethan
                Theatre and </title>
              <title>The Book of Sir Thomas More</title> (Ithaca and London, 1987), 115–24.</note>

            costs for renovations to the playhouse that were largely cosmetic, for painting and
            carpentry. In June the same year he also paid for making a throne for the

            Some competition was surfacing on Bankside at this time. <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/151032/" type="Person_Commoner">Francis Langley</rs>, who had acquired the manor of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/223902/" type="Place_PA_Manor">Paris Garden</rs> in 1589, was a dodgy customer of less evident management abilities
            than Henslowe but by 1595 he may have been inspired by the Rose’s success to open
            another playhouse, named <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/227779/" type="Place_F_Playhouse">the Swan</rs>. The <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/150906/" type="Person_Gentry">lord

            the Swan opened nonetheless during the following year.<note type="foot">The mayor's

          <p>Norden’s 1600 inset map of the city of London (see above) gives a view of the Swan
            playhouse added to the Southwark landscape, west from Bankside in the manor of Paris
            Garden on a corner south from the river. Certainly a Dutch visitor, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/201006/" type="Person_Commoner">Johannes de Witt</rs>, writing to his friend, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/201070/" type="Person_Commoner">Arend van Buchell</rs>, from London, <hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1596, was much
            impressed by the new rival south of the Thames:</p>

          <p>'Of all the theatres, however, the largest and most distinguished is the one whose sign
            is a swan (commonly, the Swan theatre), which, to be sure, accommodates three thousand
            people in seats. [It is] built of an accumulation of flint stones (of which in Britain
            there is a vast abundance) supported by wooden columns which, on account of the colour
            of marble painted on them, can deceive even the most acute, whose form, at least, since
            it [the playhouse] seems to represent the general notion of Roman work, I have drawn
              above.'<note type="foot">This translation from the original copy of the letter made by

            After the heat of the summer season had passed, Henslowe's accounting of receipts

          <p>In fact, playing resumed at the Rose (but not the Swan) on 11 October 1597. As Wickham
            notes, the lord admiral’s men would have been preparing for performances at court during
            the Christmas season, and as they enjoyed the patronage of an influential member of the
            privy council, the need to rehearse well in advance would have facilitated their return
            to the stage in the autumn.<note type="foot">Wickham, 'Privy Council Order,' pp
              32–3.</note> But Langley was not so lucky and had to wait until 1 November before
            reopening the Swan. During the hiatus he also lost several of the actors of Pembroke's

              brief period in 1597, despite having a contract with Edward Alleyn to act with the
              lord admiral's men for three years beginning 26 November 1596. See further 'Edward
              Alleyn, Richard Perkins and the Rivalry between the Swan and the Rose Playhouses,'

            their Bankside base at the Rose, but without Edward Alleyn who retired from the stage in
            the autumn of 1597 for three years to pursue other purposes.<note type="foot">See

          <p>In July 1598, a further, apparently futile, appeal to the privy council was made by
            members of the St Saviour's vestry, requesting that the local playhouses be pulled down
            because of their 'enormyties.'<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#rosep-ridm96581496"/>.</note> Instead, a third playhouse would be erected on Bankside the following year
            when <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/227836/" type="Place_F_Playhouse">the Globe</rs> opened on the south side of Maid Lane, not far from the Rose. This
            playhouse, too, is shown on Norden's 1600 inset map. Much has been made in times past of
            the competition that would thereby ensue between the lord admiral's men and the
            chamberlain's men newly relocated from the Theatre to the Globe in 1599. Did Henslowe
            respond by laying plans to move his enterprise in retreat to the north of the city where
            the Fortune playhouse would open in the autumn of 1600? Roslyn Knutson has argued
            persuasively against a narrative inherited from Chambers that when Henslowe changed his
            style of accounting towards the end of 1597 to record more loans to the company and
            partial payments to playwrights it must mean that the lord admiral's men fell on hard
            times and 'lived from hand to mouth, and had acquired the thriftless habit of sharing
            their profits weekly or even daily, and keeping no reserve fund.'<note type="foot">See
              'The Commercial Significance of the Payments for Playtexts in Henslowe's Diary,

                <title>Elizabethan Stage</title>, vol 1, p 361, and vol 2, p 162, for the
              unjustified depiction of the playwrights as 'extremely out-at-elbows men of letters
              who hung about the Rose' and 'occasionally found it profitable to take their "earnest"
              for a play, and then to find plausible reasons for indefinitely delaying its
              completion.'</note> Instead, when focusing on the 'crucial year' of 1599–1600, 'which
            has the highest incidence of partial payments in the diary,' Knutson does a close
            analysis of the accounts and concludes as follows: 'I suggest that over the years of
            1597–1603 the Admiral's men maintained a large repertory of new and old plays on a
            variety of popular subjects and in a variety of dramatic kinds; that in 1599–1600 they
            increased the number of works-in-progress that they usually financed in order to acquire
            an even larger, newer, and more diversified set of offerings; that in 1600–1, they eased
            the burden of expenses by continuing plays already in repertory and by reviving a few
            old favorities; that in 1601–2 they increased the number of revivals, which not only
            were relatively inexpensive to produce but also served as a showcase for Alleyn's return
            to the stage.'<note type="foot">Knutson, ‘Commercial Significance,’ p 131. An earlier
              article by Neil Carson, 'Production Finance at the Rose Theatre, 1596–98,'
                <title>Theatre Research International</title> 4 (1979), 172–83, also questioned the
              dominant narrative, pointing out through close analysis of various sources of evidence
              between 1596–8 that the diary does not consistently record all expenses and income and
              so cannot be relied upon as a comprehensive witness to playhouse
            operations.</note></p>
          <p>The probability that Henslowe and Alleyn together had conceived of a strategic move to
            the north side of the Thames before <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/228217/" type="Place_F_Playhouse">the Theatre</rs> was dismantled and the Globe opened on Bankside
            has been discussed in the previous chapter, where links to the relevant records in this
            collection can be found. The January 1599/1600 warrant from the lord admiral in support
            of the new playhouse, in particular, refers to 'the dangerous decaye of that Howse'<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#rosep-ridm90723048"/></note> (that is, the Rose).
            Whether these words are an accurate reflection of the Rose's condition or simply
            designed to make a persuasive case for the move of the lord admiral's men to the desired
            new location could be debated. However, the privy council picked up the theme in support
            of Alleyn's building project in their 8 April order, followed by an order on 22 June
            legislating only two playhouses for operation in the London area – the Fortune on the

            venerable <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/228083/" type="Place_F_Playhouse">Curtain</rs> remained, so it was singled out for demolition

            attempt by the privy council to control the number of active playhouses was made and
            their frustration is apparent:</p>

          <p>It is evident that despite the notional 'decay' of the Rose and official attempts to
            reduce the number of playhouses on Bankside, Henslowe continued to maintain its
            operation regardless of the loss of the lord admiral's men to the fair new Fortune that
            he and Alleyn had opened in 1600. The diary's accounts during this period are quite
            sporadic for the Rose and there is no consistent evidence of residency by a single
            company. On a new folio Henslowe begins to record performances by Pembroke's men, but
            only two entries are made for 28–9 October.<note type="foot">See Foakes,

            company probably disbanded shortly thereafter. The only company known to have used the
            Rose subsequently as their base, for almost a year, was the earl of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/175729/" type="Collective_Troupe">Worcester's men</rs>, recorded in the diary for various loans, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40453/" type="Drama_Type">play</rs>

              Anne</rs> soon thereafter and would move to playhouses north of the river.</p>
          <p>1603 was a year of national crisis. The aging queen's illness raised anxieties early in
            the year. The privy council's order of 19 March for the restraint of stage plays until
            further notice was probably in response.<note type="foot">See <ptr target="#rosep-ridm92828856"/>. See also Leeds Barroll, <title>Politics, Plague, and

              101–2.</note> The queen died a week later and was buried on 28 April so playing may
            have been suspended in deference until after that date. Henslowe noted the suspension of
            play (again) on 5 May 1603 at the time of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/17496/" type="Person_Royalty">King

            Severe plague broke out again across the country in 1603 and deaths in London began to
            rise in May according to surviving records.<note type="foot">See further Barroll,

            does not record the ensuing long closure in his diary but he did make vigorous note of
            his resistance to the proposed rise in the cost of the lease on the Little Rose property
            revealed to him at a meeting on 25 June (see the previous section for the details).</p>
          <p>The diary is silent on any performances offered or companies playing at the Rose after
            Worcester's men departed. The privy council registers are lost for this period, but an
            original copy of the privy council letter on 9 April 1604 to the lord mayor and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/154215/" type="Collective_Office">JPs of Middlesex</rs> and Surrey survives in the Henslowe-Alleyn papers at

          </p>
          <p>Other historical sources indicate that the plague raging in London would have kept the
            playhouses closed until after Lent 1604, and even then the rest of that year was likely
            to have been disrupted by fresh outbreaks.<note type="foot">The original privy council
              registers for 1601/2–13 were destroyed by fire in 1618. However, Barroll,
                <title>Politics, Plague, and Shakespeare’s Theater</title>, pp 104–23, provides a
              detailed outline from other historic sources of the likely impact of the 1603–4 plague
              on Shakespeare's company, the king's men, then resident at the Globe, but all London
              area playhouses would have felt the economic consequences.</note> Given these circumstances we might
            ask whether operations ceased at the Rose entirely by May 1603, given the onset of
            plague in London, Henslowe's other involvements at the Fortune and the Bear Garden, as
            well as practical concerns for the age and looming cost of improving and maintaining the
            Rose playhouse as of Michaelmas 1605 when the original lease on the Little Rose would
            expire. As outlined in the first section above, the Sewer Commission reports for 1605–6
            indicate that Henslowe abandoned the lease and the playhouse; the archaeological
            analysis of the remains in 1989 appear to confirm that it was dismantled around the same
              time.<note type="foot">Bowsher and Miller, <title>Rose and the Globe</title>, pp

            <p> From the reference here to the 'playe howse now in framinge' it is apparent that the

              clear from the description of the '<rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/229110/" type="Place_F_Residence">smalle ten<ex>emen</ex>te or dwellinge howsse</rs> scittuate and standinge at the

              potentially lucrative victualling house for the playhouse. His small building is shown
              on John Norden's maps of 1593 and 1600 in the southwest corner of the Little Rose
              site. For more on the late twentieth-century excavation of the site and Cholmley's
              house, see Bowsher and Miller, <title>Rose and the Globe</title>, pp 24–32, 111.</p>

            <p> Also mentioned in the deed is the builder <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/131126/" type="Person_Commoner">John Griggs</rs>, who was employed again five years later in 1592 to renovate and
              extend the audience capacity of the playhouse. </p>

              William Ingram, 'The Closing of the Theaters in 1597: A Dissenting View,'
                <title>Modern Philology</title> 69.2 (November 1971), 105–15. Glynne Wickham, while
              subscribing to the view that the order should be seen in the context of the
                <title>Isle of Dogs</title> production, has pointed out that the intention of the
              order was essentially a restraint of public performances in <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/36947/" type="Place_PA_Settlement">London</rs> for three months only rather than outright suppression of all theatres.
              In fact playing resumed at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/228083/" type="Place_F_Playhouse">the
                Curtain</rs> and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/157260/" type="Place_F_Playhouse">the Rose</rs> (but not <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/227779/" type="Place_F_Playhouse">the
                Swan</rs>) in October and November 1597. As he notes, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/127834/" type="Collective_Troupe">the Chamberlain's</rs> and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/25827/" type="Collective_Troupe">Admiral's Men</rs> were preparing for performances at Court during the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/41461/" type="CalendarDay_Liturgical">Christmas</rs> season and both enjoyed the patronage
              of members of the Privy Council, so rehearsing for a royal audience would have
              facilitated their return to those two public stages in the autumn. See further 'The
              Privy Council Order of 1597 for the Destruction of all London's Theatres,' <title>The
                Elizabethan Theatre: Papers given at the International Conference on Elizabethan
                Theatre held at the University of Waterloo, Ontario, in July 1968</title>, David
              Galloway (ed) (Toronto, 1969), 21–44. </p>

            <p> In 1589 <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/151032/" type="Person_Commoner">Francis Langley</rs> had acquired the lordship of the manor

By 1595 he had opened a second theatre there, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/227779/" type="Place_F_Playhouse">the
                Swan</rs>, which must have increased the traffic of playgoers across the Thames to

            <p> Most of the plays named in the inventories appear in <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/129736/" type="Person_Commoner">Henslowe</rs>'s diary and have been
              noted from the Foakes edition and, where relevant, the <title><ref target="https://lostplays.folger.edu/">Lost Plays
                Database</ref></title>, Roslyn L. Knutson, David McInnis, and Matthew Steggle (eds). For more details on each, see Appendix 3 and Wiggins and Richardson, <title>British
                Drama</title>, vols 2–4. Very few of those named survive. Wiggins and Richardson's titles have been
              followed for each in the textual notes.</p>

            <p> Carson, <title>Companion</title>, pp 49–50, notes several puzzles presented by this
              document: 'Not the least of these is the identity of the author. The phrase "I have
              bought" sounds suspiciously like Henslowe, and if indeed he is the compiler of the list then the words probably
              mean no more than "have lent the actors to buy". The fact that one of the plays on the
              list <title><rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/239281/" type="Drama_TitledWork">Vayvode</rs></title>, belonged to <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/153045/" type="Person_Commoner">Edward Alleyn</rs> in January 1599 raises the possibility that he may have been the
              "I" in question' (p 49). Carson further outlines other anomalies, such as omission on
              the list of playbooks of some plays known from the diary to have been staged or
              purchased in the same period. Gurr, <title>Shakespeare's Opposites</title>, p 103,
              favours Henslowe as the compiler of the list of plays owned by the company, but with
              the exclusion of those still owned by Alleyn.</p>

              <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/153305/" type="Person_Commoner">Forman</rs> dates the first entry 4 March 1600 but by 4 March 1600/1 <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/25827/" type="Collective_Troupe">the Lord Admiral's Men</rs> had moved from <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/157260/" type="Place_F_Playhouse">the

              indicates that 4 March fell on a Tuesday, as it did in 1599/1600 but not 1600/1 (with
              thanks to Alan H. Nelson for this note and his revision of the date). Rowse,
                <title>Simon Forman</title>, p 15, dated the entry as 4 March but both Cerasano, 'Philip Henslowe, Simon Forman,' p 158, and Lupic, 'Early Performances,' p 99, n 5,
              misread the date as 9 March.</p>

            <p> However, as Lupic points out, the entry for 15 March 1599/1600 indicates that
              Cerasano, p 158, misdates Forman's attendance at the performance of <title>Sir John
                Oldcastle</title> in the following comment: 'On 16 October 1600, in the final
              performances of the Lord Admiral's Men at the Rose, Forman attended <title>Sir John
                Oldcastle</title>, although it is unclear whether Forman saw Part 1 or Part 2 of the
              play.' Lupic, p 99, points out that on '12 March <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/129736/" type="Person_Commoner">Henslowe</rs> made a payment to the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/14062/" type="Collective_Occupation">tailor</rs> for his work relating to the production of
                <title>The Second Part of Sir John Oldcastle</title>. Four days later Forman saw
                <title>Sir John Oldcastle</title>, and given the closeness of these dates the most
              plausible interpretation is that the play Forman saw was indeed the freshly mounted
              second part.' In any case Forman's primary purpose in noting the performance was to
              record the address of a woman he was interested in <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/45689/" type="CrimesMisdemeanors">pursuing for other

              Rose</rs> property on <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/229072/" type="Place_F_Street">Bankside</rs> upon the death of her husband, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/126979/" type="Person_Commoner">Ralph Symonds</rs>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/127051/" type="Collective_Occupation">fishmonger</rs>, and it seems clear that she intended to
            bequeath the property in perpetuity to the charitable uses of her parish. But an ancient
            statute, the Statute of Mortmain,<note type="foot">Properly called the statute 'de
              Religiosis,' enacted by <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/205235/" type="Person_Royalty">Edward I</rs>’s parliament in 1279. See Great Britain,
                <title>The Statutes of the Realm</title>, vol 1 (London, 1810; rpt 1963), 51.</note>
            erected barriers to such an intention. If one wished to leave property to the Church –
            and leaving it to a parish meant leaving it to the Church – one could not do that
            directly because the Statute of Mortmain prohibited it.</p>
          <p>'Mortmain' is the term commonly used to describe property held in perpetuity by any
            entity, but most commonly by the Church. Because the entity never dies such property is
            exempt from inheritance, with its attendant taxes and death duties. Property held in
            mortmain thus represented a lost revenue stream to the Crown, and Edward I hoped to end
            the practice with his statute. But his statute addressed only Church property, and
            clever persons soon realized that property could be held in perpetuity by trustees, or
              feoffees<note type="foot">Feoffee: A person invested with a freehold estate in land,
              that is, with a fief or fee, the freehold estate conveyed by livery of seisin.</note>,
            as easily as by the Church.<note type="foot"> This was, or was perceived to be, a fairly
              large concern. According to the anonymous eighteenth century author of a letter to
              William Pitt, 'one third of the land of this kingdom is vested in mortmain'
                (<title>Three Letters to the Right Hon. Wm. Pitt, on the Subject of the Statutes of
                Mortmain: Containing an Enquiry into the Origin and Present State of the Possessions
                of the Clergy under that Tenure</title> (London, 1795), 2).</note></p>
          <p>So on 3 December 1552 Thomasyn Symonds conveyed to eighteen named persons, whom she
            described in the deed of transfer as her 'feoffees,' the 'mesuage or ten<ex>emen</ex>t
            called the little Roose with two gardeyns to the same adioyning.' The property was
            devised to 'my said feoffes aforenamed &amp; their heires foreu<ex>er</ex>.' And on 22
            December 1552, only three weeks after the enrolling of this deed of gift, Thomasyn’s
            attorney <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/205304/" type="Person_Commoner">Peter Baker</rs> affirmed that he had taken 'full &amp;
            peaseble possession state &amp; season' of the Little Rose property and that he 'did
            giue &amp; deliu<ex>er</ex> the same peasible possession state &amp; season to theise
              p<ex>er</ex>sons hereafter named being the most p<ex>ar</ex>t of the feoffes' named in
            the deed.<note type="foot"> Baker’s affidavit is enrolled with the deed (TNA: C.54/482,
              mb 13).</note></p>
          <p>The documents tell us that some of the feoffees, perhaps the bulk of them, were
            parishioners of St Mildred's, some of them perhaps <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/3576/" type="Collective_ClergyAndChurchwardens"> churchwardens</rs>. But the records of the
            parish do not survive from before the middle of the seventeenth century, so there is no
            way to resolve this issue. All we know is that these eighteen men were charged to use
            the income from the property to perform certain charitable acts. Should those charitable
            acts align with the desires of the parish of St Mildred, so much the better.</p>
          <p>The feoffees’ initial use of the Little Rose property was to lease it to tenants and
            collect the rent. In 1574 the feoffees leased the property for thirty-one years (or
            until 1605) to <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/129508/" type="Person_Commoner">William Griffen</rs>, for £7 per year, and Griffen soon sold
            the lease to <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/126687/" type="Person_Commoner">Robert Withens</rs>, who in turn sold the lease, in 1584/5, to
              <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/129736/" type="Person_Commoner">Philip Henslowe</rs>, who – with twenty years left on the lease – built <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/157260/" type="Place_F_Playhouse"> a
              playhouse</rs> on the property, and continued to pay the annual rent of £7 per year.
            It seemed clear to Henslowe that the rent he paid went to the parish of St Mildred,
            though he must have paid it to the feoffees or their agents as specified in the
              deed.<note type="foot"> 'Pd vnto St mildred<ex>es</ex> – vij li': Foakes and Rickert,
                <title>Henslowe’s Diary</title>, p 246. </note> Such blurring of the presumed and
            the actual was perhaps not uncommon in the period. When the lease expired in 1605,
            Henslowe declined to renew it, perhaps because the new rent would rise to £20 per year,
            plus 100 marks for upkeep.<note type="foot">A '<rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/199666/" type="Person_Commoner">Mr
                Pope</rs>' told Henslowe, at a <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/199711/" type="Collective_Occupation">scrivener</rs>’s shop in 1603, about the new £20 rent,
              showing him 'a wrytynge betwext the pareshe and hime.' Such a writing indicates the
              parish’s role, and suggests that this Mr Pope may have been one of the successor
              feoffees.</note></p>
          <p>The Little Rose reverted to the feoffees, who did not immediately find another person
            wishing to lease the property. In 1606 the presentment jurors of the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/2291/" type="Place_County">Surrey</rs> and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/2039/" type="Place_County">Kent</rs> Commissions of Sewers – who had regularly fined Henslowe

                <p>The meaning of ‘highnoyous’ is not entirely clear, though the bequest for 'the

                  'amending of highnoyous wayes' suggests that 'highnoyous wayes' should be
                  understood as one phrase, and that highways were intended. Bequests for mending of
                  highways were not uncommon in the period; see, for example, the section on
                  ‘Charitable Donations to Infrastructure’ in Susan E. James, <title>Women’s Voices
                    in Tudor Wills, 1485–1603: Authority, Influence and Material Culture</title>

                  its members to be surveyors of highways and collections were taken regularly for
                  mending and repairing the highways of the parish. <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/199852/" type="Person_Commoner">Shakespeare</rs> knew it happened; in <title><rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/237881/" type="Drama_TitledWork">The Merchant of Venice</rs></title>, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/237903/" type="Drama_Character">Graziano</rs> says ‘Why, this is like the mending of
