                <p>Records of Early English Drama (REED) is an international scholarly project that
                    is establishing for the first time the context from which the drama of
                    Shakespeare and his contemporaries grew. Founded in 1976, REED has worked since
                    then to locate, transcribe, and edit historical documents containing evidence of
                    drama, secular music, and other communal entertainment and ceremony from the
                    Middle Ages until 1642, when the Puritans closed the London theatres.</p>

                            including orders for payments, letters, and many other types of official
                            records concerning the running of the vast duchy of Lancaster. Some of
                            the orders are addressed to borough and other local officials within the
                            duchy, and deal with local arrangements. The register books also contain
                            a vast amount of material about the running of Gaunt's various
                            households in England, as far-flung as Bamburgh, Leicester, Kenilworth,
                            Kingston Lacy, Hertford, and the Savoy, as well as others in Europe.
                            Records of his payments for minstrels and other entertainers have been
                            transcribed, wherever activities or payments for them may have occurred,
                            because the administrative centres of the duchy appear to have been
                            Tutbury and Kenilworth. The register books have been published as

                            beginning in 1519, which are in the same hand as entries for the years
                            1611 onwards, so they presumably were copied by the town clerk or his
                            scribe; (b) accounts of bailiffs, chamberlains, churchwardens, and
                            schoolwardens, because the accounts of the minor officials were
                            presented and approved by the corporation officials before being entered
                            into the town book. In the transcriptions, the entries from the
                            churchwardens are differentiated from the bailiffs' (later the mayors')
                            accounts because they originated from different authorities. The
                            churchwardens' accounting year was 21 December–20 December, with the
                            accounts presented to the bailiffs between 13 February and 19 March, the
                            Friday following Quadragesima Sunday. The bailiffs' accounting year was
                            18 October–17 October, with the accounts similarly being presented
                            between 13 February and 19 March. The mayoral accounting year was later
                            adjusted slightly to begin the next Monday after St Luke's Day (ie, 27

                            records concerning the running of the vast duchy of Lancaster. Some of
                            the orders are addressed to borough and other local officials within the
                            duchy, and deal with local arrangements. Two such excerpts deal with
                            Newcastle under Lyme and Tutbury, and hence the register books are fully
                            described above, under those boroughs. The register books also contain a
                            vast amount of material about the running of Gaunt's various households
                            in England, as far-flung as Bamburgh, Leicester, Kenilworth, Kingston
                            Lacy, Hertford, and the Savoy, as well as others in Europe. Records of
                            his payments for minstrels and other entertainers have been transcribed,
                            wherever activities or payments for them may have occurred, because the

                            omissions) of the orders of 1618 (TNA: DL 41/587). Presumably the letter
                            of 7 May 1630, [b], was intended to accompany this version of the
                            orders. It could not have been intended for the orders dated later, the
                            revised orders of 10 May 1630 (1631?), item [c]. These revised orders
                            presumably reflect changes ordered by the new chancellor of the duchy of
                            Lancaster, Edward Barrett, Lord Newburgh, who held office from April
                            1629 concurrently with his predecessor, Sir <rs

                                type="Person_Gentry">Humphrey May</rs>, or perhaps by May himself.
                            May's death in June 1630 likely caused some upheaval in the workings of
                            the Chancery office, and may account for the confusion in dates with
                            this version of the orders. In any case there appears to have been a
                            delay of a little over a year before the revised orders, item [c], were
                            issued, along with item [d], Newburgh's letter of 21 May 1631 ordering
                            that the orders be exemplified and enforced. However, the existence of
                            an exemplification dated 10 May 1630 (1631?) may indicate that
                            Newburgh's letter was related to yet another recension of the orders,
                            now lost. The relationships between these variant versions, one
                            concludes, are not at all clear.</ab>

                            in Staffordshire Record Office for consultation by arrangement. It
                            contains annual churchwardens' accounts, presented usually at Lady Day
                            or Mid-Lent Sunday each year; in most cases the date of presentation
                            specifies the calendar year. This is assumed to have been in Old Style
                            and the year has been corrected accordingly (for example, 1520 has been
                            given as 1520/1). There are several cases in which both the calendar and
                            regnal year are specified; in these the year appears to be given in New
                            Style and has not been corrected. The handwriting, presumably that of
                            the parish clerk, changes several times in the course of the years
                            covered by the document.</ab>

                                ('Corporation of Reading,' pp 167–227). Fourteen rolls before 1413
                                seen by Macray are no longer extant. Those for 1363–4, 1366–7,
                                1367–8, 1378–9, and 1384–5 were used by Norman Gibbs in his Oxford
                                doctoral thesis in 1935. All had disappeared by 1960 (Slade,
                                    <title>Reading Gild Accounts</title>, pt 1, pp xvii–xxii). There
                                has been speculation that the disappearance was as a result of enemy
                                action during the Second World War when Reading, by then an
                                important railway centre, was heavily bombed. Macray does not record
                                the accounting year, but later MS evidence indicates that it was
                                Michaelmas to Michaelmas. </p></note>

                                complains of those across England and especially in Hampshire who
                                cling to Roman Catholicism. Bale focuses on a papist whom he claims
                                talked contemptuously of King Edward on the previous 29 December,
                                among his many offences. Bale received the living of Bishopstoke in
                                Hampshire 26 June 1551, when the strongly Protestant John Ponet (a
                                supporter of Northumberland) was made bishop of Winchester in place
                                of the more moderate Stephen Gardiner (<title>ODNB</title>). King
                                Edward nominated Bale to be bishop of Ossory in October 1552 and he
                                was consecrated in February 1553, so the planned performance of
                                Bale's <title>Three Laws</title> criticized by the papist must have
                                occurred in 1551 or 1552 (<title>ODNB</title>; Happé,
                                    <title>Bale</title>, pp 17–18). Scholars have not been able to
                                identify this papist, as Bale does not name him, nor does Bale
                                identify the 'gentylman af hys owne affynyte' in whose house the
                                papist resided, or the papist's chaplain, who is an 'allyen, an
                                Armoricall or frenche Britayne,' or the servant who was going to act
                                in Bale's <title>Three Laws</title> (Happé, <title>Bale</title>, p
                                42; John Bale, <title>An Expostulation or complaynte agaynste the

                                sigs Bi, Civ). Either Bale assumed Northumberland would know to whom
                                the pamphlet referred, or their identities did not matter to Bale,
                                as the individuals' actions merely provided Bale with an opportunity
                                to express his vitriolic anti- Catholic rhetoric. Hampshire had
                                plenty of Catholic-leaning gentlemen, many of whom would remain
                                recusants through Queen Elizabeth's reign. Moreover, Bale does not
                                make clear whether the play performance was to take place at
                                Bishopstoke, where the bishop of Winchester had a residence, at the
                                bishop's palace at Wolvesey in Winchester, or somewhere else. Thus
                                it is difficult to pinpoint the household of a Catholic gentleman
                                whose servant was to perform in Bale's play.<lb/></p></note>

                            and the Hampshire border with Dorset. The main road from the Dorset
                            coast ran through Ringwood and then crossed the Avon at Fordingbridge,
                            where it met a road coming west from Southampton. The roads thus brought
                            a good deal of traffic through the parish. The parish church is
                            dedicated to St Mary the Virgin.</ab>

                        <ab type="edDesc">The content of this document appears to be a fairly
                            standard churchwardens' account of receipts and expenses. Since there
                            are a number of crossings out and additions, this may be a draft of
                            accounts to be entered in the parish's book of accounts (perhaps the
                            'booke' for which 12d was paid that year). The manuscript is both
                            undated and unlocated, but it comes from the Jervoise of Herriard
                            collection at the Hampshire Record Office. The hand is late sixteenth to
                            early seventeenth century and a note on the verso, 'what I have reseved
                            for the church,' resembles that of Sir Richard Paulet in his
                            'Parliamentary Diary.' The HRO catalogue identifies the church as
                            Herriard's due to the mention of 'S<ex>i</ex>r R<ex>ichard</ex>
                                Paulet<ex>es</ex> shepherd' from whom the churchwardens bought two
                            lambs for their king ale. This account is very similar to HRO:
                            44M69/J9/137, which includes a note by Thomas Jervoise, dated 1606 and
                            titled 'what money ys towardes Herriard Church repairs: 1606.' However,
                            it is possible that the parish involved is St Nicholas,' Freefolk, where
                            Paulet is buried. He held the manor of Freefolk as well as Herriard, and
                            his accounts seem to place him at Freefolk more often than at
                            Herriard.</ab>

                            to have been written at the same time, probably from loose bills. No

                            Titchfield, rose to prominence in the 1520s and 1530s through his

                            Aragon. The king granted Wriothesley the dissolved Premonstratensian
                            abbey of Titchfield in 1537 and he immediately began converting the
                            abbey buildings into his main Hampshire residence, Place House

                        <ab type="edDesc"> Identification of this account is based on a memorandum
                            at the bottom of f 5 in the same hand as the rest of the accounts:
                            'receiued by me Wm Guidott as it appeareth aboue written<gap
                                reason="omitted"/>' and then the amount that 'remaineth dew vnto
                            yourself.' The 'your' is likely Sir Thomas Jervoise, for whom Guidott
                            managed money and legal affairs, but it could also be Roger Tegg, from
                            whom Guidott received funds. William Guidott succeeded James Samborne as
                            steward for Thomas Jervoise. The accounts appear to have been audited by
                            a John Cooper, whose signature appears below this memorandum and
                            elsewhere in the accounts. The accounts are mostly for expenses while
                            away from the main household, at London, Salisbury, and elsewhere. Most
                            of the expenses appear to be Guidott's own, though he also makes
                            payments for 'your' expenses. The accounts run from Michaelmas 1615 to
                            the following Michaelmas, or at least through August.<lb/></ab>

                            the Crown. Paulet had no son and after Jervoise married Paulet's
                            daughter, Lucy, he became Paulet's heir. At Paulet's death in 1614

                            expenses while travelling on business for the Jervoise family. Folio [2]
                            is labelled at the top as Michaelmas term, while f [3v] is labelled
                            Hilary term 1625, in fact taking the account into the first quarter of
                            1626. Folio [3], however, does not carry a date and may be a
                            continuation of the Michaelmas term accounts from f [2], which ends with
                            an entry for horsemeat at Basingstoke on 29 December. However, there is
                            a subtotal at the bottom of f [2] so the entries on f [3] may not be
                            Michaelmas term. Folio [4v] formed the outside when the book was folded
                            like a letter and carries the Herriard Collection stamp and HRO pencil
                            shelfmark. Also, on the outside fold of this leaf is written: '1625 Mr

                            Villiers, (1592–1628)) travelled to Spain in 1623 to try to reach a
                            final agreement on the long anticipated match between Charles and the
                            Spanish Infanta. Charles was in Spain from February to October, but
                            ultimately the agreement fell apart. Sir John Oglander, who was deputy
                            governor of Portsmouth at this time, made a list of the entire party
                            that was sent some time later to attend on Charles in Madrid.</ab>

                        <ab type="edDesc">The document containing the play description comprises
                            miscellaneous records to do with the manor of Hill Croome,
                            Worcestershire, which Richard Paulet had inherited from his great uncle
                            Thomas Walshe in 1593. The manuscript begins with records of the manor
                            court of Hill Croome for 1506 and ends with a 1601 survey of the lands
                            which Paulet's adopted son and heir Thomas Jervoise inherited from his
                            father. The item on f [46v] is a copy of Richard Paulet's 1582
                            recognizance to pay his sister Elizabeth £20 when she comes of age or
                            marries. The manuscript thus seems to be a collection of records
                            concerning Richard Paulet's lands and finances, but the records have
                            been copied by several different hands and are not arranged in
                            chronological order, so they give little indication of the date or
                            origin of the play description. The two different hands of the play
                            description are both late 16th century. The two folios of the play
                            description (ff [12] and [13]) are written upside down in relation to
                            the rest of the manuscript. (f [12v] is written right side up in a
                            different hand from the play description, and is a survey of the manor
                            of Stockton, Worcestershire, which Paulet also inherited from Thomas
                            Walshe.) The list of virtues and vices on f [13] is written in a
                            different hand from the summary on f [12], but the two are linked by the
                            word 'Triumph' at the top of both, and several of the virtues in the
                            list appear in the summary.</ab>

                        <ab type="edDesc">In June 1627 England was making preparations to send a
                            sizeable fleet under the command of the duke of Buckingham to La
                            Rochelle on the French coast, to relieve the Huguenots besieged there by
                            French forces directed by Cardinal Richelieu. On 11 June, the date of
                            this letter, Buckingham was still in London, although King Charles had
                            left for Portsmouth a week earlier to inspect the fleet. Captain Robert
                            Mason, one of the duke's secretaries, thus wrote this letter describing
                            the king's activities at Portsmouth to another of Buckingham's
                            secretaries, Edward Nicholas. The king was accompanied at Portsmouth by
                            a considerable group of nobles, many of whom would be joining Buckingham
                            on the expedition to La Rochelle. Among them was the count of Soubise,
                            one of the leaders of the Huguenot rebellion, who had come to England to
                            plead for the king's aid against Richelieu and Louis XIII. Also in the
                            party were Buckingham's father-in-law, the earl of Rutland; his
                            brother-in-law, the earl of Denbigh; the lord steward, the earl of
                            Pembroke; the lord chamberlain, the earl of Montgomery; and the earl of
                            Carlisle (Roger Lockyer, <title>Buckingham: The Life and Political
                                Career of George Villiers, First Duke of Buckingham
                                1592–1628</title> (London and New York, 1981), 370–5). The king
                            stayed at Southwick House, Sir Daniel Norton's residence a mile north of
                            Portsmouth, but the entertainment provided by Archie the fool and
                            Buckingham's musicians appears to have taken place during a meal on
                            board one of the ships. The fool, Archibald Armstrong, had also
                            accompanied Charles to Portsmouth four years earlier when then Prince
                            Charles embarked for Spain to try to negotiate a Spanish match for
                            himself.</ab>

                            cover of the manuscript are due to the fact that it was originally held
                            in the college library, then was deposited in the Bodleian Library in
                            the 1890s, returned to Corpus Christi in 1984, and then transferred from

                            manuscript as Corpus Christi College MS CCCLXXVI. The manuscript has
                            been a good deal damaged and repaired. Some leaves survive intact, some
                            only damaged at edges, not affecting the written text, but some are very
                            extensively damaged so that only a half to a third of the leaf remains.

                            accounts survive in a fairly orderly chronological run from 1541 to
                            1607, though the accounts for 1553 to 1555 are missing. Then there is a
                            gap until 1619 and from that point the accounts are summary only to
                            1656. At the end of the manuscript is a list of rates for the Holy Loaf

                                Sussex, and Hampshire. In Hampshire it reached only as far west as
                                Southampton and Winchester before curving back east toward
                                Basingstoke, Odiham, and Elvetham, and then returning to the London
                                area by early October. The queen visited, among others, Sir William
                                More (1520–1600) at Loseley on 5–9 August; Anthony Browne (1528–92),
                                1st Viscount Montagu, at Cowdray – where another elaborate
                                entertainment had been performed on 14–20 August; Henry Wriothesley
                                (1573–1624), 4th earl of Southampton, at Titchfield on 2–3
                                September; Sir Henry Wallop (1568–1642) at Farleigh Wallop on 12–13
                                September; William Paulet (1532–98), 3rd marquess of Winchester, at
                                Basing on 13–16 September; and Edward More (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>
                                1555–1623) at Odiham on 19–20 September (Cameron Louis (ed),
                                    <title>Sussex</title>, REED (Toronto and Buffalo, 2000), 188–95;
                                Chambers, <title>Elizabethan Stage</title>, vol 4, pp 105–6). Odiham
                                had long been a royal residence, so the fact that Hertford's small
                                house and lands at Elvetham lay only four miles from Odiham meant
                                Elvetham would have to serve if Hertford were going to have the
                                chance to entertain the queen in 1591. Many of the two hundred
                                artificers employed at Elvetham must have come from Tottenham, as
                                did one Edmund Pike, who wrote the churchwardens of Great Bedwyn,
                                Wiltshire, explaining that he could not meet with them on 25 August
                                1591, as he was aiding his master, the earl of Hertford, with his
                                preparations 'agaynst her ma<ex>ies</ex>ties com<ex>m</ex>ynge to
                                his Lo<ex>rdship</ex> howse at Elvetham' (Wiltshire and Swindon
                                Archives: D5/28/6, f 133).</p><p>A description of the pageantry at
                                Elvetham was entered in the Stationer's Register on 1 October by the
                                printer John Wolfe of London and issued as a quarto pamphlet: 'THE
                                HONORABLE Entertainment gieuen to the Quenes Maiestie in Progresse,
                                at Eluetham in Hampshire, by the right Honorable the Earle of
                                Hertford.' No author is named on the title page, but the description
                                of the events appears to have been written by a member of Hertford's
                                household: he consistently refers to Hertford as 'my Lord' in the
                                first printed version of the text (Q1; see below) and the
                                substantive changes made in the later, corrected printing (Q2)
                                reflect first-hand knowledge of the event. Some of the songs are
                                known from other sources to have been written by Thomas Watson,
                                while the Phyllida and Coridon song is known to be by Nicholas
                                Breton. Earlier editors have offered a number of other names as
                                authors of part or all of the text, but their arguments are highly
                                speculative. Thomas Morley is credited in the text as composer of
                                one of the pavanes performed on the first evening, and William Byrd
                                is among those who may have contributed to the music (Davies,
                                'Queen's Entertainment at Elvetham,' pp 568–9).</p><p> Four copies
                                of the pamphlet have survived. Three copies are similar: BL:
                                C.33.c.7.(9.), Cambridge University Library: Bb.11.50 (E), and
                                Lambeth Palace Library: ZZ.1593.28.97. In his edition of the
                                entertainment for the new edition of Nichols'
                                    <title>Progresses</title>, Davies designates these three copies
                                as Q1 and details the minor differences between them ('Queen's
                                Entertainment at Elvetham,' pp 563–4). The copy in the Royal
                                Collection at Windsor Castle (RCIN 1024755) differs substantially
                                from the other three, so Davies has designated it Q2. The
                                differences suggest that most of Q1 was written before the events it
                                describes, and it represents Hertford's plans for the queen's visit,
                                although it does mention the rain on the second day that delayed and
                                altered some of the planned entertainments. Q2 has been more heavily
                                corrected to represent what actually happened, and adds marginal
                                notes to the description of the fourth day that tell us that the
                                queen displayed great patience in enduring more rain in order to
                                witness the pageantry for her departure. Q2 also adds details in a
                                number of places in the text, though it leaves out one extended
                                description of the third day's banquet that appears in Q1 (which can
                                be found here in the endnote). Q2 also includes a more elaborate
                                version of the foldout illustration of the artificial lake setting
                                for the entertainments than the ones included in the Cambridge and
                                Lambeth copies of Q1.</p><p> The edition of the Elvetham
                                entertainment included by Nichols had many inaccuracies, as he
                                originally based his text on Q1 and then created a composite version
                                after he encountered Q2, which appears in the 1823 edition of
                                Nichols' <title>Progresses</title>. Q2 then disappeared from
                                scholarly view for two centuries, until Davies located it at
                                Windsor. In the interim, scholars used Nichols' botched composite,
                                or attempted to sort out what Q2 must have contained by comparing
                                Nichols' version with one or more copies of Q1. Moreover, the
                                illustration of the artificial lake and other set-pieces included by
                                Nichols and frequently reproduced in theatre histories was not in
                                fact the original foldout woodcut, but an eighteenth-century
                                engraving that adds a conjectural lower section to the Q2
                                illustration (for a fuller analysis of earlier editions of the
                                Elvetham entertainment, see Davies, 'Queen's Entertainment at
                                Elvetham,' pp 562–95.) The edition included here takes Q2 as its
                                copy text throughout, both because it has been corrected and because
                                REED's emphasis is on what was performed, rather than what was
                                originally written. Variant readings in Q1 are given in the textual
                                notes; accidental variants of spelling, punctuation, and typography
                                have been ignored.<lb/></p></note>

                            as far back as the transcriptions of the nineteenth century antiquarian,
                            William Alchin, which he titled the 'Suthwyk Records'(HRO: 4M53/Z2) .
                            The accounting year presumably ran from Michaelmas to Michaelmas, as
                            with all other accounts in this series. This and the other accounts in
                            this series are calendared at the HRO as 'General' accounts, but they
                            were rendered by the bailiff.<lb/></ab>

                            usually found in the stewards' accounts. This terrier is likely to have
                            been drawn up as part of Thomas Overay's reforms of the town's
                            accounting procedures. Such terriers were supposed to be created
                            annually but few have survived and this one was likely written on vellum

                            accounts is on the cover – a paper one probably of nineteenth-century
                            provenance, which gives the date '1579.' None of the entertainers
                            mentioned in this set of steward's accounts appear in the mayor's
                            accounts for 1578–9, while the mayor's accounts for 1579–80 contain no
                            rewards to itinerant entertainers, suggesting that it was the steward
                            who did the rewarding in that year. The responsibility for recording
                            rewards to visiting performers seems to shift back and forth between the

                            particular groups match up across the two sets of accounts. These

                            of handwriting, names of town officials mentioned in the accounts, and
                            sections missing from other account books. The City Archives catalogue

                            records from that period. Some records of the admiralty court from the
                            eighteenth century are also included. In 1491 mayor Thomas Overay
                            instituted extensive reforms in town government, including its
                            accounting practices. For that reason, the borough accounts kept by the
                            stewards were also copied into the Second Book of Remembrance. The
                            accounting year ran from Michaelmas to Michaelmas. Most of the amounts
                            recorded were annual and customary ones paid as wages to the officers of
                            the town, for example, the town clerk, sergeants, and cranemen. The
                            accounts also include amounts spent on liveries and on obits (see Thick,
                                <title>Southampton Steward's Book</title>, pp xvi–xvii.) Possibly
                            the authorities felt the need to record the rewards to minstrels in this
                            year when new ordinances were established in order to set out the
                            traditional practices and amounts involved in receiving visits by such
                            entertainers.</ab>

                            date, which is given as 6 Henry VII. The ordinances which precede these
                            accounts give a date of 1 July, 6 Henry VII, as the date on which the
                            assembly established these ordinances as remedies for the grievous

                            and citizens and foreigners buying and selling in violation of the
                            town's ordinances, as well as admission fees paid by those desiring to
                            practise a craft in the city. These receipts provided the mayor with a
                            small fund from which to pay for rewards to players, messengers,
                            noblemen and their servants, and the like, and occasionally for minor
                            repairs to town buildings. After a few years of accounts the payments
                            also begin to be recorded here, so that in fact the accounts are not
                            just a record of fines, but are the complete mayors' accounts. In the
                            second half of the sixteenth century the accounts, especially the
                            payments, become more detailed and broader in content, including much
                            more extensive expenses for construction and repair, and detailed
                            accounts for poor relief. The accounting year runs from Michaelmas to
                            Michaelmas. The Book of Fines has been transcribed by Butler,

                            (f 147r), following the accounts for 14–15 Elizabeth: there is no set of

                            which is correctly headed 28–9 Elizabeth. (1585–6 is also, incorrectly,
                            labeled 28–9 Elizabeth.) Dates given within the accounts are correct,
                            further revealing the error, as in the accounts for 1576–7, which are
                            headed 19–20 Elizabeth (which would be 1577–8) but twice dated

                            in the First Book of Debts. The first twenty-four leaves contain an
                            alphabetical index of debts. Annual audit accounts begin at f 84 and run
                            to f 241, covering the years 1603 to 1617. The accounts of the auditors
                            cover the whole range of the city's finances, including those recorded
                            in the stewards' accounts and in the mayors' accounts. The accounting
                            year runs from Michaelmas to Michaelmas. For the years 1603 to 1615
                            items of both receipt and expense are each entered twice, once as
                            credits and once as debits, with folio numbers and marginal reference
                            numbers making cross-referencing easy. Many items are entered in great
                            detail – such as rents, scavage receipts, fees and expenses for town
                            officials, loans, and loan payments. Others, however, are not entered in
                            nearly the same detail as in the stewards' and mayors' accounts, notably
                            gifts and rewards, as well as the costs of construction and repairs.
                            Thus some years covered by these accounts that yield no references to
                            itinerant entertainers may have seen visits that were lumped with other
                            gifts and rewards in the audit accounts.<lb/></ab>

                            of apprentices begun at the same time (SC9/2/12), which recorded
                            apprenticeships privately arranged by indenture. The poor apprentices
                            were children of paupers, and often orphans, for whom the parish and
                            town took responsibility, and apprenticing them was seen as a
                            preventative against vagrancy. For further details about the

                            <!-- KC: plague -->at London had kept the king away from London since
                            his accession and in August 1603 the court began a progress from Hampton
                            Court, reaching the marquess of Winchester's residence at Basing House
                            by the seventeenth. A week later the king turned north toward Woodstock,
                            only to find, as Lewknor's letter indicates, that the plague had reached
                            Oxford. The court thus returned to Hampshire, staying in Winchester in
                            early September, while the Spanish delegation lodged at Southampton.
                            According to a journal kept by a secretary to Robert Cecil, the Spanish
                            ambassador's repeated requests to see the king finally led to two
                            audiences with James, held at Windsor on 25 and 28 September. The
                            Spanish delegation still remained at Southampton, as on 30 September
                            Cecil and several other lords went to Southampton to confer with the
                            ambassador there (Howard Vallence Jones (ed), 'The Journal of Levinus

                            or 1525. Other internal evidence indicates that it must refer to Easter
                            1514 (eg the creation of Henry Broke as sub-prior for the first time).
                            As the roll covers the period from Michaelmas to Michaelmas, the date of
                            this roll must be 1513–1514.'</ab>

                            this is the only one that contains records of dramatic and musical
                            activity. Many of the sets of accounts are 'day books' that include only
                            the daily expenditures on food and other consumables, but at least
                            twelve sets of accounts are steward's or minister's accounts similar to

                        <ab type="edDesc">The accounts cover the hospital's receipts, mainly from

                            and Basingstoke. The manor belonged to the Crown and around 1300 was
                            held from the king by Roger de Pedwardyn. The White family came to
                            possess the manor during the reign of Henry VI and held it until it was
                            sold in 1636 to Richard Bishop of London. The church is dedicated to St

                            a year later, and when he would have left college in about 1630, aged
                            18, he was killed by a sword wound, according to Kirby, who gets his
                            information from the original college register (Thomas Frederick Kirby,
                                <title>Winchester Scholars: A List of the Wardens, Fellows, and
                                Scholars of Saint Mary College of Winchester, near Winchester,
                                commonly called Winchester College</title> (London and Winchester,
                            1888), 170). According to the college archivist, a note next to the 1623
                            Longland entry says 'gladio interrumpt' et in claust' sepult',' but
                            there is no date given for his death.</ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc">The authorship of this poem is unclear. All the
                            handwriting in the manuscript, with the exception of the last page,
                            appears to be the same, and the manuscript includes at least one poem
                            attributed to Donne. Others are by Carew, Cleveland, and Beaumont and
                            Fletcher. There are several others signed 'H' and 'HH,' which could be
                            by the writer himself, who appears to have some connection with Oxford,
                            either with Brasenose College or Christ Church but not with New College,
                            as might be expected if there had been any personal connection with
                            Winchester College. The manuscript is undated but Hudson gives the dates
                            as between 1615 and 1640, although the last entry appears to be dated
                            1637 ('Schoolboy Tragedy,' pp 153–4). The poems are copied down at
                            random, not in any date order of the events to which they refer. 'On Dr
                            Dun's Death,' for example, comes earlier in the manuscript than the poem
                            attributed to Donne himself. The poem was written by someone who
                            considered himself a friend and who knew what part Longland took in the
                            performance, so he could well have been a Winchester scholar. Longland
                            did not live long enough to matriculate at Oxford, although his friend
                            may well have done so and have been at New College. Hudson also says
                            that a number of the pieces in the manuscript deal with Winchester
                            College as well as with Oxford, but there is no mention of Winchester at
                            all in the text of this commonplace book.<lb/></ab>

                            later in the bursars' accounts, 'Commons' section. The visitors eating
                            in hall were entered at the end of each week, generally across both
                            columns, under the heading of 'Jurnelli,' that is, guests. The listings
                            start on the left with the day of the week followed by a list of guests,
                            usually without commas or virgules, and then a formulaic entry such as
                            'ad prandium/cenam cum socijs' or 'cum famulis.' Sometimes the visitors
                            were listed as eating at the top table with the warden, sometimes with
                            the junior fellows ('socijs'), and sometimes with the servants
                            ('famulis'). This pecking order gives us some idea of the status
                            accorded to the various sorts of visitors.</ab>

                            sometimes the year the book was started and sometimes when it ended.
                            Sometimes there are two entries in different hands; the lengthier one in
                            Latin appears to be contemporary and the other brief one is in a later
                            hand. Each week starts with a Saturday and is not dated but designated
                            by a heading such as '2nd week, 2nd quarter' and then by the days in
                            Latin. These have been given specific dates with reference to H. Chitty,
                            bursar from the 1910s to 30s, who went to considerable lengths to verify
                            the dates and also to establish dates where no cover has survived,
                            through reference to the corresponding account rolls where they exist or
                            else to lists of scholars/fellows and their dates of admission. The
                            accounting period is usually Michaelmas to Michaelmas and the new year
                            begins with the Saturday following Michaelmas (with one or two
                            exceptions). The quarters are divided into thirteen weeks each, although
                            the fourth quarter sometimes contains a fourteenth week to make the
                            first quarter of the next year start on the Saturday after
                            Michaelmas.<lb/></ab>

                            in hall were entered at the end of each week, generally across both
                            columns, under the heading of 'Jurnelli,' that is, guests. The listings
                            start on the left with the day of the week followed by a list of guests,
                            usually without commas or virgules, and then a formulaic entry such as
                            'ad prandium/cenam cum socijs' or 'cum famulis.' Sometimes the visitors
                            were listed as eating at the top table with the warden, sometimes with
                            the junior fellows ('socijs'), and sometimes with the servants
                            ('famulis'). This pecking order gives us some idea of the status

                        <ab type="edDesc"> There are datings of regnal years on the covers,
                            sometimes the year the book was started and sometimes when it ended.
                            Sometimes there are two entries in different hands; the lengthier one in
                            Latin appears to be contemporary and the other brief one is in a later
                            hand. Each week starts with a Saturday and is not dated but designated
                            by a heading such as '2nd week, 2nd quarter' and then by the days in
                            Latin. These have been given specific dates with reference to H. Chitty,
                            bursar from the 1910s to 30s, who went to considerable lengths to verify
                            the dates and also to establish dates where no cover has survived,
                            through reference to the corresponding account rolls where they exist or

                            trades and conducted other business. From the early fifteenth century

                            case, the details being relegated to slips filed in bundles and known as
                            'recorda.' The pleas are typically dated by the date of the offence
                            rather than the date the plea was entered or the case heard.<lb/></ab>

                            the city, its membership probably identical to the merchant guild's. The

                            and sick of St John's Hospital and on celebrations of Corpus Christi and
                            the Nativity of St John the Baptist. The office of warden of the
                            fraternity was considered an important civic office and the warden was
                            appointed by the mayor. The burghmote, the assembly of freemen, met

                            but developed into an organization including the entire ruling elite of
                            the city, its membership probably identical to the merchant guild's. The
                            fraternity's activities focused on contributing to the care of the poor
                            and sick of St John's Hospital and on celebrations of Corpus Christi and
                            the Nativity of St John the Baptist. The office of warden of the
                            fraternity was considered an important civic office and the warden was
                            appointed by the mayor. The burghmote, the assembly of freemen, met
                            three times a year in the hall of St John's Hospital rather than in the
                            guildhall, and in the fifteenth century the city's deeds and other
                            records were kept in a chest there (Keene and Rumble, <title>Survey of

                        <ab type="edDesc">The ordinance books contain ordinances such as election of
                            officials, granting of leases, and regulations to do with trade and
                            health. Also included are elections to membership of the Merchants'
                            guild and incorporation of various other guilds, such as the
                            Fishmongers' and the Tailors' and Hosiers'. These books can be seen as
                            the official register of decisions made at the general assemblies, the
                            borough motes, held twice a year in either the guildhall or in St John's
                            House and attended by the mayor, the twenty-four, other freemen of the
                            Merchants' guild, and – supposedly – the commonalty, although it is
                            doubtful whether the ordinary citizen had any formal say by this date or
                            was even present, whatever may have been the case earlier (Keene,
                                <title>Survey of Winchester in the Late Middle Ages</title>, 75–82;
                            Furley, <title>City Government</title>, 62–9). Many are ratifications of
                            decisions already made at the more frequent meetings of the mayor and
                            his brethren and initially recorded in the Proceedings Books. The first
                            book includes the queen's proclamation concerning the fate of Mary Queen
                            of Scots and regulations, dated 16 October 1561, concerning the wearing
                            of scarlet gowns by mayors, ex-mayors, and their wives, and the days on
                            which they are to be worn. As the ordinances were amended or cancelled a
                            marginal entry to that effect has been added.</ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc">On f 99 there is an ordinance dated 7 November 1552 that

                            ordinance books) that the mayor and the twenty-four considered still
                            valid should be translated into English and bound into a new paper book.

                        <ab type="edDesc">In one of the Coffer Account Books (W/E6/1), on f [66v],
                            dated 5 September 1591, there are two references to orders agreed 'in
                            the booke of reme<ex>m</ex>braunce.' Since most payments from the city
                            coffers were authorized by orders recorded in the Proceedings Books and
                            no Books of Remembrance are listed in the HRO catalogue, it has been
                            necessary to undertake a lengthy investigation to discover what and
                            where these Books of Remembrance might be. Alderman Jacob on p 4 of Top
                            Win 3/2 (one of his scrapbooks of press cuttings) refers to 'Old records
                                <gap reason="omitted"/> Coffer, sessional and Remembrance.' Further,
                            in an article on Elizabethan trade, 'A Glimpse at Trade in Winton in
                            Queen Elizabeth's Reign,' <title>Hampshire Notes and Queries</title> 4
                            (1889), 40–1, he quotes from 'a curious book: "The remembrance of
                            thinges agreed in the Council House"' (p 40). From the records he quotes
                            it has been possible to trace this book to what the HRO catalogue calls
                            'Proceedings Book A' (W/B2/2), which was rebound in the early part of
                            the twentieth century and has the title on its cover, 'Proceedings of
                            the Corporation.' From this evidence it was established that the orders
                            'in the booke of reme<ex>m</ex>braunce' referred to in the Coffer
                            Account Book and quoted above are at f 10v and f 11 of the HRO's
                            Proceedings Book A and that therefore the Proceedings Books were
                            originally known as Books of Remembrance. It appears that the original
                            title must have been lost at the time of rebinding. The city archivist
                            has now amended the HRO catalogue description to reflect these findings,
                            although the books will not be renamed because of the number of
                            references to them in printed sources.</ab>

                        </msIdentifier>
                        <ab type="edDesc">Lancelot Thorpe was town clerk of Winchester and in 1615
                            and 1623 mayor as well (Tom Atkinson, <title>Elizabethan
                                Winchester</title> (London, 1963), 91). The fact that Thorpe was
                            re-elected mayor in 1623 suggests that his fellows on the council did
                            not think him the demon that Coleman did. Coleman's complaint accuses
                            Thorpe of a number of abuses while mayor, among them refusing Coleman
                            entry into the twenty-four for no reason and showing a malicious hatred
                            of Coleman. The charge given the most space is that several men were
                            brought before Thorpe as justice of the town court, accused of running
                            tippling houses without licences, and that Thorpe not only <rs
                                ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/173156/"
                                type="CrimesMisdemeanors">did not punish them but gave them licences
                                to continue</rs>. Coleman adds that these men were suspected of
                            keeping unruly houses and being receivers of stolen goods. The crucial
                            point, though, is that all the accused brewed their <rs
                                ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/40997/"
                                type="Thing_FoodDrink">ale</rs> from grain milled at mills owned by
                            Thorpe, whereas none of the previously licensed alehouse keepers used
                            either of Thorpe's two mills. Coleman argues that the result has been
                            considerable economic loss to other mill owners. Coleman also accuses
                            Thorpe of failing to collect fines from other offenders, fines that
                            should have gone to Coleman and others, letting the offenders go
                            unpunished, as in the case of the players. For another attempt to
                            suppress games, dancing, and the like in the Soke, see the quarter

                            city coffer, the city's depository for its treasures, which was kept in
                            the council house. Each entry is signed by the mayor of the time and by
                            those of his brethren who were present. All 'paid in' entries are bound
                            into the books before all 'taken out' entries. In August 1590 the
                            council house was entered and the locked settle in which the coffer was
                            kept was broken into. The coffer, several silver seals, the city's seal,
                            coin to the value of £80, and plate, bonds, and stock, '&amp; the bookes
                            of accompte,' were stolen. So a new Coffer Account Book had to be
                            started and the first few pages contain a summary of debts owed by
                            various citizens to the coffer and other important financial information

                            plate, bonds and stock, '&amp; the bookes of accompte' were stolen. So a
                            new Coffer Account Book had to be started and the first few pages

                            in Trussell's own hand, are dated between 1617 and 1647 except for a
                            list of mayors dated 1648–56 in a different hand, so the compilation may
                            have been made by someone else, after Trussell's death in

                            election of officials, granting of leases, and (again) regulations to do
                            with trade and health. These books also include elections to membership
                            of the Merchants' guild and incorporation of various other guilds, such
                            as the Fishmongers' and the Tailors' and Hosiers'. These books can be
                            seen as the official register of decisions made at the general
                            assemblies, the boroughmotes, held twice a year in either the guildhall
                            or in St John's House and attended by the mayor, the twenty-four, other
                            freemen of the Merchants' guild and – supposedly – the commonalty,
                            although it is doubtful whether the ordinary citizen had any formal say
                            by this date or was even present, whatever may have been the case
                            earlier. Many are ratifications of decisions already made at the more
                            frequent meetings of the mayor and his brethren and initially recorded
                            in the Proceedings Books. As the ordinances were amended or cancelled a

                            That makes it especially remarkable that St John's continued to hold

                            the original accounts to have been lost and so used an
                            eighteenth-century transcript, but the manuscript was found and is now

                            The accounts run from 1548 to 1596, after which there is a gap until a
                            single year's account dated 19 January 1605/6. The accounting period
                            varies, sometimes covering two or three years, and usually beginning in
                            early January, though the date ranges from 29 December to as late as 24

                        <ab type="edDesc">The accounts were at first rendered in November, on 2
                            November and, later, the 17th. In 1595 they moved to 10 January and then
                            to 14 March 1596, 12 March 1597, 14 March 1600 and 1601, 3 April 1602,
                            and 18 March 1603. After that the particular day was no longer recorded.
                            All Saints' Day remained (or returned to being) an important accounting
                            day, because a memorandum of 1613 indicates that anyone holding any of
                            the church stock must on All Saints' Day produce either the stock or a
                            pledge for its security. The churchwardens did not try to balance their
                            budget each year but would allow the church stock to decrease until they
                            felt it needed a boost: the first rate was collected in 1610, when there
                            had been no ale or other big money maker for five years. Other rates
                            followed in 1616, 1619, 1623, 1625, 1635, 1636, 1637, 1638, and 1640 –
                            suggesting that in the late 1630s they decided to make the rate an
                            annual one, as it became after the Restoration.</ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc">Bound inside the manuscript are two leaves of parchment

                            fragments of a fourteenth-century manuscript of a philosophical treatise
                            in Latin. In a blank space on the dorse of the last parchment leaf is

                            Commissioners of Sewers were issued in 1554. Its minutes begin in 1570
                            and it was the earliest of the London Commissions to be established on
                            an organised basis. The area of its jurisdiction ran from East Molesey
                            in Surrey to the River Ravensbourne, and included Lambeth, Southwark,
                            Bermondsey, Newington, Deptford, Rotherhithe, Clapham, Battersea,
                            Camberwell, Vauxhall, Wandsworth, Putney, Barnes, Kew, Lewisham,
                            Walworth, Kennington, Nine Elms, Peckham and New Cross. The area of
                            jurisdiction remained the same throughout the three centuries during

                        <note type="edDesc"><p>The original inventories were first discovered in 'a
                                bundle of loose papers,' presumably at Dulwich College, by Edmond
                                Malone, who published his transcription in 1790 ('Rise and
                                Progress,' pp 289, 300–7), subsequently reprinted from Malone by
                                various successors including Foakes, <title>Henslowe's
                                Diary</title>, Appendix 2. The manuscript original has not yet
                                surfaced so Malone's transcript has been used as the source here
                                also. Others who have quoted Malone, notably Greg, <title>Henslowe
                                    Papers</title>, pp 113–23, have provided conjectural notes and
                                identifications for props and titles included in the inventories;
                                these are noted below only where some certainty exists. Malone
                                glossed some words in square brackets embedded in the text; these
                                are not included in this transcription.<lb/><lb/> A second inventory
                                of theatrical apparel survives in the original, tentatively dated
                                    <hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1601/2 and therefore related to the

                                    <title>Henslowe Papers</title>, pp 52–5. The date given in the
                                transcription here places the inventories into the period when the
                                Admiral's Men were either resident at the <rs ref="eats:157260"
                                    type="Place_F_Playhouse">Rose</rs> on Bankside or on the road in
                                the provinces. They did not relocate to the new Fortune playhouse
                                north of the Thames until 1600.<lb/><lb/> While comparing the
                                details in the inventories with the loan accounts and the diary
                                itself, Neil Carson has suggested that the inventories were only a
                                partial list of the company's resources (<title>Companion</title>,
                                pp 49–53). Although ownership is not expressed and the handwriting
                                of the compiler cannot be examined, Carson deduces that by 'whomever
                                compiled, however, the inventory is most probably (like the
                                companion inventories of properties and costumes) a list belonging
                                to the players' of the Admiral's company (<title>Companion</title>,
                                p 49).</p></note>

                            in 1639 he refused to pay ship money. As a result, he was dismissed from
                            his posts and was called before the Council of State; the king
                            reportedly told him that if he interfered again he would hang him. In
                            April 1640 Cholmley was again elected MP for Scarborough in the Short
                            Parliament. He was re-elected for Scarborough for the Long Parliament in
                            November 1640 and was created a baronet in 1641, but was prevented from
                            sitting in 1643. His memoirs are – as per the title-page of the

                            growth. Chaloner's interests as a naturalist led him to collect
                            information on local customs as well. His correspondent, 'H. Tr.' (f

                            1468–1500, the great hall of the Bishop's Palace was constructed at the
                            west end of the cathedral. The prior's house – now the 'Eighth Canonry'
                            – located at the southwest end of the cathedral nave, was built in the
                            twelfth century, but renovated through the thirteenth and fourteenth
                            centuries. Between the prior's personal house and the cathedral, there
                            are two halls, the prior's great hall and the cathedral great hall. The
                            prior's house had also a study and a kitchen, which joined the house to
                            the Ely Cathedral guest house. Finally, to the west of the prior's house
                            is the Queen's hall, built about 1330 for the reception of <rs

                                Arundel</rs> (1353–1414), was the third son of Richard Fitzalan (<hi

                            earl of Surrey, and Eleanor (d. 1372), daughter of Henry (<hi
                                rend="italic">c</hi> 1280–1345), second earl of Lancaster. At the
                            age of seventeen Arundel received his first benefice in Taunton,
                            Somerset, and was raised to the bishopric of Ely at the age of twenty,
                            on 13 August 1373. During the same time (perhaps about 1369) he began
                            his career at Oriel College, Oxford, leaving after his BA. Arundel's
                            political career is best defined by his actions as lord chancellor,
                            1386–9 and 1391–6, in which role he mediated disputes between his older
                            brother, <rs ref="eats:131276" type="Person_Nobility">Richard</rs>
                            (1346–1397), the fifteenth earl of Arundel, and King <rs

                            deposition in favour of Henry IV in 1399. Arundel's political actions
                            led to subsequent ecclesiastical appointments. On 3 April 1388 Arundel
                            was translated to the archbishopric of York, and on 25 September 1396 to
                            the archbishopric of Canterbury. Arundel was subsequently replaced by
                            Roger Walden (d. 1406) in 1397, after which he was exiled and fled to
                            Florence. In 1398 Boniface IX translated Arundel to the bishopric of St
                            Andrew's; following Walden's deposition in 1399 by <rs ref="eats:32283"
                                type="Person_Male">Henry IV</rs>, Arundel was restored to
                            Canterbury, where he remained until his death on 19 February 1413/14.
                            Throughout his ecclesiastical career, Arundel was dedicated to pastoral
                            reform, acting when bishop of Ely as patron to a number of northern
                            clergy, including Richard Scrope (<hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1350–1405),
                            future archbishop of York, John Neuton (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>
                            1350–14), who became treasurer of York Minster, Henry Bowet (d. 1423),
                            also later an archbishop of York, and Augustinian mystic Walter Hilton
                                (<hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1342–96), all of whom were employed in the
                            Ely consistory court. Another mystic, Nicholas Love (d. 1424), wrote his
                                <title> Myrrour of the Blessed Lyf of Jesu Christ</title> and
                            presented it to Arundel, as archbishop of Canterbury, in 1411. Arundel's
                            patronage was designed to combat Lollardry, which was just beginning to
                            develop in the 1380s; indeed, Richard II's visit to King's Hall,
                            Cambridge, when Arundel was raised to the bishopric of Ely may have been
                            intended to combat heresy at the college (Jonathan Hughes, 'Arundel

                            Ely as a seeming reward for diplomatic services from 1502 to 1515. He
                            served as bishop for eighteen years, the first decade of his episcopate
                            marked by continued work within the government, including ambassadorial
                            work in France and an attendance at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. West
                            was also closely involved in addressing heterodoxy at the University of
                            Cambridge – most notably in an excommunication of the University Senate
                            for opposing his jurisdictional authority in the late 1520s – a result
                            perhaps of earlier confrontations with Hugh Latimer, whose Lutheran
                            sympathies led him to preach against the worldliness of prelates. His
                            position as chaplain to <rs ref="eats:138362" type="Person_Royalty"

                            the last years of his life. West was one of only three bishops to give
                            assent to the submission of the clergy in May 1532; nonetheless,
                            Katherine's retirement from London to his house in Hatfield indicates
                            their continued close relationship. An inventory at his death revealed a

                            collection and produced the first extant inventory of books in the
                            library, compiled in a register of benefactors (Kari Anne Rand,

                            During this time Wren also compiled a list of estate papers for the

                            Philip III's daughter, Maria Anna. Wren would later accompany Charles
                            for his coronation in Edinburgh in 1633. In 1625 Wren again turned to
                            historical record-keeping as master of Peterhouse, producing 'an
                            inventory for the treasury of the medieval college <gap reason="omitted"

                            Wren's archival work continued as dean of Windsor in 1628, bishop of
                            Hereford in 1634, bishop of Norwich in 1635, and finally bishop of Ely
                            in 1638. As bishop of Norwich and Ely, Wren also undertook a series of
                            visitations to ensure conformity, an effort curtailed in 1641 when he
                            was imprisoned in the Tower of London, where he stayed until 1660

                                (1553–1624), painter-stainer of St Peter Westcheap, and Susan,

                                July 1608. He was junior and senior treasurer, 1610 and 1611
                                respectively, and bursar of the college, 1621–4. In 1615 he was

                                In 1635 he became bishop of Norwich, at which time he started work
                                on reform. In May 1638 he was sent to Ely and immediately sent out
                                his bill of inquiry, with the goal of ridding the county of
                                Puritanism, and the response was strong. On 27 December 1640 Wren

                                released on 15 March 1660. His final years marked a return to
                                administration in Ely; after his death on 24 April 1667, he was
                                buried in Pembroke College on 11 May 1667 (Nicholas W.S. Cranfield,

                            Henslowe, and her daughters, Mary Moushurst and Elizabeth Moushurst. The
                            defendants answered on 7 June; see <ref

                        <ab type="edDesc"> In his bill Meade claimed that William had leased the

                            that William had bound himself in the sum of £500 promising quiet
                            enjoyment of the properties, including from suits in law that might be
                            raised by Edward Alleyn and John Henslowe. Meade had therefore, he said,
                            spent £400 on improvements to the Bear Garden. The defendants were not
                            prepared to stand by this bond. </ab>

                            Garden had been assigned to them in November 1622 by William in return
                            for £280, a loan, and board and lodging. </ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> Edward Alleyn gave no answer but entered a plea and
                            demurrer on 29 June 1624 challenging the bill on the grounds that a
                            related case in the Exchequer court, brought by the Attorney General
                            against Meade and William Henslowe, was as yet undetermined; see <ref

                            associated with the Whitefriars playhouse, and then in 1614 with some
                            players from Prince Charles' (formerly the Duke of York's) Men. The

                            played at the Hope forty weeks until Henslowe "broke" them in February
                            1615. Hence they began at the Hope in the spring of 1614'; see

                            Henslowe's widow Agnes, and Roger Cole. He had charged them with
                            bringing undue influence to bear on Philip while he was drawing up his
                            will, thus invalidating it, and with misrepresenting the value of his

                        <ab type="edDesc"> Henslowe, in part on the advice of Alleyn, had chosen
                            Robert Bromfield as one of his overseers along with William Austen, and
                            Roger Cole. All three had been vestrymen and churchwardens at St
                            Saviour's over the decade prior to Henslowe's death, as had Edward
                            Alleyn, so this was a circle of men who carried some prestige in the
                            parish and who knew each other well. Another deponent, Edward Ferrers,
                            mercer, was an old friend of Henslowe. Both he and Bromfield served as
                            MPs, Ferrers for Tewkesbury in 1610 and Bromfield for Southwark in 1621

                            in the operation of the Bear Garden. Edward Griffin had also been a
                            fellow-vestryman, and with John Picket and Randall Wood was involved in
                            appraising Henslowe's goods and chattels and leases after his death. </ab>

                                playhouse at the Hope on Bankside. The details of the terms are
                                illuminating. Dawes had previously been a member of Prince Charles'

                                >Appendix 4: V</ref>. The bishop charged Alleyn and Meade with
                            encroaching upon the bishopric's property, and of concealing leases and
                            other evidences that would clarify the situation. Alleyn denied this,
                            claiming the leases and indentures were with the Courts. He laid out how
                            he and Philip Henslowe came to acquire leases of both the Barge, Bell
                            and Cock property, and of some Crown lands adjoining from Burnaby in the
                            mid-1590s, paying due rent for both and, supported by the testimony of
                            Jacob Meade, insisted that the Bear Garden, constructed as the dual
                            purpose Hope theatre and baiting ring was erected on Crown property. </ab>

                        <ab type="edDesc"> From 1610-11 Henslowe apparently made no monetary payment
                            towards the £8 annual rent of the Fortune playhouse north of the city in
                            Finsbury, as agreed for his share in the property. Instead he allowed
                            Alleyn and his servants residence in a messuage or tenement on part of
                            the Bear Garden. As Wallace notes, the lease itself has not been found
                            in the Dulwich College Archive ('Three London Theatres,' p 51). However,
                            after Agnes Henslowe's death in around April 1617, William Henslowe
                            inherited the lease of the Bear Garden and thus sought to deny Alleyn
                            access to the property. Alleyn and William struggled for control from
                            1617 to 1624, when William died. </ab>

                        <ab type="edDesc">In this case of 1584, Edward Bowes launched a countersuit
                            against John Digges and John Gape in the court of Requests regarding who
                            was the rightful lessee of the Bear Garden on the Barge, Bell and Cock
                            property. Edward Wistowe, after leasing the property from William Payne
                            in 1572–3, had in 1578 assigned it to grocer John Napton. Napton, in
                            serious financial difficulties, in March 1578-9 assigned it to his
                            creditors Digges and Gape, and then in December 1579 to another
                            creditor, the goldsmith Morgan Pope. Pope and Edward Bowes (a brother of
                            Ralph Bowes, then <rs ref="eats:160515" type="Collective_Office">Master
                                of Bears</rs>) and William Glover began games there. Digges and Gape
                            then brought suits against Bowes and Glover, possibly initially in the
                            Southwark Assizes and in the King's Bench. From there the case was taken
                            to the court of Requests. It seems the court's decision was in favour of
                            Pope and Bowes, or there was a settlement, as between 1585–90 Pope
                            retained control of the Bear Garden. </ab>

                        <note type="edDesc"><p>John Stow (1525–1605) was one of England's best-known
                                contemporary historians and chroniclers. According to C.L.
                                Kingsford, he was 'the first English historian to make systematic
                                use of the Public Records for the purpose of his work'; see
                                    <title>English Historical Literature in the Fifteenth
                                    Century</title> (Oxford, 1913), 266. He had an extensive
                                collection of medieval and renaissance manuscripts, many now
                                included in the Harley collection at the British Library. His
                                    <title>Annales of England</title> was first published in 1592
                                    (<title>STC</title>: 23334), covering English history from the
                                earliest times to Elizabeth's reign. Several more continuations
                                followed, Stow's final edition appearing in 1605
                                (<title>STC</title>: 23337).<lb/><lb/> The chronicler <rs

                                    of the English Chronicle</title> (1607). He published his first
                                continuation of the <title>Annales</title> in 1615
                                    (<title>STC</title>: 23338), including his earliest account of
                                the burning of the Globe. The final version of the
                                    <title>Annales</title> was published in 1632
                                (<title>STC</title>: 23340), updating his account of playhouses in
                                London. See further Christian DeCoursey, 'Howes, Edmund (fl.

                            Payne for ninety-nine years by Bishop Stephen Gardiner. Payne held the
                            head lease of the property for the following thirty-five years. By this
                            counterpart indenture of April 1575, Joan Payne, recently widowed, was
                            by this time resident in Ibworth, Hampshire, and had administration of
                            her husband's estate. By this deed she assigned to her son-in-law,
                            Thomas Warram, her daughter, Margery and her grand-daughter Elizabeth,
                            the head lease of the Barge, Bell and Cock property; see the <ref

                            forty-four, and so the players were at liberty to perform again from the

                            important civil functions of the parish. The act for the relief of the
                            poor enacted in 1597 established the administration of poor relief at
                            the parish level by overseers of the poor drawn from vestry. St
                            Saviour's had four, which seems to have been the standard; see Paul A.

                            had commissioned work previously from the carpenter, Peter Street
                            (1553-1609), when the Fortune playhouse was constructed in Finsbury; see
                            Contract for the Fortune Playhouse, <ref

                                >DC: Mun 22</ref>, 8 January 1599/1600. The new building was to be
                            the same size as the previous one at 56 ft x 16 ft with two storeys of
                            10 ft high and a smaller storey 4 foot high. Our research indicates that
                            this building became known as the <rs ref="eats:237532"
                                type="Place_F_VictuallingHouse">Dancing Bears</rs> and included a
                            gateway to the Bear Garden, which opened on to a courtyard beyond which
                            was the arena.</ab>

                            included a tenement for the bearward and an office for Henslowe and
                            Alleyn, but the authors determine that 'the greater portion of the
                            gatehouse proper, with its ample, well-lit spaces, was devoted to the
                            purposes of a taphouse' to serve the needs of the Bear Garden audiences;

                                    Stow</rs> (1525–1605) was one of England's best-known
                                contemporary historians and chroniclers. According to C.L.
                                Kingsford, he was 'the first English historian to make systematic
                                use of the Public Records for the purpose of his work'; see
                                    <title>English Historical Literature in the Fifteenth
                                    Century</title> (Oxford, 1913), p 266. He had an extensive
                                collection of medieval and renaissance manuscripts, many now
                                included in the Harley collection at the British Library.<lb/>
                                <lb/> The <title>Survay of London</title> was first published in
                                1598 but enjoyed a long publishing history. As Barrett L. Beer
                                observes: '[t]he book is a topographical survey of the city and its
                                suburbs developed along the lines of earlier works by John Leland,
                                William Lambarde, and William Camden. In its composition Stow drew
                                on a wide range of classical and medieval historical literature,
                                public and civic records, as well as upon his own intimate personal
                                knowledge of the city where he spent his life. The reader of
                                    <title>A Survey</title> travels with Stow through each of the
                                city's wards and the adjoining city of Westminster, learns about the
                                wall, bridges, gates, and parish churches of London, and peruses
                                lists of <rs ref="eats:87782" type="Collective_Office">mayors</rs>
                                and <rs ref="eats:142952" type="Collective_Office">sheriffs</rs>';

                                accessed 21 December 2022.<lb/>
                                <lb/> The passage on the bear gardens appears in the section on
                                London's Bridge Ward Without among the list of notable houses on the
                                west bank, though the liberty of the Clink lay outside the
                                jurisdiction of the city. There seems no doubt that Stow's
                                description is primarily about the Bear Garden at the Bell and Cock,
                                also known as Payne's Standings, most probably the only one still
                                operating in the 1580s.<lb/>
                                <lb/> Kingsford edited the second edition of Stow's
                                    <title>Survey</title> published in 1603 as 'the only full and
                                authoritative' version (<title>Survey of London</title>, vol 1, p
                                xli) but only minor variations in spelling and phrasing occur in the
                                section on the bear gardens, so the earliest available edition
                                published in 1598 is used here. <lb/><lb/>

                                >LA online catalogue</ref> succinctly describes the sewer records as
                            follows: 'Early Commissioners of Sewers were solely concerned with land
                            drainage and the prevention of flooding, not with the removal of sewage
                            in the modern sense. In 1531 an Act of Sewers was passed which set out
                            in great detail the duties and powers of Commissioners and governed
                            their work until the 19th century. Gradually a permanent pattern emerged
                            in the London area of seven commissions, five north and two south of the
                            Thames, with, after the Great Fire, a separate commission for the City
                            of London<gap reason="omitted"/> Letters Patent for the Surrey and Kent
                            Commissioners of Sewers were issued in 1554. Its minutes begin in 1570
                            and it was the earliest of the London Commissions to be established on
                            an organised basis. The area of its jurisdiction ran from East Molesey
                            in Surrey to the River Ravensbourne, and included Lambeth, Southwark,
                            Bermondsey, Newington, Deptford, Rotherhithe, Clapham, Battersea,
                            Camberwell, Vauxhall, Wandsworth, Putney, Barnes, Kew, Lewisham,
                            Walworth, Kennington, Nine Elms, Peckham and New Cross. The area of
                            jurisdiction remained the same throughout the three centuries during
                            which it functioned.' See further Ida Darlington, 'The London

                            provides an important clue. Field (1587-1619/20) was an actor and
                            playwright, first surfacing on record as a boy actor with the Children
                            of the Chapel Royal at Blackfriars playhouse, London (1600-8). His
                            second acting company, the <rs ref="eats:356261"
                                type="Collective_Troupe">Children of the Queen's Revels</rs>, merged
                            with Lady Elizabeth's Men by 1613; see <ref

                            agreement, with Field as a principal, is most likely sometime during
                            1613-14. By November 1616 Field had left the company to join the <rs

                                passage of time, he became, according to Patrick Collinson, 'the
                                linchpin of a precociously organized presbyterian movement which
                                threatened the Church of England with a revolution which would have

                                Field's 'A godly exhortation,' together with many other puritan
                                tracts of the period, was published by Robert Waldegrave, 'the
                                puritan printer <hi rend="italic">par excellence</hi>' (Collinson,
                                'John Field,' p 353). As with other accounts of this 1583 accident
                                at 'Paris Garden' there seems no doubt that the reference is not to
                                a site in the manor of Paris Garden but rather to the arena known as
                                'Payne's Standings' on the Bell and Cock property. Field provides
                                the fullest description of the disaster and his list of victims is
                                an indication of the type of audience drawn from various parts of
                                London and its northern suburbs to this Bankside location. He
                                extends his disapproval to the northern playhouses of the Theatre
                                and the Curtain outside the city walls but does not mention the only
                                playhouse presumably still functioning south of the river at
                                Newington Butts. </p><lb/></note>

                                As a poet, pamphleteer and polemicist (as well as a Thames
                                waterman), Taylor produced numerous and varied publications over his
                                adult lifetime. Bernard Capp comments: 'Like most writers, Taylor
                                never achieved the recognition he thought his due. Having
                                successfully constructed a comic persona as the rhyming waterman, it
                                was an impossible challenge to be accepted as a serious poet<gap
                                    reason="omitted"/>. Taylor pursued a successful literary career
                                for over fifty years, demonstrating a remarkable range, facility,
                                and inventiveness. He played a pioneering role in the development of
                                nonsense verse, popular political journalism, and travel writing<gap
                                    reason="omitted"/>. The travel writings, like almost everything
                                he published in both verse and prose, had a strongly
                                autobiographical dimension, and they provide a vivid picture of a
                                bluff, shrewd, convivial man, with an appetite for life that won him
                                friends across the political spectrum'; see 'Taylor, John [called
                                the Water Poet] (1578–1653),' <title>ODNB</title>, accessed 19
                                December 2022). <lb/><lb/> William Fennor (b. <hi rend="italic"
                                    >c</hi> 1562), Taylor's opponent in the flyting contest at the
                                Hope, was a minor English poet and former soldier in the Dutch army.
                                Although he styled himself 'his Maiesties Ryming Poet,' it seems
                                unlikely that he was attached to the Jacobean court. For more

                                <lb/><lb/> Richard Preiss has analyzed the rivalry of the two
                                contestants, the 'quasi-theatrical form' of such trials of wit, and
                                the metamorphosis of the aborted event to 'a half- performed,
                                half-literary object that cycles through multiple paratheatrical
                                identities, illuminating along the way the plasticity of early
                                modern playing and its contiguity with the wider landscape of London
                                popular entertainment'; see further 'John Taylor, William Fennor,

                            (bap. 1594, d. 1673), master of the Revels, 1623-73, who purchased the

                            following his death, his records were kept at his family estate at
                            Ribbesford, near Bewdley, Worcestershire. Edmond Malone published many
                            records from the office book in his edition of <title>The Plays and
                                Poems of William Shakespeare</title> (1790), and more extracts were
                            included by George Chalmers in <title>An Apology for the Believers in
                                the Shakespeare-Papers</title> (1797) and <title>A Supplemental
                                Apology</title> (1799). In 1818 Rebecca Warner published her
                                <title>Epistolary Curiosities</title>, which included a few entries
                            from the office book, but subsequently all trace of the office book was
                            lost. However, as N.W. Bawcutt has noted, 'in 1880 J.O.
                            Halliwell-Phillipps announced that he possessed a "partial transcript"
                            of the office-book, although he never published his transcript or showed
                            it to anyone else. Eventually it became clear that the manuscript had
                            been written by the antiquarian Craven Ord (1756–1832) and that
                            Halliwell-Phillipps did not preserve it as a whole but cut out extracts
                            from it and gummed the strips of paper into notebooks that are now in
                            the Folger Shakespeare Library'; see 'Craven Ord Transcripts,' p 84. As
                            a result, the entries below are quoted from one of Halliwell-Phillipps'

                            carpenter Gilbert Katherens to demolish the Bear Garden and erect on the

                            the Swan playhouse. Jacob Meade or Maide (1557–1624) was a waterman
                            based in Southwark and worked closely with Henslowe as his deputy in the

                            follows: 'Early Commissioners of Sewers were solely concerned with land
                            drainage and the prevention of flooding, not with the removal of sewage
                            in the modern sense. In 1531 an Act of Sewers was passed which set out
                            in great detail the duties and powers of Commissioners and governed
                            their work until the 19th century. Gradually a permanent pattern emerged
                            in the London area of seven commissions, five north and two south of the
                            Thames, with, after the Great Fire, a separate commission for the City
                            of London<gap reason="omitted"/> Letters Patent for the Surrey and Kent
                            Commissioners of Sewers were issued in 1554. Its minutes begin in 1570
                            and it was the earliest of the London Commissions to be established on
                            an organised basis. The area of its jurisdiction ran from East Molesey
                            in Surrey to the River Ravensbourne, and included Lambeth, Southwark,
                            Bermondsey, Newington, Deptford, Rotherhithe, Clapham, Battersea,
                            Camberwell, Vauxhall, Wandsworth, Putney, Barnes, Kew, Lewisham,
                            Walworth, Kennington, Nine Elms, Peckham and New Cross. The area of
                            jurisdiction remained the same throughout the three centuries during
                            which it functioned.' See further Ida Darlington, 'The London

                            of the royal court and current gossip. Chamberlain (1553–1628) lived in

                                >LA online catalogue</ref> succinctly describes the sewer records as
                            follows: 'Early Commissioners of Sewers were solely concerned with land
                            drainage and the prevention of flooding, not with the removal of sewage
                            in the modern sense. In 1531 an Act of Sewers was passed which set out
                            in great detail the duties and powers of Commissioners and governed
                            their work until the 19th century. Gradually a permanent pattern emerged
                            in the London area of seven commissions, five north and two south of the
                            Thames, with, after the Great Fire, a separate commission for the City
                            of London<gap reason="omitted"/> Letters Patent for the Surrey and Kent
                            Commissioners of Sewers were issued in 1554. Its minutes begin in 1570
                            and it was the earliest of the London Commissions to be established on
                            an organised basis. The area of its jurisdiction ran from East Molesey
                            in Surrey to the River Ravensbourne, and included Lambeth, Southwark,
                            Bermondsey, Newington, Deptford, Rotherhithe, Clapham, Battersea,
                            Camberwell, Vauxhall, Wandsworth, Putney, Barnes, Kew, Lewisham,
                            Walworth, Kennington, Nine Elms, Peckham and New Cross. The area of
                            jurisdiction remained the same throughout the three centuries during
                            which it functioned.' See further Ida Darlington, 'The London

                            his son, Charles. James Davies was first appointed to share the

                        <ab type="edDesc"> The subject of the suit was the transfer of the lease for
                            the Bear Garden property under <rs ref="eats:24537"
                                type="Person_Royalty">Charles I</rs>, though a previous lease
                            granted by <rs ref="eats:17496" type="Person_Male">James I</rs> had some
                            years still to run. Davies sought the return to himself of the Bear
                            Garden property in St Saviour's parish, for his son's use after the
                            Restoration but the property was claimed by Sydenham, according to a
                            lease granted him by Charles I for a considerable sum for reversion of
                            the lease and of the property and tenements. Both defendants denied any
                            agreement made with Davies for return of the property despite any
                            buildings he may have erected meanwhile. Davies reported that he was
                            granted a lease of three score years by the king in consideration of his
                            costs in rebuilding and more, but Sydenham claimed that Charles I
                            granted him a lease of several tenements on Bankside, including the Bear
                            Garden, though the king had been deceived in doing so.</ab>

                            and Mastiff Dogs by 1638/9. The defendants named in the case included
                            Thomas Davies and Thomas Manley who were appointed joint masters of the
                            Bears, Bulls and Mastiff Dogs on 9 February 1638/9 by Charles I (but see

                            named). James Davies, Thomas' son, was appointed master of the Bears,

                            Thomas Davies in particular. Specific details about the cost of his
                            annual license as deputy, his annual rent at the Bear Garden and the
                            expenses for maintaining his stock of bears, bulls and mastiff dogs are
                            relevant for the period before the closing which led to a two and a half
                            years of suspended activity before baiting was allowed to resume.</ab>

                                1655, when Hugh Browker's son Thomas and his wife sold it to William

                                kingdom of Eutopia, but the parallels are obvious with the life of
                                Elizabeth Holland and her enterprise in Paris Garden. Intriguingly,
                                the timing of the pamphlet's publication coincided with the
                                performance of a play with the same title during the same
                                twelve-month period. <lb/> Dean Stanton Barnard Jr suggests that the
                                main purpose of the pamphlet is 'to present a parable of the Church

                        <ab type="edDesc">The village of Rickinghall lies on the main Bury to
                            Norwich road six miles southwest of Diss and three miles south of the
                            Norfolk border in Blackbourn Hundred. The village is divided by its main
                            street into Rickinghall Inferior and Rickinghall Superior. Until 1938,
                            the two communities were separate parishes. The medieval manor of
                            Rickinghall Inferior, to which our document belonged, was held by the
                            abbot of Bury St Edmunds. In 1544 the manor of Rickinghall Inferior was
                            granted by Henry VIII to Sir Nicholas Bacon of Redgrave Hall. In 1568/9
                            the manor of Rickinghall Superior (named Facon Hall) was held by Anthony
                            Yaxley. By 1609 it had come into the possession of Sir Nicholas Bacon.
                            In the early twentieth century the court roll bearing the play fragment
                            made its way, along with a number and assortment of other documents from
                            the Bacon collection, to the British Library in 1921. However, the great
                            majority (some 4,500) of the Bacon manorial records, plus assorted other
                            documents from Redgrave Hall made their way to the University of Chicago
                            Library in 1924. The sale of the massive Bacon collection was made by
                            the Holt-Wilson family, which had inherited Redgrave in advance of the
                            Law of Property Act of 1924 (see Birch, <title> Ancient Sites</title>,

                            starting at the foot, written in a fourteenth century cursive hand. For
                            a discussion and transcription of part of the manorial court roll (BL:
                            Add. Roll 63481B) to which this play extract is attached, see Miyoshi,
                            'Inheritance Cases.' This study is BL: Department Pamphlet 2469.
                            Miyoshi's monograph transcribes the section of Part A from October 1368
                            to June 1370 on pp 116–18, but does not include the lines from the play. </ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> For a transcription and discussion of this fragment, see
                            Gilson, 'Fourteenth Century Fragment,' pp 340-1. Thomson,
                                <title>Archives</title>, pp 106–7, concludes that these lines are
                            'the beginning of a miracle play.' Based on 'traces of sewing' and the
                            'neat 14th-cent. cursive' hand in which the extract is written, Thomson
                            argues that the page was 'originally a page of a very small book,
                            probably for a player to learn his lines from, which was dismembered for
                            note-paper.' For a facsimile of this membrane (play side) see Davis,

                            the abbey's dissolution in 1539, the rich collection of manuscripts in
                            its library, and the many documents in its archives 'were very quickly
                            scattered' (Thomson, <title>Archives</title>, pp 1–2). Over the course
                            of centuries, many of the manuscripts made their way from private hands
                            into great libraries and record offices. Similarly, charters, bulls,
                            registers and many other major documents also made their eventual way

                        <ab type="edDesc"> However, until recent times, families who had become
                            lords of the former abbey manors retained and carefully preserved the
                            abundant manorial court and account rolls of the abbey, because of their
                            obvious continuing financial and proprietary relevance to those lords.
                            By far the largest of those collections was owned by Sir Nicholas Bacon,
                            to whom the king had granted ownership of the abbey's extraordinarily
                            valuable manors. The collection now resides in the University of Chicago
                            library. </ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> The financial accounts of abbey officials received much
                            less care. The reason for that neglect, as Thomson suggests, is that
                            with the Dissolution, the accounts of officials lost all fiscal
                            relevance (Thomson, <title>Archives</title>, p 4). In any event, only
                            twenty-seven accounts made by officials (of which this roll is one)
                            survive. They were made by eight of the abbey's highest officers (the
                            abbot, cellarer, chamberlain, feretrar, hosteler, prior, sacrist, and
                            warden of the Lady Chapel), and they are preserved at six repositories:
                            the British Library, Bodleian Library, The National Archives, the
                            Suffolk Archives at Bury and Ipswich, and the University of Chicago
                            Library. Thomson identifies twenty-six accounts in five repositories,
                            but overlooks an account at the Suffolk Archives, Ipswich (see Thomson,
                                <title>Archives</title>, pp 69-70). </ab>

                            abbey household account roll (probably a cellarer's account). As
                            described in the British Library Catalogue of Royal Manuscripts, the
                            treatises are ‘a fragment of a civil-law treatise based on the

                            Peñaforte, General of the Dominicans 1238-1240 (d. 1275)’; and ‘Part of
                            a <title>Summa Titulorum Decretium</title>,’ compiled ca. 1215, thought
                            to be the work of Damasus the Bohemian, and described as ‘a revision of
                            the <title>Summa</title> of Bernard of Pavia.’</ab>

                            celebrated at York and the payment given to the king's herald just
                            before a tournament at Newmarket. Parliament was convened at York in two
                            successive years (on 1 May 1335 and on 11 March 1335/6); and a
                            tournament was held at Newmarket in 1334. Thus the account appears most
                            likely to have been made in 1335–6.</ab>

                        <ab type="edDesc"> Bury St Edmunds had six medieval hospitals (dedicated to
                            St John, St Petronilla, St Nicholas, St Peter, St Stephen, and St
                            Saviour), all of them dependent on the abbey and all of them established
                            between the twelfth and early fourteenth centuries. Each had a master or
                            warden who was responsible for administering the life of the hospital
                            and was answerable to the hospitaller of the abbey. Hospitals in Bury,
                            as elsewhere, offered rudimentary care to the indigent, the aged, and
                            the infirm, but historically they also acted as guesthouses, offering
                            hospitality to 'occasional travelers' and to members of the religious
                            community who needed them. In fact, they acted more like 'the modern
                            almshouse' than what we think of as hospitals, their inhabitants and
                            visitors alike participating in the traditional life of a religious
                            community (Joy Rowe, 'The Medieval Hospitals of Bury St Edmunds,'

                            Hospital, Thomas Guatsale, exemplifies the most evolved kind of medieval
                            hospital. Founded, with considerable endowment, in <hi rend="italic"
                                >c</hi> 1184 by Abbot Samson, by charter it originally provided
                            relief to the poor; its membership at the outset included twelve needy
                            men and twelve needy women. But through time it came to serve members of
                            the monastic community and pensioners who could pay, as a place of
                            retirement - in effect an almshouse - and, as Rowe puts it, 'a highly
                            organized free chapel' ('Medieval Hospitals,' p 260). With its
                            ever-growing endowments and estates, the hospital in fact eventually
                            became an institution able to provide life-long food, lodging, clothing,
                            library, recreation, and other services; indeed it served as a monastic
                            household in its own right in service to the abbot and his monastery,
                            the mother house of Bury St Edmunds. Its chartered obligation to provide
                            recreation might explain the payments in this account to 'various
                            players and entertainers' (Rowe, 'Medieval Hospitals,' pp 259-61).</ab>

                            of Claydon in 1535), located about four miles northwest from the centre
                            of Ipswich. Its now-redundant church of St Mary is the small,
                            fourteenth-century structure, parts of which date from 1066. Akenham has
                            always been a tiny place, with a population of thirty tax-paying adults
                            in 1603, but it seems to have had some strategic value. It had four
                            manors in 1086, eventually reduced to the manor of Akenham ('anciently
                            held by the Brewse family') and two sub-manors. John Aylmer (1521–94),
                            bishop of London and tutor to Lady Jane Grey, was born and raised in
                            Akenham Hall (see Goult, <title>East Suffolk</title>, np; and Birch,

                            Maypole. In so doing, it confirms the presence of the custom of a May
                            game in Akenham. A pightle is 'a small angular enclosed piece of ground'

                            With that same definition, Yaxley cites a document made in 1587 (without
                            citing the location or document number of the document) in which a
                            'pixhtell' was of sufficient size that it could be leased. Nothing else
                            is known about the custom in Akenham but in having a site with glebe
                            lands dedicated to recreation, Akenham is similar to a great many

                            Saints Peter and Paul, and a chapel dedicated to Mary at Haselwood. The
                            church is built near the site of what some sources speculate may have
                            been a Saxon church. Its tower dates from the early fourteenth century
                            and the rest of the church dates from the early sixteenth century.
                            (Winn, <title>Records</title>, pp 1, 3–4). As described by Pevsner, the
                            church sits 'on a hill outside the old town' on Victoria Street, ‘the
                            rising street along which the church and the churchyard lie’ which
                            diverges from the High Street, to make its way up the hill. The church
                            is 'quite large' with a 'spacious interior,' although it is not nearly
                            as large as some of the biggest churches in coastal Suffolk (<title>
                                Buildings of England: Suffolk</title>, pp 71–2). Processions from
                            church to Moot Hall (the usual circuit) would have had to travelled down

                        <ab type="edDesc">The Tasburgh family (formerly of Tasburgh, Norfolk and of
                            Norwich) began its confirmable association with South Elmham and
                            Flixton, Suffolk, in the fifteenth century when John Tasburgh I (d.
                            1473) married Margery (d. 1485) of South Elmham, thought to have been an
                            heiress of the Toll family, thereby receiving the Toll Estate at South
                            Elmham and residing in St Peter's Hall (see Nesta Evans, 'The Tasburghs
                            of South Elmham: the Rise and Fall of a Suffolk Gentry Family,'
                                <title>Proceedings of the Suffolk Institute of Archaeology</title>
                            34 (1980), 269–80). His son, John Tasburgh II (d. 1509) became a notable
                            public figure with London connections, whom the records show to have
                            been a successful businessman and a benefactor to religious
                            establishments, including Flixton Priory (Evans, 'Tasburghs,' pp
                            269–70). His eldest son, John Tasburgh III (d. 1552), advanced the
                            family's fortunes significantly. Personally, he was an escheator, a
                            commissioner for sewers, a probable armiger, and a major landowner. Most
                            notably, he acquired the manor of Flixton late Priory in 1544, making
                            him owner of both Flixton manors. Sometime in the 1540's, he moved his
                            family from St Peter's Hall in South Elmham to Flixton Abbey, and
                            thereafter to Flixton Hall (Evans, 'Tasburghs,' p 270). Sir John
                            Tasburgh IV (1533–1607) became lord of the manor of Flixton late Priory
                            by 1565, following the settling of protracted disputes with his
                            stepmother Elizabeth (Tasburgh) Moone. He appears to have had mental
                            difficulties, and by 1597, he had conveyed his estates at Flixton,
                            Bungay, and South Elmham, and control of his finances, to his son and
                            heir <rs ref="eats:449942" type="Person_Male">John Tasburgh V</rs>
                            (1576–1629), who is the John Tasburgh of these accounts (1594–1618). </ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> John Tasburgh V was appointed JP for Suffolk on 3 March
                            1601/2, and was knighted by James I in May 1603. At this point, as Evans
                            puts it: 'The Tasburghs belonged to that quarter of the Suffolk gentry
                            that could be described as rich.' Sir John had landed estates in
                            Flixton, Bungay, and South Elmham St Peter and St Margaret, and a
                            mansion house at Flixton. He was the largest landowner in South Elmham
                            and also had a house in Norwich. The lordship of John Tasburgh, as Evans
                            puts it, saw both the peak of the Tasburgh fortunes and the beginning of
                            their decline. The cause was not economic misadventure but the resolute,
                            enduring recusancy of the family, notably that of Lettice, wife of Sir
                            John, and their recurring punishments by the authorities. The long
                            decline of the family continued until 1736, when the last male Tasburgh
                            died and their holdings (and records) passed through a succession of
                            families, resting finally with the Adairs (Evans, 'Tasburghs,' pp
                            275–9). </ab>

                            village of Flixton on the banks of the River Waveney three miles
                            southwest of Bungay, was the seat of the Tasburgh family. It is
                            uncertain whether Flixton Hall was built by Sir John Tasburgh or by his
                            father, John Tasburgh IV, and whether it was new or rebuilt from an
                            earlier dwelling known as the Bateman House. Though in the Elizabethan
                            style, it dated from either 1615 or 1616. Its interior was entirely
                            destroyed by a fire on 13 December 1846 and thereafter the house was
                            rebuilt by its owners, the Adairs. Unfortunately, it was then demolished
                            in 1950 (Birch, <title>Ancient Sites</title>, p 132).</ab>

                            Norwich) began its confirmable association with South Elmham and
                            Flixton, Suffolk, in the fifteenth century when John Tasburgh I (d.
                            1473) married Margery (d. 1485) of South Elmham, thought to have been an
                            heiress of the Toll family, thereby receiving the Toll Estate at South
                            Elmham and residing in St Peter's Hall (see Nesta Evans, 'The Tasburghs
                            of South Elmham: the Rise and Fall of a Suffolk Gentry Family,'

                            34 (1980), 269–80). His son, John Tasburgh II (d. 1509) became a notable
                            public figure with London connections, whom the records show to have
                            been a successful businessman and a benefactor to religious
                            establishments, including Flixton Priory (Evans, 'Tasburghs,' pp
                            269–70). His eldest son, John Tasburgh III (d. 1552), advanced the
                            family's fortunes significantly. Personally, he was an escheator, a
                            commissioner for sewers, a probable armiger, and a major landowner. Most
                            notably, he acquired the manor of Flixton late Priory in 1544, making
                            him owner of both Flixton manors. Sometime in the 1540's, he moved his
                            family from St Peter's Hall in South Elmham to Flixton Abbey, and
                            thereafter to Flixton Hall (Evans, 'Tasburghs,' p 270). Sir John
                            Tasburgh IV (1533–1607) became was lord of the manor of Flixton late
                            Priory by 1565, following the settling of protracted disputes with his
                            stepmother Elizabeth (Tasburgh) Moone. He appears to have had mental
                            difficulties, and by 1597, he had conveyed his estates at Flixton,
                            Bungay, and South Elmham, and control of his finances, to his son and

                            1601/2, and was knighted by James I in May 1603. At this point, as Evans
                            puts it: 'The Tasburghs belonged to that quarter of the Suffolk gentry
                            that could be described as rich.' Sir John had landed estates in
                            Flixton, Bungay, and South Elmham St Peter and St Margaret, and a
                            mansion house at Flixton. He was the largest landowner in South Elmham
                            and also had a house in Norwich. The lordship of John Tasburgh, as Evans
                            puts it, saw both the peak of the Tasburgh fortunes and the beginning of
                            their decline. The cause was not economic misadventure but the resolute,
                            enduring recusancy of the family, notably that of Lettice, wife of Sir
                            John, and their recurring punishments by the authorities. The long
                            decline of the family continued until 1736, when the last male Tasburgh
                            died and their holdings (and records) passed through a succession of
                            families, resting finally with the Adairs (Evans, 'Tasburghs,' pp

                            public figure with London connections, whom the records show to have
                            been a successful businessman and a benefactor to religious

                            stepmother Elizabeth (Tasburgh) Moone. He appears to have had mental
                            difficulties, and by 1597, he had conveyed his estates at Flixton,
                            Bungay, and South Elmham, and control of his finances, to his son and

                            (1576–1629), who is the John Tasburgh of these accounts (1594–1618). </ab>

                            1601/2, and was knighted by James I in May 1603. At this point, as Evans
                            puts it: 'The Tasburghs belonged to that quarter of the Suffolk gentry
                            that could be described as rich.' Sir John had landed estates in
                            Flixton, Bungay, and South Elmham St Peter and St Margaret, and a
                            mansion house at Flixton. He was the largest landowner in South Elmham
                            and also had a house in Norwich. The lordship of John Tasburgh, as Evans
                            puts it, saw both the peak of the Tasburgh fortunes and the beginning of
                            their decline. The cause was not economic misadventure but the resolute,
                            enduring recusancy of the family, notably that of Lettice, wife of Sir
                            John, and their recurring punishments by the authorities. The long
                            decline of the family continued until 1736, when the last male Tasburgh
                            died and their holdings (and records) passed through a succession of
                            families, resting finally with the Adairs (Evans, 'Tasburghs,' pp

                            Priory by 1565, following the settling of protracted disputes with his
                            stepmother Elizabeth (Tasburgh) Moone. He appears to have had mental
                            difficulties, and by 1597, he had conveyed his estates at Flixton,
                            Bungay, and South Elmham, and control of his finances, to his son and
                            heir <rs ref="eats:449942" type="Person_Male">John Tasburgh V</rs>
                            (1576–1629), who is the John Tasburgh of these accounts (1594–1618). </ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> John Tasburgh V was appointed JP for Suffolk on 3 March
                            1601/2, and was knighted by James I in May 1603. At this point, as Evans
                            puts it: 'The Tasburghs belonged to that quarter of the Suffolk gentry
                            that could be described as rich.' Sir John had landed estates in
                            Flixton, Bungay, and South Elmham St Peter and St Margaret, and a
                            mansion house at Flixton. He was the largest landowner in South Elmham
                            and also had a house in Norwich. The lordship of John Tasburgh, as Evans
                            puts it, saw both the peak of the Tasburgh fortunes and the beginning of
                            their decline. The cause was not economic misadventure but the resolute,
                            enduring recusancy of the family, notably that of Lettice, wife of Sir
                            John, and their recurring punishments by the authorities. The long
                            decline of the family continued until 1736, when the last male Tasburgh
                            died and their holdings (and records) passed through a succession of
                            families, resting finally with the Adairs (Evans, 'Tasburghs,' pp
                            275–9). </ab>

                            earlier dwelling known as the Bateman House. Though in the Elizabethan
                            style, it dated from either 1615 or 1616. Its interior was entirely

                            father of Sir Francis Bacon. At the dissolution the elder Bacon had
                            acquired a vast number of lands and properties in Suffolk, Norfolk,
                            Essex, Somerset, Hertfordshire, London, and elsewhere. The estate
                            further increased with the marriage of Sir Nicholas Bacon II (<hi

                            concern Bacon's formerly monastic holdings in East Anglia and London,
                            but the collection also includes correspondence of Sir Edmund Bacon (son
                            of the younger Sir Nicholas) and the papers of Sir Robert Drury. The Sir
                            Robert Drury of this inventory, was a gentleman of the Privy Chamber in
                            1605, a JP for Suffolk from 1606 until his death in 1615, and an MP in
                            1604 and 1614. He was also a notable courtier and diplomat who sometimes
                            encountered controversy (for example suspicions surrounding his
                            association with the earl of Essex). Most enduringly, Drury was the
                            friend and patron of poet John Donne, who lived in the Drury residence
                            for five years; with whom Drury travelled for a year in Europe in
                            1611–12, and who wrote two poems to Drury's daughter, Elizabeth, upon
                            her death at age fourteen in 1610. </ab>

                        </msIdentifier>
                        <ab type="edDesc">Sir Edmund Bacon (<hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1569–1649),
                            second Baronet of Redgrave, Suffolk, was the eldest son of Sir Nicholas
                            Bacon, first Baronet of Redgrave, and Anne Butts Bacon. Largely, it is
                            said, through the influence of his family, Sir Edmund became MP for Eye,
                            Suffok in 1588–9 and MP for Suffolk in 1593 and 1625. He was high
                            sheriff of Suffolk in 1634. Sir Edmund married Philippa Wotton, daughter
                            of the first Baron Wotton of Marley, whose family seat was Boughton
                            Malherbe, Kent, but the couple had no children. Sir Edmund Bacon was
                            succeeded as Baronet of Redgrave by his younger brother, Robert. The
                            Abraham Viell who wrote this letter was, as the wording of the letter
                            clearly shows, a member of Baronet Bacon's household staff. </ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> The Suffolk village of Redgrave lies just south of the
                            River Waveney (which forms the border with Norfolk) and seven miles from
                            the Suffolk town of Eye. The village itself descended from Redgrave
                            Manor and Redgrave Hall, seat of the Bacon family from 1542 through
                            1702. Redgrave Hall was 'built in 1545, remodelled in 1763, and mostly
                            pulled down in 1946 (the rest since)' by its then owner, the Holt-Wilson
                            family. It stood on the site of an earlier hall (Birch, <title> Ancient
                                Sites</title>, p 315). </ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> In 1924 the Holt-Wilson family, which then owned the Sir
                            Nicholas Bacon manuscripts, put the huge collection up for sale with
                            Bernard Quaritch, Ltd, a London book-seller. At the urging of Professor
                            C.R. Baskerville, the University of Chicago agreed to purchase the
                            collection with funds provided by Martin A. Ryerson, and with assistance
                            from University of Chicago professors John M. Manly, Edith Rickert, and
                            Lillian Redstone. The collection arrived at the University of Chicago
                            Library in 1924 (see <title>Guide</title>, p 3).</ab>

                            (or Maulden) lived in a five-room house in Bildeston, Suffolk. The
                            Bildeston Parish Register describes him as 'John Maulden <hi
                                rend="italic">alias</hi> Barber' (Bury, Suffolk Archives: FB
                            79/D1/1), although the content of his inventory makes clear that he had
                            dual trades, as a weaver and a barber. His inventory describes his
                            weaving-shop, wool, 'wheel spindles,' cloth, two looms and warpings, in
                            addition to other weaving equipment. But it also includes pots, kettle,
                            scissors, razors, comb, two glasses and '5 cases for a barber.'
                            Interestingly, his inventory also lists sixty-seven volumes called
                            'books.' Given their average value of 2.4d, Dymond speculates that they
                            may have been 'chapbooks of stories and ballads' ('Three Entertainers
                            from Tudor Suffolk,' p 3). Mauldon's nuncupative will (Suffolk Archives,
                            Bury: IC 500/1/37 (67)) mentions his wife but no children, and offers no
                            details about his life, nor does it mention the morris dancing apparel
                            and implements. He apparently grew ill suddenly and spoke that will as
                            deathbed words.</ab>

                        <ab type="edDesc">TNA: STAC 8/127/13 is a composite document made up of
                            three items numbered 1, 4A, and 5. The bill of complaint in this case is
                            missing, but since the answer by Leese is responding to the charges in
                            the bill, it provides a good sense of what must have been the general
                            features of the bill.</ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> In his answer to the plaintiff's bill of complaint, Leese
                            identifies as a cobbler and a trumpeter who had served the late Queen
                            Elizabeth on her ships at sea as a trumpeter and, as he describes it,
                            was hired to blow his trumpet at harvest time to encourage harvesters in
                            their work, as was usual at harvest time many places in the county (STAC
                            8/127/13, no 5). Lease and the defendant William Fyner were described by
                            Leese as being shoemakers in Colchester who knew each other. No
                            substantial details about the plaintiff's identity have come to light
                            except that he lived in Bradford and claimed right to the corn then
                            growing in a close at Bradford, and that when the group from Colchester
                            came at night to cut, take, and hide the corn, he summoned a justice of
                            the peace and officers who confronted those doing the 'harvesting' (STAC
                            8/127/13, no 4A).</ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> This incident appears to have been a mock muster, a piece
                            of street or field theatre in which a group of men, and sometimes women,
                            armed with pitchforks, pikes, swords, and other tools or devices so as
                            to imitate an actual muster, processed to a piece of land or a dwelling,
                            seizing the land or its crops and/or livestock. They were often led by
                            trumpeters, pipers and/or drummers. While skimmingtons, which mock
                            musters resemble, intended to unfold as a form of village social justice
                            that was comic in the eyes of the perpetrators, mock musters (though
                            also symbolic performances) had more to do with legalistic and financial
                            conflicts, often reflecting explosive religious and societal conflicts
                            between the early sixteenth and the mid-seventeenth centuries. Both mock
                            musters and skimmingtons could turn dark. See James Stokes (ed),

                            1484–1545), first duke of Suffolk, to Thomas Cromwell (1485–1540),
                            chancellor of the Exchequer, 1533-40, and lord privy seal 1536-40,
                            concerning potentially seditious plays and players in Suffolk. Henry
                            VIII's break with Rome, executed under the leadership of Thomas
                            Cromwell, had created an explosive political and religious atmosphere in
                            Suffolk during the 1530's. As the King's most senior representative in
                            Suffolk itself, Charles Brandon bore responsibility for detecting and
                            suppressing protest, conspiracy, and insurrection agains the royal
                            agenda, whatever form it took. The dangers to the Crown were real. The
                            Lincolnshire Rising had broken out in Louth a year earlier, on 1 October
                            1536. It was followed by the Pilgrimage of Grace later in October 1536,
                            which was a huge conservative insurrection by some 40,000 people in
                            Yorkshire and other places in the northeast part of the kingdom. Suffolk
                            itself had been a centre of proto-Protestant unrest since the fourteenth
                            century, and in this part of the sixteenth century the countryside and
                            towns of Suffolk were filled with whisperings, fiery rhetoric,
                            sermonizing, and polemical drama.</ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> Brandon affirmed to Cromwell that Mr Wharton, comptroller
                            of the duke of Norfolk and bailiff of Bungay had reported that on May
                            Day 1536, a play (also called a May game) had been performed. However,
                            as written by Brandon, the report does not say that the play was
                            performed in Bungay. While Bungay churchwardens' accounts include
                            copious evidence that plays (also called games) were performed together
                            with church ales in Bungay, none of those performances or ales occurred
                            on May Day as part of May games.</ab>

                            Exchequer, 1533–40, and lord privy seal, 1536–40, concerning potentially
                            seditious plays and players in Suffolk. Henry VIII's break with Rome,
                            executed under the leadership of Thomas Cromwell, had created an
                            explosive political and religious atmosphere in Suffolk during the
                            1530's. As the king's most senior representative in Suffolk itself,
                            Charles Brandon bore responsibility for detecting and suppressing

                            form it took. The dangers to the Crown were real. The Lincolnshire
                            Rising had broken out in Louth a year earlier, on 1 October 1536. It was
                            followed by the Pilgrimage of Grace later in October 1536, which was a
                            huge conservative insurrection by some 40,000 people in Yorkshire and
                            other places in the Northeast part of the kingdom. Suffolk itelf had
                            been a centre of proto-Protestant unrest since the fourteenth century,
                            and in this part of the sixteenth century the countryside and towns of
                            Suffolk were filled with whisperings, fiery rhetoric, sermonizing, and
                            polemical drama. </ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> In his cover letter, Brandon affirmed to Cromwell that Mr
                            Wharton, comptroller of the duke of Norfolk and bailiff of Bungay had
                            reported that on May Day 1536, a play (also called a May game) had been
                            performed. However, as written by Brandon, the report does not say that
                            the play was performed in Bungay. While Bungay churchwardens' accounts
                            include copious evidence that plays (also called games) were performed
                            together with church ales in Bungay, none of those performances or ales
                            occurred on May Day as part of May games.</ab>

                        <ab type="edDesc">Bungay lies six miles west of Beccles at a looping bend in
                            the River Waveney that makes the town nearly an island. At the Conquest,
                            William awarded the lordship of the manor of Bungay Burgh to Roger
                            Bigod, which lordship passed through his descendants (until the line
                            died out), then to the Mowbrays, and finally tothe Howards (dukes of
                            Norfolk), where it remains today. Historically, the reeve (known as the
                            Prime Feoffee) led a group of twenty-four elected feoffees (also known
                            as trustees) who governed the town. The reeve (representing the duke)
                            and feoffees alone conducted local governance in Bungay until 1910, when
                            the Urban District Council (superceded by the Waveney District Council
                            in 1974) was formed. Its ten members and the twenty-four feoffees now
                            jointly govern the town (see Birch, <title>Ancient Sites</title>, pp
                            60–3, and Goult, <title>East Suffolk</title>, np).</ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc">As local lords, the dukes of Norfolk were always a
                            dominating presence, claiming income from the mint, the fishery, the
                            bridge, and use of the River Waveney between Beccles and Bungay. The
                            records do not confirm the presence of tensions between the lord and the
                            townsmen concerning control of the town, but a strong element of
                            Wycliffite sympathy reemerged in the town in the late fifteenth century,
                            as did drama of protest in the early sixteenth century (Blackwood,
                                <title>Tudor and Stuart Suffolk</title>, pp 21, 69-70, 95; Dymond
                            and Northeast, <title>History of Suffok</title>, p 58). </ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> Sixteenth-century Bungay had two parishes (St Mary and
                            Trinity), each with its own parish church, both of which answered to the
                            feoffees of the town trust. The two parishes appear to have been the
                            principal producers of religious performance in the town, independent of
                            each other. The principal patron of the curacy of St Mary church was the
                            duke of Norfolk. The principal patrons of Holy Trinity vicarage were the
                            bishop and abbey of Barlings (until 1538), the Crown (until 1631), and
                            the bishop of Ely (in 1638) (Birch, <title>Ancient Sites</title>, pp
                            60–3; Goult, <title>East Suffolk</title>, n.p.)</ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> Both this case and STAC 2/26/456 stem from a violent
                            encounter between two groups of men in Bungay at 11 pm on 16 June 1515,
                            the Friday following Corpus Christi Day. Five plaintiffs led by John
                            Richers (also known as Riches) are accusing Richard Wharton, bailiff of
                            Bungay and future comptroller for the duke of Norfolk, together with
                            John Wodcok, Thomas Wodcok and diverse others, with destroying in a riot
                            five pageants owned by the inhabitants of the town. The incident occurs
                            well before the onset of the Reformation and gives no indication that it
                            involved trouble between sectarian groups. Indeed, in his counter suit,
                            Wharton willingly agrees to replace the pageants with new ones. Rather
                            the destruction (which happened well into the night) appears to have
                            occurred during a brawl whose reasons are obscure. Wharton had the
                            authority of the bailiffship and of the duke of Norfolk behind him. The
                            five plaintiffs might have represented five local guilds, each
                            responsible for a pageant, but the Guild of Corpus Christi is the only
                            guild (craft or religious) which is known to have existed. Thus the
                            conflict might well reflect struggle between competing power centers
                            (burgesses versus manorial control), a competition which had been
                            endemic in Suffolk for centuries. </ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> The case provides important clarifying information
                            concerning the nature of Corpus Christi celebrations in Bungay.
                            Churchwardens' accounts confirm that, through 1547–8, Bungay had a
                            'game' on Corpus Christi Day, built a stage (confirming that the game
                            was a <rs ref="eats:40453" type="Drama_Type">play</rs>), and recorded
                            payments for ringing the bells and washing 6 albs. They make no
                            reference to pageants, but this case confirms that Bungay also brought
                            forth 5 pageants on Corpus Christi Day that treated of Old and New
                            Testament topics mirrored in certain of the morality plays associated
                            with East Anglia. </ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> The Bungay bill of complaint (or bill of riot) is the
                            only document in STAC 2/7 that is related to this case; the only given
                            date of the document is a reference to the incident as occurring on 16
                            June 1514. Given the outrage of those who owned the destroyed pageants,
                            it seems likely that their filing of the bill of complaint would have
                            come swiftly, most likely well within a year of the incident. Thus the
                            probable date assigned the document here.</ab>

                            Suffolk, to Thomas Cromwell (1485–1540), chancellor of the Exchequer,
                            1533–40, and lord privy seal, 1536–40, concerning potentially seditious
                            plays and players in Suffolk. Henry VIII's break with Rome, executed
                            under the leadership of Thomas Cromwell, had created an explosive
                            political and religious atmosphere in Suffolk during the 1530's. As the
                            King's most senior representative in Suffolk itself, Charles Brandon
                            bore responsibility for detecting and suppressing protest, conspiracy,
                            and insurrection agains the royal agenda, whatever form it took. The
                            dangers to the Crown were real. The Lincolnshire Rising had broken out
                            in Louth a year earlier, on 1 October 1536. It was followed by the
                            Pilgrimage of Grace later in October 1536, which was a huge conservative
                            insurrection by some 40,000 people in Yorkshire and other places in the
                            Northeast part of the kingdom. Suffolk itelf had been a center of
                            proto-Protestant unrest since the fourteenth century, and in this part
                            of the sixteenth century the countryside and towns of Suffolk were
                            filled with whisperings, fiery rhetoric, sermonizing, and polemical
                            drama. </ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> Brandon affirmed to Cromwell that Mr Wharton, comptroller
                            of the duke of Norfolk and bailiff of Bungay had reported that on May
                            Day 1536, a play (also called a May game) had been performed. However,
                            as written by Brandon, the report does not say that the play was
                            performed in Bungay. While Bungay churchwardens' accounts include
                            copious evidence that plays (also called games) were performed together
                            with church ales in Bungay, none of those performances or ales occurred
                            on May Day as part of May games.</ab>

                            in the River Waveney that makes the town nearly an island. At the
                            Conquest, William awarded the lordship of the manor of Bungay Burgh to
                            Roger Bigod (earl of Norfolk), which lordship passed through his
                            descendants to the Howards (dukes of Norfolk), where it remains today.
                            Historically, the reeve (known as the Prime Feoffee) led a group of
                            twenty-four elected feoffees (also known as trustees) who governed the
                            town. The reeve (representing the duke) and feoffees alone conducted
                            local governance in Bungay until 1910, when the Urban District Council
                            was formed. Its ten members and the twenty-four feoffees now jointly
                            govern the town (see Birch, <title>Ancient Sites</title>, pp 60–2, and
                            Goult, <title>East Suffolk</title>, np). </ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> As local lords, the dukes of Norfolk were always a
                            dominating presence, claiming income from the mint, the fishery, the
                            bridge, and use of the River Waveney between Beccles and Bungay. The
                            records do not confirm the presence of tensions between the lord and the
                            townsmen concerning control of the town, but a strong element of
                            Wycliffite sympathy reemerged in the town in the late fifteenth century,
                            as did drama of protest in the early sixteenth </ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> Norman Bungay began life as two parishes (St Mary and
                            Trinity), each with its own parish church of the same name. Both
                            parishes left fine sets of churchwardens' accounts described below. The
                            church of Bungay St Mary was originally the church of Bungay Priory, a
                            nunnery founded in 1160. Both parishes answered to the feoffees of the
                            town trust, and the two appear to have been the principal producers of
                            religious performance in the town, independent of each other. The
                            principal patron of the curacy of St Mary church was the duke of
                            Norfolk. The principal patrons of Holy Trinity vicarage were the bishop
                            and abbey of Barlings (until 1538), the Crown (until 1631), and the
                            bishop of Ely (in 1638). </ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> Both this case and STAC 2/7 (see <ref
                                target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid73/">Bickers et al v.
                                Richard Wharton, Bailiff of Bungay, 1514-15</ref>) stem from a
                            violent encounter between two groups of men in Bungay at 11 pm on 16
                            June 1515, the Friday following Corpus Christi Day. Five plaintiffs led
                            by John Richers (also known as Riches) have, in STAC 2/7, accused
                            Richard Wharton, bailiff of Bungay and future comptroller for the duke
                            of Norfolk, together with John Wodcok, Thomas Wodcok and diverse others,
                            with destroying in a riot five pageants owned by the inhabitants of the
                            town. The incident occurred well before the onset of the Reformation and
                            gives no indication that it involved trouble between sectarian groups.
                            Indeed, in this, his counter suit, Wharton willingly agrees to replace
                            the pageants with new ones. Rather, the destruction (which happened well
                            into the night) appears to have occurred during a brawl whose reasons
                            are obscure. Wharton had the authority of the bailiffship and of the
                            duke of Norfolk, who was lord of Bungay, behind him. The five plaintiffs
                            might have represented five local guilds, each responsible for a
                            pageant, but the Guild of Corpus Christi is the only guild (craft or
                            religious) which is known to have existed. Thus the conflict might well
                            reflect struggle between competing power centers (burgesses versus
                            manorial control), a competition which had been endemic in Suffolk for
                            centuries. </ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> The two cases provide important clarifying information
                            concerning the nature of Corpus Christi celebrations in Bungay.
                            Churchwardens' accounts confirm that, through 1547–8, Bungay had a
                            'game' on Corpus Christi Day, built a stage (confirming that the game
                            was a play), and recorded payments for ringing the bells and washing six
                            abbes. The churchwardens' accounts make no reference to pageants, but
                            this case confirms that Bungay also brought forth five pageants on
                            Corpus Christi Day that treated of Old and New Testament topics mirrored
                            in certain of the morality plays associated with East Anglia.</ab>

                            Holy Cross. As indicated by a charter granted by Henry III in 1235, the
                            priory was always wealthy in endowments of land, properties and churches
                            in both Norfolk and Suffolk, and in 1535 its total income was listed as

                            it appears never to have fully recovered from the Black Death because in

                            is never recorded as having received a negative visitation. The precise
                            date of its dissolution is unclear, but the duke of Norfolk, having
                            taken possession by 1536, found no nuns there. The former priory was

                                Priory</rs> was founded <hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1160 by Roger de
                            Glanville and his wife, the Countess Gundreda. It was meant for
                            Benedictine nuns, and was dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary and the
                            Holy Cross. As indicated by a charter granted by Henry III in 1235, the
                            priory was always wealthy in endowments of land, properties and churches
                            in both Norfolk and Suffolk, and in 1535 its total income was listed as
                            £61 11s 9 1/4d. In 1287 the house had a prioress and fifteen nuns, but
                            it appears never to have fully recovered from the Black Death because in
                            1493 it had a prioress but only nine sisters. In its entire history, it
                            is never recorded as having received a negative visitation. The precise
                            date of its dissolution is unclear, but the duke of Norfolk, having
                            taken possession by 1536, found no nuns there. The former priory was
                            formally granted to the duke on 18 December 1537 (<title>VCH:

                            received on 3 August 1550, directed that it should educate boys and
                            youths of Bury; that it should have sixteen governors who lived or
                            lodged in the town; that it should be a free school, save for a charge
                            of 4d for admission; and that it should have a headmaster and an usher.
                            The school was initially located on a site near Eastgate Street, on
                            former lands of the guild of St Thomas á Becket. The school building
                            itself was called the Guildhall (not the town guildhall, but the former

                            representatives of the guild of Woolen and Linen Weavers addressing
                            concerns over the misdeeds of some weavers, licensed and unlicensed, in
                            the town. The actions of those wayward few and the lack of effective
                            rules has, according to the regulations, caused great distress and decay
                            in town and countryside. The agreement arises from the guild's petition
                            to the abbot, as lord of the town, requesting that he agree to the new
                            regulations. The channelling of a portion of funds from all sources into
                            the Ascension pageant suggests that the pageant was an object of some
                            size and complexity that required a considerable underwriting and

                            received on 3 August 1550, directed that it should educate boys and
                            youths of Bury; that it should have sixteen governors who lived or

                            of 4d for admission; and that it should have a headmaster and an usher.
                            The school was initially located on a site near Eastgate Street, on
                            former lands of the guild of St Thomas á Becket. The school building
                            itself was called the Guildhall (not the town guildhall, but the former

                        <ab type="edDesc">The village of Creeting St Mary, in Bosmere and Claydon
                            Hundred, lies in the centre of the county, two miles northeast of
                            Needham Market on what was originally a Roman road from Colchester, to
                            Norwich, to Caistor St Edmund. The population of the village was
                            eighteen in 1086, forty-two taxpayers in 1327, forty-one taxpayers in
                            1525, and sixty adults in 1603. Though never large, the village appears
                            to have been prosperous, influential, and historically complex in the
                            way that it evolved. Creeting began as a single village in 1215. By the
                            fourteenth century it had become Greater and Lesser Creeting, then later
                            became one of the three adjoining parishes of Creeting St Mary, All
                            Saints, and St Olave. When St Olave ceased to exist as a viable parish,
                            St Mary and All Saints became known as Creeting-two-Churches. In the
                            nineteenth century the three parishes were merged into one, as Creeting
                            St Mary. Anciently Creeting also had two alien priories dating from
                            Norman times: the Priory of St Mary (<hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1156), a
                            cell of the abbey of St Mary of Bernay in Normandy; and the church and
                            priory of St Olave (<hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1070), which eventually
                            came into the possession of Edmund de la Pole. It also had several small
                            manors. On the history of Creeting, see Goult, <title>East
                                Suffolk</title>, np; Birch, <title>Ancient Sites</title>, pp 95–6;
                            and Wasson, <title>Plays and Players</title>, p 149). </ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> The most important parish institution in Creeting appears
                            to have been the <rs ref="eats:375295" type="Collective_GuildsReligious"
                                >guild of Jesus and Corpus Christi</rs> (typically referred to in
                            the records as the Jesus Guild), whose membership, as John Wasson notes,
                            came from as far away as Mendlesham (<title>Plays and Players</title>, p
                            149). The heading on f 3 of the guild book says that the guild was
                            founded in 1468. As was typical of religious guilds in Suffolk, its
                            members included men and women in a shared equity, as did its
                            governance. In 1487, for example, the heading is followed by a typical
                            order that one Thomas Dey and his wife, Isabel, should be 'holders' of
                            the account for the following year. It said the same in subsequent
                            years. Many of the accounts do not give the accounting year, but those
                            that do so indicate that accounts were reckoned within a few days of the
                            Feast of Corpus Christi. In 1486–7, for example, the account was
                            declared on 18 June. </ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> It is uncertain how these accounts made their way from
                            Creeting to the PRO, but it perhaps occurred in the aftermath of the
                            dissolution of the religious guilds as part of a royal commission.</ab>

                        <ab type="edDesc">Bungay lies four miles west of Beccles at a looping bend
                            in the River Waveney that makes the town nearly an island. At the
                            Conquest, William awarded the lordship of the manor of Bungay Burgh to
                            Roger Bigod (earl of Norfolk), which lordship passed through his
                            descendants to the Howards (dukes of Norfolk), where it remains today.
                            Historically, the reeve (known as the Prime Feoffee) led a group of
                            twenty-four elected feoffees (also known as trustees) who governed the
                            town. The reeve (representing the duke) and feoffees alone conducted
                            local governance in Bungay until 1910, when the Urban District Council
                            was formed. Its ten members and the twenty-four feoffees now jointly
                            govern the town (see Birch, <title>Ancient Sites</title>, pp 60–2, and
                            Goult, <title>East Suffolk</title>, np).</ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> As local lords, the dukes of Norfolk were always a
                            dominating presence, claiming income from the mint, the fishery, the
                            bridge, and use of the River Waveney between Beccles and Bungay. The
                            records do not confirm the presence of tensions between the lord and the
                            townspeople concerning control of the town, but a strong element of
                            Wycliffite sympathy reemerged in the town in the late fifteenth century,
                            as did drama of protest in the early sixteenth century. No records would
                            suggest that the Trinity parish game had content expressing
                            protest.</ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> Sixteenth-century Bungay had two parishes (St Mary and
                            Trinity), each with its own parish church, both of which answered to the
                            feoffees of the town trust. The two parishes appear to have been the
                            principal producers of religious performance in the town, independent of
                            each other. The principal patron of the curacy of St Mary church was the
                            duke of Norfolk. The principal patrons of <rs ref="eats:373062"

                            attribution, that Bungay had a guild of Corpus Christi; and a group of
                            wives collectively helped produce the Corpus Christi celebrations in a
                            manner reminiscent of a religious guild (<title>East Suffolk</title>,
                            np). In any event, the dominant forces in the town in terms of lay piety

                        <ab type="edDesc">Bardwell (of Blackbourn Hundred in West Suffolk) is
                            situated two and a half miles north of Ixworth and ten miles southeast
                            of Thetford. Of Anglo-Saxon origins, it had grown during the medieval
                            period into a large and wealthy village with town-like features. By 1283
                            Bardwell was already a large parish with 128 taxpayers, and appears to
                            have been wealthy in crops and livestock (Dymond and Northeast,
                                <title>History of Suffolk</title>, p 44; see also Warren, 'Guild of
                            St Peter,' pp 81–110. </ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> Bardwell had forty-seven taxpayers in 1327 and 209 adults
                            in 1603. Though essentially a farming community, its inhabitants
                            included skilled craftsmen as well as yeomen and husbandmen, and it had
                            a guildhall. Its most important institution appears to have been the
                            guild of St Peter, established in 1474. Bardwell's principal landholder
                            was the abbey of Bury St Edmunds, though its benefice was controlled by
                            the prior of Ixworth. Its church is dedicated to St Peter and Paul
                            (Goult, <title>West Suffolk</title>, np; Birch, <title>Ancient
                                Sites</title>, pp 26–7). Most significantly in its performance
                            history, Bardwell had a parish play (called a game) which cried its
                            banns at Thetford in 1505–6. Bardwell's guild of St Peter included three
                            minstrels among its members. The guild accounts include transactions
                            involving church ales, a large procession, a banner cloth of St Peter,
                            rush bearing, and dinners. Bardwell also had a camping close. </ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> The accounts mention St Thomas drinkings in 1518–20 (pp
                            141, 157) with customary amounts given, and town drinkings in 1544–5
                            that continue through the sixteenth century and beyond (SRO Bury: FL
                            222/11/22, pp 16–17, 19, 22, and ff), the carrying of rushes to the
                            townhouse in 1600, and dinners with cheese, beer, and other supplies. In
                            1625–6 the account was made on St Mark's Day (25 April), but between
                            1551–79 accounts were made on All Souls' Day (2 November) (pp 83-9). By
                            that date Bardwell parish had four town wardens and two church reeves or
                            wardens. </ab>

                            increasingly 'dominated by shearmen and weavers' in particular. By 1522,
                            according to Dymond and Northeast, Boxford had the largest number of
                            cloth workers in Babergh Hundred (<title>History of Suffolk</title>, pp
                            52, 550; Bailey, <title>Medieval Suffolk</title>, pp 22-4; . Of 101
                            taxpayers in 1522, fifty-five worked in the cloth trades. Boxford's
                            population was recorded as being eighteen in 1086, twenty-five taxpayers
                            in 1327. In 1522 a muster roll indicated that Boxford had sixty
                            clothworkers. Boxford's <rs ref="eats:371536" type="Place_F_Church"
                                >church</rs> was dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary and the parish
                            had a parson. Pre-Reformation Boxford had three religious guilds (St
                            Peter, Holy Trinity, and St John), but as was typical of many
                            cloth-making towns, it developed, in Blackwood's words, 'protestant
                            tendencies' and became a centre of puritanism, although it was able
                            quickly to restore Catholic furnishings and worship during the brief
                            reign of Mary (Goult, <title>West Suffolk</title>, np; Dymond and
                            Northeast, <title>History of Suffolk</title>, p 52; Blackwood,
                                <title>Tudor and Stuart Suffolk</title>, pp 91, 94-5, 99. It had a
                            grammar school by 1596 with two free scholars each from Boxford,
                            Edwardstone, Groton, and Assington, plus an additional twelve paying
                            scholars (Birch, <title>Ancient Sites</title>, p 45; Goult, <title>West
                                Suffolk</title>, np). </ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> Pre-Reformation Boxford traditionally raised the majority
                            of funds for the parish by three means each year: four to six ales most
                            seemingly sponsored by the local religious guilds and one by the
                            churchwardens; by a gathering and supper on Plough Monday; and by
                            contributions to a hockpot. By far the greatest amounts came from the
                            hockpot (usually more than 40 shillings). The hockpot appears annually
                            through 1546–7 among amounts received. It is usually positioned near the
                            Plough Monday receipts, but is always distinct from them, and the
                            hockpot amounts always far exceed those from ales or Plough Monday
                            gatherings. It seems likely that the hockpot refers to the kind of
                            gathering activity traditionally held at Hocktide (on the Monday and/or
                            Tuesday after Easter, thus between 31 March and 4 May). It might be a
                            one or a two-day event. If the latter, men imprisoned (or bound) women
                            on Monday (or confiscated their shoes) until the women paid release
                            money. Women similarly captured the men on Tuesdays. The money raised by
                            the women always far exceeded that raised by the men. Ales averaged
                            between 5 and 10 shillings; the Plough Monday gathering about 10 s. The
                            play in 1535 seems to have been intended to be a one-time fundraiser to
                            bring in a large amount of money, which it did. The accounts give no
                            clues as to the entertainments that might have accompanied the various
                            gatherings. The pre- Reformation dinners and religious processions with
                            banners seem to have been replaced in the seventeenth century by civic
                            processions and dinners held during Rogation Days, as was typical in
                            other Suffolk towns. </ab>

                        <ab type="edDesc">Long Melford, a small but significant market town in
                            Babergh Hundred, lies along the principal Sudbury-to-Bury road three
                            miles from Sudbury and fourteen miles from Bury. Paradoxically, being an
                            important manor of the abbey of Bury St Edmunds furthered both Long
                            Melford's industrial development and its pre-Reformation parish culture.
                            As Mark Bailey has observed, like other successful textile towns in
                            Suffolk, Long Melford flourished 'on the large manor of a major
                            landlord' (increasing the tax base fattened the coffers of the landlord,
                            and Long Melford ranked sixth in Suffolk in taxable wealth in 1524-5).
                            The abbot's manor was an '800-acre demesne together with 600 acres of
                            villein land' (Bailey, <title>Medieval Suffolk</title>, pp 300, 33,
                            282). The abbot was granted a weekly market and fair in 1235, and the
                            town had a nine-day annual fair from 1330. In population, it grew from
                            sixty-three in 1086, to sixty-two taxpayers in 1327, 1,000 persons in
                            1524, and 1,150 persons in 1603. It had a school by 1350, in which the
                            chantry priest served as schoolmaster. In the 1460's Long Melford ranked
                            fifth among Suffolk towns as a centre of cloth manufacturing and by the
                            1520's had more fullers than any other Suffolk town (Dymond and
                            Northeast, <title>History of Suffolk</title>, pp 52–3; Bailey,
                                <title>Medieval Suffolk</title>, pp 249, 272–4; Goult, <title>West
                                Suffolk</title>, np; Blackwood, <title>Tudor and Stuart
                                Suffolk</title>, p 5).</ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> Long Melford's early parish identity was just as
                            substantial as was its industrial self. Its grand fifteenth century
                            parish church of the Holy Trinity has been variously described as one of
                            the 'the finest parish churches in England,' and 'a village cathedral.'
                            The 'enormous' glebe of the parish covered 251 acres of arable, meadow,
                            pasture, and wood lands (Dymond and Northeast, <title>History of
                                Suffolk</title>, p 55; Blackwood, <title>Tudor and Stuart
                                Suffolk</title>, pp 62, 63-4; <title>Medieval Suffolk</title>, p
                            15). The Long Melford churchwardens' accounts mention six religious
                            guilds, including Corpus Christi, St Thomas, Blessed Virgin Mary, St
                            Peter, Jesus, and Bachelors, four of which left streamers or banner
                            cloths in an inventory of 1541. It may have included a young persons'
                            guild as well, based on payments in the accounts. A guildhall of Corpus
                            Christi stood at what Goult says was Little St Mary's in Hall
                            Street.</ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> As the accounts show, pre-Reformation Long Melford raised
                            money by means of ales, games, and other gatherings, many sponsored by
                            the guilds. By 1584 the parish was raising money for the poor and the
                            king mainly by rents and rates (rather than by traditional customs and
                            ales), though many pre-Reformation customs survived throughout much of
                            the sixteenth century and certainly through the 1560s and 1570s. The
                            records mention sepulchre watchings in 1556–7/8 (ff 38, 39, 46v); silk
                            cloth and cloth belonging to the sepulchre (ff 5, 60); a watching at
                            Christmas in 1556 (f 38v); and banner cloths and poles in 1557; silk
                            streamers and banner cloths for the several guilds in 1558–9 (ff 39,
                            57), and the plough light (ff 46v, 52), and processioners, all in 1558–9
                            (f 56v). Clearly the parish sought to preserve many of its pious and
                            festive traditional customs even after the abolition of the guilds.</ab>

                            to approximately 100 adults. Wattisfield is strategically located on the
                            main road from Bury to the Norwich Road, and is within two miles of
                            Walsham le Willows, which had a game place used specifically for the

                            play, lies about ten miles from Wattisfield on the main road between
                            Bury and the Norwich Road. Stanton appears to have been more substantial
                            than Wattisfield: its population in 1603 was 329 adults; it was built
                            near what had been a major Roman villa; it had three religious guilds St
                            John (1475), All Saints (1472), and Jesus (nd); it was a site of
                            pilgrimage to the shrine of St Petronille; and it had at least three
                            greens or commons. Stanton was originally two parishes, All Saints and
                            St John Baptist, each with its own church. Today All Saints alone
                            survives as a parish and a church (Birch, <title>Ancient Sites</title>,
                            pp 350–1; Goult, <title>West Suffolk</title>, np). It borders Walsham le
                            Willows and its game place that was used for play production.</ab>

                            bordered by what remains of a Roman Road. It had but one manor, and in
                            the parish church of the Blessed Virgin Mary two chantries: Our Lady's,
                            established in 1306, and St Margaret's, in 1437. The main structure of
                            the church dates from the fifteenth century. The village had three
                            ancient greens, one of them Maypole Green located west of the church
                            (Birch, <title> Ancient Sites</title>, pp 104–5). Early Dennington was
                            never a large place. Its population has been estimated as thirty-four in
                            1096, twenty-eight taxpayers in 1327), fifty-five taxpayers in 1524, and
                            220 adults in 1603), including yeomen, husbandmen, tailors, and (between
                            1600 and 1649) a cooper, thatcher, and tanner. But it was far from
                            isolated, having roads connecting it to numerous parishes, including
                            many (as for example, Saxstead, Stradbroke, and Framlingham) that
                            generated their own performance records (Goult, <title>East

                            Stowmarket on the River Gipping, whose waters eventually connect it to
                            the North Sea. It was once a small town which had a market from 1238,
                            and a free school founded in 1491. Its population, which numbered
                            forty-six in 1086, and sixty-seven taxpayers in 1327, grew from
                            fifty-two taxpayers in 1524 to 160 adults in 1603. The town had a guild
                            of the Holy Trinity by 1458. Mendlesham suffered greatly for its
                            protestantism during the reign of Mary Tudor, with several of its
                            residents burned at the stake as martyrs for their faith. Mendlesham had
                            one manor and four sub-manors, and today has several surviving medieval
                            and Tudor manor houses. Mendlesham's <rs ref="eats:451049"

                        <ab type="edDesc">Stradbroke is a substantial village seven miles from Eye,
                            Suffolk, and nine miles from Diss, Norfolk, which lies midway between in
                            Norwich and Ipswich. Stradbroke appears always to have served as a
                            source of marketing and services for nearby villages. It was granted
                            markets in 1225 and 1227 and a fair in 1309. It is claimed that Bishop
                            Robert Grosseteste was born there in 1168 in the early Town House, a
                            'timber-framed building which stood on the T-Junction, just south-west
                            of the church' (Birch, <title>Ancient Sites</title>, p 362). By 1463 the
                            Town House was called St Anne's Guildhall after Stradbrokes's guild of
                            St Anne. In 1587 a benefactor endowed a free school held in the chamber
                            of the guildhall. Stradbroke's population was sixty-two residents in
                            1086, seventy-seven taxpayers in 1327, sixty-four taxpayers in 1524, and
                            360 adults in 1603. The manor of Stradbroke was linked successively to
                            Sir John Wingfield, William de la Pole, Thomas, Lord Howard, Charles
                            Brandon, and Henry, Prince of Wales, who owned it in 1610. In short,
                            Stradbroke was a locally important settlement (Birch, <title>Ancient
                                Sites</title>, pp 361–2; Goult, <title>East Suffolk</title>,

                            churchyard located 'along the High Street' (Pevsner,
                                <title>Buildings</title>, p 446). The main structure of the church
                            dates from the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries; its tower dates from
                            the fifteenth century. The parish was a vicarage (Pevsner,

                        <ab type="edDesc"> Why one or more itinerant professional troupes visited
                            Stradbroke in successive years is unclear. Stradbroke is on the road
                            from Framlingham (an important venue) to Wingfield, Eye, or Diss, but no
                            performance records in those places for the same years survive. By the
                            1630s, the only troupes routinely travelling in Suffolk were those with
                            royal patrons. The visitors to Stradbroke certainly had an important
                            patron because the town paid them well to depart, rather than summarily
                            sending them on their way. Records often indicate that similar incidents
                            happened because towns were suffering dearth, were afflicted with
                            sickness, or had religious (reformist) objections to performance
                            itself.</ab>

                            originally a hamlet of Mendham and part of five Mendham manors. Its
                            roads readily connect it to Mendham, Fressingfield, and South Elmham. It
                            had no population in 1086, sixty- eight taxpayers in 1327, thirty-eight
                            taxpayers in 1524, and 176 adults in 1603, most of whom were yeomen,
                            husbandmen, and weavers. Its soil is seasonally waterlogged and
                            permeable, which may explain why it had the extraordinary number of ten
                            moats. Yet in spite of its unpromising profile, Metfield appears to have
                            had a strong sense of its community self. It had a guildhall as of 1556,
                            a grammar school before 1590, and a guild of St John Baptist with
                            aldermen. Lacking an important patron, its <rs ref="eats:451083"

                                in his later years, he was also a mercenary. He wrote pageants for
                                Queen Elizabeth I's progresses to Bristol and Norwich, at which he
                                was present. The extracts below concerning the queen's stays in

                                account from Churchyard's <title>A discovrse</title>.<lb/> Sir
                                William Spring (d. 1599), of Packenham, Suffolk, who oversaw the
                                queen's stay in Suffolk, was high sheriff of Suffolk in 1578–9; he
                                was knighted by the queen upon taking that position. He was the son
                                of Sir John Spring of Lavenham, whose family was associated with
                                puritanism, and Anne Kitson, daughter of Sir Thomas Kitson, of
                                Hengrave Hall near Bury St Edmunds. Sir William Cordell (by
                                1524–81), of Long Melford, Suffolk, who provided the first great
                                feast for Elizabeth I in Suffolk, was speaker of the House of
                                Commons during her reign. He had been granted the manor of Long
                                Melford by Queen Mary, and was married to Mary Clopton (d. 1584),
                                daughter of Richard Clopton of Ford Hall, Long Melford. Sir William
                                Drury (8 March 1550–90), of Hawstead, near Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk,
                                provided the second great feast for Elizabeth I in Suffolk, this one
                                at his residence at Hawstead. Drury was an MP, a JP from <hi
                                    rend="italic">c</hi> 1577, and high sheriff for Suffolk in 1582.
                                While serving with English forces in the Low Countries, he was
                                wounded in a dispute with Sir John Borough and eventually died of
                                infections caused by the wound. He married Elizabeth Stafford,
                                daughter of Sir William Stafford of Staffordshire. Their son, Sir
                                Robert Drury (1575–1615) was patron to the poet John Donne. Sir
                                Robert Jermyn (1539–1614), of Rushbrooke, Suffolk, who twice feasted
                                the French ambassadors, was knighted by Elizabeth I in 1578. He was
                                appointed high sheriff of Suffolk for 1579. Jermyn was an extreme
                                puritan not inclined toward the arts of political or civil
                                compromise. Sir Thomas Kitson (1540–1602), of Hengrave Hall, near
                                Bury St Edmunds, entertained Elizabeth I for three nights during her
                                progress. His father, Sir Thomas Kitson (1485–1540), sheriff of
                                London in 1533 and a member of the Merchant Adventurers' company,
                                had built Hengrave Hall and purchased many properties, including
                                eight ecclesiastical manors in Suffolk. (Blackwood, <title>Tudor and
                                    Stuart Suffolk</title>, p 86). Sir Arthur Higham, of Barrow
                                Hall, Suffolk (six miles from Bury St Edmunds), similarly feasted
                                the Queen. Higham was the son of John Higham, high sheriff of
                                Suffolk in 1577 and an unyielding puritan. Sir Thomas Revett (d.
                                1583) of Chippenham, Cambridgeshire (four miles from Newmarket,
                                Suffolk) was knighted by the queen during her progress. Revett was
                                the son of Thomas Revett of Stowmarket, Suffolk.</p></note>

                            was born in Hull, Yorkshire East Riding, and was buried at Wingfield,
                            Suffolk. He was the son of Michael de la Pole, first earl of Suffolk and
                            Katherine de Wingfield, and was the husband of Katherine de Stafford,
                            countess of Suffolk. He accompanied Henry V to France, and died of
                            dysentery during the seige of Harfleur. </ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> Wingfield, located seven miles east of Eye, was the
                            ancient home of the Wingfield family. When Michael de la Pole, became
                            the husband of the heiress Katherine Wingfield, and new owner of the
                            estate, he built Wingfield Castle, which became the seat of the De la
                            Poles thereafter (Birch, <title>Ancient Sites</title>, 420). Today it is
                            a private family residence. Somewhat anachronistically, which was
                            typical of housebuilding in the period, the building is ‘between a
                            defensive castle and a fortified manor house although its outward
                            appearance is very much the image of how a castle should appear’ (Birch,
                                <title>Ancient Sites</title> 420). Its 'splendid outer front with
                            central three-storeyed gatehouse' survives, as does much of the house,
                            which was built <hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1540, supplanting an old manor

                            great-great-grandson of Edward I. The elder Mowbray was also second earl
                            of Nottingham and earl marshal of England. Suspected of complicity in
                            the killing of the duke of Gloucester, he was banished in 1398 to
                            Venice, where he died. His son, the Mowbray of these accounts, did not

                            of Nottingham, eighth Baron Segrave, and seventh Baron Mowbray. He was
                            raised in the household of Isabella, Richard II's second queen. In the

                        <ab type="edDesc">The borough of Eye, Suffolk, is situated five miles
                            southeast of Diss, Norfolk, and its marsh waters were navigable to the
                            River Waveney, which forms the border between the two counties.
                            Anciently, Eye was an honour that included 220 estates and a market in
                            Eye town, all controlled by William Malet until the banishment of his
                            son by Henry I, when the Crown took control of the town. Eye received
                            its borough charter from King John in 1205 (a date now disputed by
                            some), and was governed by a mayor, four aldermen, twelve common
                            councillors and twenty-five burgesses. It sent representatives to
                            parliament from 1570. Archaeological evidence confirms the site's
                            continuous habitation from Roman times to the present. Historic remains
                            at Eye include those of its Norman castle and the Benedictine priory of
                            St Peter and the Apostles.</ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> Eye recorded 147 residents in 1086, eighty-three
                            taxpayers in 1327, 102 taxpayers in 1524, and 410 adults in 1603. It had
                            a free grammar school before 1548, a guildhall of St Mary described by
                            Birch as 'a fine timber-framed building delightfully situated beside the
                            beautiful church,' and two religious guilds (Our Lady and St Peter). A
                            portion of its parish church of Saints Peter and Paul dates from
                            Domesday, with structural elements constructed in the thirteenth,
                            fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries (Birch, <title>Ancient
                            Sites</title>, pp 124–6; and Goult, <title>East Suffolk</title>,

                        <ab type="edDesc"> The early records of Eye have not been preserved and the
                            only substantial records to survive are chamberlains' accounts
                            intermittently covering forty-five years between 1409 and 1591.
                            Unfortunately those accounts are fragmentary at best, loose sheets
                            archived as separately lettered items, many of which are receipts or
                            expenses to do with Eye's marshy area.</ab>

                            from the late eleventh century. When monks from the monastery of St
                            Andrew, Rochester, received the church of St Felix at Walton from Roger
                            Bigod between 1087 and 1100, they established a cell at Walton that
                            included the churches of Walton and Felixstowe. The total receipts of
                            the Felixstowe priory's account roll for 1499 were £33 9s 10 1/2d, but
                            by the time of the dissolution, the priory was in a sorry state. The
                            priory was dissolved in 1528, during which process the archdeacon of
                            Worcester, Stephen Gardiner, on behalf of Cardinal Wolsey's commission,
                            seized the monastery, awarding it and all its goods and buildings to the
                            new college of Cardinal Wolsey being established at Ipswich, and
                            ordering the prior and monks to join other Benedictine monasteries. The
                            duke of Norfolk then formally granted the now impoverished Felixstowe to
                            Wolsey. However, when Wolsey's college failed, the Crown conveyed the
                            priory and its appurtenances to the duke of Norfolk (<title>VCH:

                            accessed 15 December 2023). The priory lay between the present church of

                            cell at Walton. The account most likely made its way to The National

                        <ab type="edDesc">This case began in 1594 as a dispute between the
                            plaintiff, Robert Corbold, yeoman, of Careleton Colvell and fifteen
                            named defendants over profit-making use of a twenty-four acre parcel of
                            land (a demesne). In his bill of complaint, Corbold claims that on 27
                            March 1594 he entered into a lease with William Hullock, yeoman, of
                            Gisleham, permitting him (Corbold) to farm the land and give half the
                            income to Hullock, by which Corbold had ploughed and sowed the fields.
                            But as he was harvesting the crops on 3-4 December 1594, the Hullock
                            family and at least twenty others, armed with hooks, rakes, pitchforks,
                            swords, daggers and oher weapons invaded the property, assaulted
                            Corbold, cut the traces connecting Corbold's horse and cart, ejected
                            Corbold from the site, and carried away the harvested crops. Then, from
                            10 October forward, at least five of the defendants wrote, sold, sang,
                            and taught to their children a slanderous rimed libel, which suvives
                            only in this bill.) </ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> This bill is a stand-alone document, but it generated
                            both a number of other documents responding to it, and related cases in
                            Star Chamber. In an undated document in 1595, defendants Hullock
                            Everard, William Hullock and his wife Prudence Hullock answered the
                            bill, denying the charges therein that they had written, published, or
                            disseminated the ballad. Corbold's bill, they claimed, was merely meant
                            to vex and molest them and to cause them to accrue needless legal
                            expenses. Further, they said, the charges were vague and uncertain in
                            the law (TNA: STAC 5/C70/5, item no [2], single sheet). On 10 February
                            1595/6 the defendants filed an answer and demurrer rejecting the
                            plaintiff's charges against them and asking the court to dismiss their
                            charges and expenses (TNA: STAC 5/C1/21, item no 2). In a replication
                            dated 22 May 1596, the plaintiff Corbold rejected the defendants'
                            protestations point by point and reaffirmed his wish to make his case in
                            court against the defendants for their 'most grevious and daungerous

                        </msIdentifier>
                        <ab type="edDesc">In this bill of complaint, Paul Powle (d. <hi
                                rend="italic">c</hi> 1650), attorney and self-described gentleman of
                            Great Waldingfield (three miles northeast of Sudbury) accused his former
                            apprentice in law, Robert Rogers of Horringer (formerly Horningsheath,
                            two miles west-southwest of Bury) of libel against him and his wife by
                            writing, publishing and performing a libellous song (reprinted in the
                            complaint) and other materials that targeted the Powles. The apprenticed
                            youth, Robert Rogers, is the son of Thomas Rogers, clerk parson of
                            Horringer. While the case springs initially from the unhappy conflict
                            between Powle and his apprentice, in time it embroiled a great swath of
                            the legal establishment and the local gentry in this part of Suffolk.
                            Although Powle descended from a prominent fifteenth-century family in
                            Bury St Edmunds, he is represented in the historical record by his
                            reputation for being notoriously quarrelsome, litigious, and
                            unforgiving. The legal community in Suffolk, both civil and
                            ecclesiastical, appears to have agreed with that assessment. During the
                            rule of Archbishop Laud, in a case before an ecclesiasical court of high
                            commission, Powle was found guilty, excommunicated, fined, deprived of
                            his lands, and imprisoned. In the Star Chamber matter, only Powle's bill
                            of complaint survives, giving no indication that the case went further
                            than the bill. For a useful history of the Powle family, see Havelock

                        <ab type="edDesc">The town of Hadleigh in Cosford Hundred lies equidistant
                            between Long Melford, Ipswich, and Nayland, and about five miles from
                            Boxford, in south-west Suffolk. As a peculiar of the archbishop of
                            Canterbury, it was one of only four Suffolk parishes to exist outside
                            the jurisdiction of the bishop of Norwich. It had one archiepiscopal
                            manor, four sub-manors and three chapels. At the same time Hadleigh had
                            a keen sense of its own corporate identity and suceeded in becoming a
                            chartered borough in 1618, with a mayor, seven aldermen, and sixteen
                            burgesses, and quickly set up a full panoply of civic structures and
                            services ruled by an oligarchy of prominent citizens. But in 1685/6, in
                            the confused aftermath and governmental misadventures that followed the
                            Restoration, Hadleigh permanently lost its charter (Joanna Martin,
                            'Ecclesiastical Jurisdictions,' <title>Historical Atlas</title> Dymond

                        <ab type="edDesc"> From the fourteenth through the mid-seventeenth
                            centuries, Hadleigh was 'an important centre for the manufacture of
                            woolen cloth,' with a population ranging, between the 1560's and 1640s,
                            from 2,500 to more than 3,000 people. The town suffered through
                            particularly intense religious conflicts during through the sixteenth
                            century. As Hadleigh historian Sue Andrews puts it, Hadleigh combined
                            'deep Catholic piety' with 'a tendency towards independence of mind and
                            an interest in dissident ideas' that mixed in volatile ways with the
                            economic anxieties of local cloth workers and the new ideas of the
                            Protestant revolution. From the 1520's forward Hadleigh became 'a
                            notorious haunt of evangelicals,' leading eventually to the burning
                            and/or imprisonment of three Protestant martyrs from Hadleigh. With the
                            reign of Elizabeth I overt religious protest faded away, while the town,
                            perhaps because of its relatively protected status, managed to continue
                            in many of its traditional customs through the end of the sixteenth
                            century (Andrews and Springall, <title>Hadleigh</title>, pp 40–2,143,

                            mounted a play in the parish church. Hadleigh had an ancient tradition
                            of local players but except for the probable reference in 1597 (see <ref

                            Hadleigh's players occur in payments for performances that they had
                            given elsewhere. These include the payments cited above by the Howards
                            at Stoke-by-Nayland at Christmas in 1481, and on St Stevens Day 1526–7
                            at night (both times paying 6s 8d); and by the city's chamberlain at
                            Canterbury on 10 September 1538 (see James M. Gibson (ed), <title>Kent:
                                Diocese of Canterbury</title>, REED vol 1 (London and Toronto,

                        <ab type="edDesc"> Hadleigh had long been a peculiar of the priory of
                            Canterbury Cathedral and the archbishop of Canterbury. The manor of
                            Hadleigh provided three weeks' provisions to the monks of Canterbury and
                            other agricultural goods throughout the year. That important manorial,
                            financial, and ecclesiastical relationship likely accounts for the
                            presence of Hadleigh's players at Canterbury in 1537 – a place at which
                            they could assume that they would be welcomed and rewarded (Jones,

                        <ab type="edDesc">The town of Hadleigh is situated in Cosford Hundred,
                            equidistant between Long Melford, Ipswich, and Nayland, and about three
                            miles from Boxford, in southwest Suffolk. As a peculiar of the
                            archbishop of Canterbury, it was one of only four Suffolk parishes to
                            exist outside the jurisdiction of the bishop of Norwich. In spite of
                            that dominating archiepiscopal presence, Hadleigh had a keen sense of
                            its own corporate identity. From the fourteenth through the mid-
                            seventeenth centuries Hadleigh was 'an important centre for the
                            manufacture of woolen cloth,' in later decades outstripping Sudbury,
                            Nayland and other towns in this major cloth-working region. Between the
                            1560's and 1640s, driven by industry, its population grew from 2,500 to
                            more than 3,000 people. In 1618 it suceeded in becoming a chartered
                            borough, with a mayor, eight aldermen, and sixteen burgesses, and
                            quickly set up a full panoply of civic structures and services ruled by
                            an oligarchy of prominent citizens. But sixty-six years later, in the
                            confused aftermath and governmental misadventures that followed the
                            Restoration, Hadleigh permanently lost its charter (Joanna Martin,

                            religious conflicts during through the sixteenth century were intense.
                            Hadleigh combined 'deep Catholic piety' with 'a tendency towards
                            independence of mind and an interest in dissident ideas' that mixed in
                            volatile ways with the economic anxieties of local cloth workers and the
                            new ideas of the Protestant revolution. From the 1520's forward Hadleigh
                            became 'a notorius haunt of evangelists,' leading eventually to the

                            play survived in an unbroken tradition during the entire second half of
                            the sixteenth century is unclear. An entry in the town's Market
                            Feoffment Book in 1600 confirms that the town also permitted the staging
                            of plays in the guildhall. Hadleigh also had a boy bishop ceremony, as
                            indicated by entries in 1480 and 1546. Finally, Hadleigh school boys
                            performed plays written by their talented schoolmaster for several
                            audiences on multiple occasions. Hadleigh also had a camping close for
                            sports and other diversions. </ab>

                        <ab type="edDesc">The town of Hadleigh is situated in Cosford Hundred,
                            equidistant between Long Melford, Ipswich, and Nayland, and about three
                            miles from Boxford, in southwest Suffolk. As a peculiar of the
                            archbishop of Canterbury, it was one of only four Suffolk parishes to
                            exist outside the jurisdiction of the bishop of Norwich. In spite of
                            that dominating archiepiscopal presence, Hadleigh had a keen sense of
                            its own corporate identity. From the fourteenth through the mid-
                            seventeenth centuries Hadleigh was 'an important centre for the
                            manufacture of woolen cloth,' in later decades outstripping Sudbury,
                            Nayland and other towns in this major cloth-working region. Between the
                            1560's and 1640s, driven by industry, its population grew from 2,500 to
                            more than 3,000 people. In 1618 it suceeded in becoming a chartered
                            borough, with a mayor, eight aldermen, and sixteen burgesses, and
                            quickly set up a full panoply of civic structures and services ruled by
                            an oligarchy of prominent citizens. But sixty-six years later, in the
                            confused aftermath and governmental misadventures that followed the
                            Restoration, Hadleigh permanently lost its charter (Joanna Martin,
                            'Ecclesiastical Jurisdictions,' <title>Historical Atlas</title> Dymond
                            and Martin (eds) (Ipswich, 1989), pp 24–5; Birch, <title>Ancient
                                Sites</title>, pp 124–6; and Goult, <title>East Suffolk</title>, np;

                            240–55).<lb/><lb/> Within its complex social environment, Hadleigh's
                            religious conflicts during through the sixteenth century were intense.
                            Hadleigh combined 'deep Catholic piety' with 'a tendency towards
                            independence of mind and an interest in dissident ideas' that mixed in
                            volatile ways with the economic anxieties of local cloth workers and the
                            new ideas of the Protestant revolution. From the 1520's forward Hadleigh
                            became 'a notorius haunt of evangelists,' leading eventually to the
                            burning and/or imprisonment of several Protestant martyrs from Hadleigh.
                            With the reign of Elizabeth I overt religious protest faded away, while
                            the town, perhaps because of its relatively protected status, managed to
                            continue in many of its traditional customs through the end of the
                            sixteenth century (Andrews and Springall, <title>Hadleigh and the

                        <note type="edDesc"><p>Beriah Botfield (1807-63) was president of the
                                British Archaeological Association, a Fellow of the Royal Society
                                and a distinguished bibliographer and botanist. Botfield and Thomas
                                Hudson Turner edited (and Botfield presented) their variously
                                credited <title>Manners and Household Expenses</title> for the
                                Roxburghe Club. Botfield edited many other primary materials as
                                well. Of present relevance is Section Three of <title>Manners and
                                    Household Expenses</title>, entitled 'Accounts and Memoranda of
                                Sir John Howard, first Duke of Norfolk, A.D. 1462, to A.D. 1471.' To
                                assemble his transcription of that material, he used two manuscripts
                                of Howard's personal accounts. The first of the two now survives as
                                BL: Add. MS 46349 (see <ref
                                    target="https://ereed.org/search/?facet_people_named_h=163205"
                                    >Sir John Howard's Household Accounts</ref>). Its contents
                                extend from November 1462 through July 1469. When Botfield saw it,
                                this first manuscript was 'in the valuable collection of Sir Thomas
                                Phillipps, Bart., at Middle Hill, who purchased it at the sale of
                                the library of the late Mr. Craven Ord' (<title>Manners and
                                    Household Expenses</title>, p xciv). However, the second of the
                                two manuscripts (which runs 1463–71) has disappeared. The manuscript
                                was then in 'the property of his Grace the Duke of Norfolk.' It had
                                formerly been in the possession of Peter le Neve, Norroy King at
                                Arms, who wrote in the flyleaf that it had been 'brought from
                                Framlingham Castle in Suff., given to me by Mr. Thomas Martin,
                                attorney at law, of Palgrave in Suff., 1727' (<title>Manners and
                                    Household Expenses</title>, p xciv). This second manuscript is
                                not now within the duke of Norfolk's archives at Arundel Castle, nor
                                at the British Library or other major repositories; thus Botfield's
                                transcription is the only available source for its contents. The two
                                manuscripts (based on Botfield's transcription of the second) each
                                contain a number of payments not found in the other. <lb/><lb/> The

                                Nayland, a village in Babergh Hundred in southwest Suffolk has been
                                described as 'big and beautiful.' Its many charming features include
                                a sixteenth-century guildhall lying beside the spectacular
                                perpendicular parish church of St Mary, and a number of other fine
                                buildings. The site of the village shows evidences of very early
                                occupation, including a long tumulous (an ancient communal burial
                                site). The population of the village in 1086 was fifty-seven
                                persons, growing to forty taxpayers in 1327, 118 in 1524, and 900 in
                                1603 - the extraordinary surge in 1603 caused by the growth of the
                                cloth industry. The village had one manor and nine sub-manors, an
                                ancient priory now lost, two chapels, a green, two hamlets, and a
                                market and fair (awarded to William Tendring in 1303), and two
                                others (awarded to Sir John Howard in 1478 and 1482) (Arthur Mee,

                                appears to have been a complex social environment. In the fifteenth
                                century it was home to Sir John Howard, sheriff of Suffolk and
                                Norfolk, later duke of Norfolk and earl marshal of England, who
                                lived at Tendring Hall. At the same time, the community of Stoke had
                                a robust life of its own. It had three religious guilds (dedicated
                                to the Blessed Virgin Mary, St Thomas, and the Holy Trinity), thus
                                the need for its guildhall. It became one of the important
                                manufacturers of broadcloth in the county; the wealth of its
                                merchants financed its grand parish church during the fifteenth
                                century. Scholars have argued that Stoke may have had Lollard roots.
                                It certainly had intense protestant convictions during the sixteenth
                                century. Gordon Blackwood has shown that Stoke had more protestant
                                names in its fines register than did 'any other clothing centre in
                                the deaneries of Clare, Sudbury, and Samford.' It had no 'prominent
                                Catholic gentry family,' and was strongly anti-Marian (four of its
                                residents were burned at the stake in Bury St Edmunds). Rioters
                                attacked the house of the Catholic Sir Francis Mannock (Gordon

                        <ab type="edDesc">Sir John Howard (<hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1422–85) was the
                            son of Sir Robert Howard, of Tendring, Essex, and Lady Margaret Mowbray,
                            daughter of Thomas, duke of Norfolk. As chamberlain to the duke of
                            Norfolk, his father-in-law, Howard administered the duke's estates in
                            East Anglia and in 1455 was elected to parliament, representing Norfolk
                            for the Yorkists. He enjoyed the great favor of Edward IV and was named
                            Lord Howard in the late 1460s, but the king eventually seized Howard's
                            rights as heir to the Mowbray estates and to creation as duke of
                            Norfolk, granting them instead to the king's son, the duke of York. Upon
                            the death of Edward IV, Howard cast his lot with Edward's brother,
                            Richard, duke of Gloucester, who granted Howard his title as duke of
                            Norfolk. In 1485 Howard died supporting Richard III at the Battle of
                            Bosworth Field. He was interred at Thetford Monastery in Norfolk (John

                        <ab type="edDesc"> Stoke by Nayland, a village in Babergh Hundred in
                            southwest Suffolk has been described as 'big and beautiful.' Its many
                            charming features include a sixteenth-century guildhall lying beside the
                            spectacular perpendicular parish church of St Mary, and a number of
                            other fine buildings. The site of the village shows evidences of very
                            early occupation, including a long tumulous (an ancient communal burial
                            site). The population of the village in 1086 was fifty-seven persons,
                            growing to forty taxpayers in 1327, 118 in 1524, and 900 in 1603 - the
                            extraordinary surge in 1603 caused by the growth of the cloth industry.
                            The village had one manor and nine sub-manors, an ancient priory now
                            lost, two chapels, several greens, two hamlets, and a market and fair
                            (awarded to William Tendring in 1303), and two others (awarded to Sir
                            John Howard in 1478 and 1482) (Arthur Mee, <title>The King's England:

                        <ab type="edDesc"> Stoke by Nayland appears to have been a complex social
                            environment. In the fifteenth century it was home to Sir John Howard,
                            sheriff of Suffolk and Norfolk, later duke of Norfolk and earl marshal
                            of England, who lived at Tendring Hall. At the same time, the community
                            of Stoke had a robust life of its own. It had three religious guilds
                            (dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary, St Thomas, and the Holy Trinity),
                            thus the need for its guildhall. It became one of the important
                            manufacturers of broadcloth in the county; the wealth of its merchants
                            financed its grand parish church during the fifteenth century. Scholars
                            have argued that Stoke may have had Lollard roots. It certainly had
                            intense protestant convictions during the sixteenth century. Gordon
                            Blackwood has shown that Stoke had more protestant names in its fines
                            register than did 'any other clothing centre in the deaneries of Clare,
                            Sudbury, and Samford.' It had no 'prominent Catholic gentry family,' and
                            was strongly anti-Marian (four of its residents were burned at the stake
                            in Bury St Edmunds). Rioters attacked the house of the Catholic Sir
                            Francis Mannock (Gordon Blackwood, <title>Tudor and Stuart

                        <ab type="edDesc">The greater part of this manuscript book (ff 1–109)
                            contains the household accounts of Sir John Howard between 2 May 1482
                            and 20 October 1483, plus the names of a thousand men (ff 110-116v)
                            granted by Howard to Richard III on 26 February 1484. Thereafter follow
                            (ff 117–126) a commission of array from Henry VII to the earl of Oxford,
                            and (ff 126v–138) a set of household accounts from 10 January 1490
                            through January 1491 whose ownership remains a matter of dispute. In his
                            nineteenth-century edition of the two accounts, Collier identifies this
                            second set as belonging to Thomas Howard, earl of Surrey, son of Sir
                            John Howard. The Society of Antiquaries, in its published catalogue of
                            2000, seemingly following Collier, identifies the accounts for 1490-91
                            as being those of Thomas Howard, earl of Surrey. However, Melvin Tucker,
                            in a 1960 article, most emphatically claims that these are the accounts
                            not of Surrey but of John de Vere, thirteenth earl of Oxford ('Household
                            Accounts 1490-1491 of John de Vere, Earl of Oxford,' <title>English
                                Historical Review</title> 75.296 (July 1960), 468–74). Tucker points
                            out that Collier offers no supporting evidence that the accounts are
                            Surrey's, then cites considerable internal evidence from the accounts
                            pointing to de Vere as the author of the accounts (for Collier's claims,
                            see <title>Household Books</title>, p xviii). Based on the persuasive
                            nature of Tucker's argument, this collection treats this second set of
                            accounts as de Vere's. They are transcribed in Alan Nelson (ed),

                            and was the brother-in-law of Henry VII. He served as lord admiral from
                            May 1513, and on 9 September of that same year made major contributions
                            to the defeat of the Scots at the Battle of Flodden Field, in
                            Northumberland. In 1536 he suppressed the Pilgrimage of Grace in
                            northern England. Howard lost two nieces to the brutal and ruthless
                            justice of Henry VIII. Anne Boleyn was executed in 1536, followed by
                            Catherine Howard, Henry's fifth wife, in 1542. Howard's opposition to
                            Thomas Cromwell, Thomas Cranmer, and other religious reformers, together
                            with suspicions surrounding him concerning his own son, Henry Howard,
                            earl of Surrey, led to Henry's order that Howard be executed. When Henry
                            died before the order could be carried out, Howard remained in prison
                            until restored as duke of Norfolk by Queen Mary.</ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> Howard's primary residence during this year was Tendring
                            Hall, Stoke-by-Nayland, but he sometimes stayed at Framlingham Castle.
                            These accounts record expenses and receipts during one of those stays.
                            As this account book shows, the castle was a venue for visiting troupes,
                            both professional and local. The very impressive castle, surviving today
                            in the village of Framlingham, dates from the twelfth century. In the
                            fourteenth century it passed to Thomas Brotherton, the first of the
                            earls of Norfolk, then descended through marriage to the Mowbrays,
                            thence to the Howards in 1483. That illustrious family held the castle
                            and estate until 1635, when Theophilus Howard under the extreme pressure
                            of debt, sold it to Sir Robert Hitcham, an alumnus of Pembroke College,
                            Cambridge University. For philanthropic reasons, he willed the castle
                            and estate (with its early records) to Pembroke College and it came into
                            the hands of the college a year later, in 1636, when Hitcham died. In
                            the early twentieth century the college transferred it to state
                            guardianship and today it is managed by The National Heritage.</ab>

                                Howard</rs> (<hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1422–85) was the son of Sir
                            Robert Howard, of Tendring, Essex, and Lady Margaret Mowbray, daughter
                            of Thomas, duke of Norfolk. As chamberlain to the duke of Norfolk, his
                            father-in-law, he administered the duke's estates in East Anglia and in
                            1455 was elected to parliament representing Norfolk for the Yorkists. He
                            enjoyed the great favor of Edward IV and was named Lord Howard in the
                            late 1460's, but the king eventually seized Howard's rights as heir to
                            the Mowbray estates and to creation as duke of Norfolk, granting them
                            instead to the king's son, the duke of York. Upon the death of Edward
                            IV, Howard cast his lot with Edward's brother, Richard, duke of
                            Gloucester, who granted Howard his title as duke of Norfolk. In 1485
                            Howard died supporting Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth Field. He
                            was interred at Thetford Monastery in Norfolk (John Martin Robinson,
                                <title>The Dukes of Norfolk</title> (Oxford, 1995), 4–9).</ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> Stoke by Nayland appears to have been a complex social
                            environment. In the fifteenth century it was home to Sir John Howard,
                            sheriff of Suffolk and Norfolk, later duke of Norfolk and earl marshal
                            of England, who lived at Tendring Hall. At the same time, the community
                            of Stoke had a robust life of its own. It had three religious guilds
                            (dedicated to St Mary, St Thomas, and the Holy Trinity), thus the need
                            for its guildhall. It became one of the important manufacturers of
                            broadcloth in the county; the wealth of its merchants financed its grand
                            parish church during the fifteenth century. Scholars have argued that
                            Stoke may have had Lollard roots. It certainly had intense protestant
                            convictions during the sixteenth century. Gordon Blackwood has shown
                            that Stoke had more protestant names in its fines register than did 'any
                            other clothing centre in the deaneries of Clare, Sudbury, and Samford.'
                            It had no 'prominent Catholic gentry family,' and was strongly
                            anti-Marian (four of its residents were burned at the stake in Bury St
                            Edmunds). Rioters attacked the house of the Catholic Sir Francis Mannock

                        <ab type="edDesc">The idiosyncratic system of courts in Ipswich unusually
                            conducted the early town's governance (both judicial and
                            administrative). That system evolved away from its original form over
                            time, as did the system for keeping those courts' records. The earliest
                            iteration of record keeping, which ended in the early fifteenth century,
                            was a series of court rolls kept separately for each of the town's three
                            courts: initially the Portmanmote/Great Court, the Petty Court, and the
                            Petty Court of Recognizances. The Portmanmote/Great Court treated of
                            admissions, pleas related to tenants, recoveries of properties, and
                            other major actions (Allen, <title>Ipswich Borough Archives</title>, pp
                            41–3). The Petty Court, or Court of Petty Pleas, which attended to
                            fines, bonds for good behavior, and other business of the town, 'touched
                            almost every aspect of life in the town and became 'the borough's
                            principal judicial organ' (Geoffrey Martin, 'The Borough and the
                            Merchant Community of Ipswich, 1317-1422,' D. Phil. thesis, Oxford
                            University, 1955, cited in Allen, <title>Ipswich Borough
                                Archives</title>, p 58). The Petty Court of Recognizances was
                            essentially 'a register of titles to property within the liberties of
                            the borough' (Allen, <title>Ipswich Borough Archives</title>, p 73). </ab>

                        <ab type="edDesc">The Court of High Commission was the 'supreme
                            ecclesiastical court in England from the inception of the Act of
                            Supremacy of Henry VIII in 1534 to 1689, when the court was abolished'

                            became puritanism and the identification, suppression and punishment of
                            puritan clergy, as is the matter of this document, which is directed at
                            a reformist clergyman, Samuel Ward, in Ipswich.</ab>

                                ref="eats:402653" type="Collective_Office">bailiffs</rs>' and
                            chamberlains' small warrants for various activities. The actions that
                            they dictate would characteristically show up later as payments in the
                            accounts of the chamberlains or treasurers. It seems reasonable to think
                            that the warrants were made by bailiffs during the business meetings of
                            the Assembly, requiring, as some of them do, the signatures of senior
                            burgesses. </ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> The overriding administrative responsibility of
                            governance in Ipswich was to collect, manage and disburse the town's
                            money. Working on behalf of the Assembly and the Great Court, the town's
                            financial officials, in order of seniority, were the two bailiffs, the
                            treasurer, and the two chamberlains, all selected from the ranks of the
                            burgesses and all elected annually on 8 September, their terms to run
                            Michaelmas to Michaelmas.</ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> The history of administrative governance in Ipswich is
                            chiefly the story of institutions created (mainly via their use of royal
                            charters) to limit the powers and ensure the honesty of earlier
                            institutions, to increase local control of money, and to respond to the
                            increasing complexity of town finances. The bailiffs, for example, began
                            very early as the heads of administrative responsibility to the Crown
                            for the farm of the town. Eventually the bailiffs evolved into the
                            town's chief financial officers (and <hi rend="italic">ex officio</hi>
                            justices of the peace) who, at least nominally, oversaw the treasurer
                            and chamberlains. However, the treasurer and chamberlains themselves had
                            been created to exert indirect control over the bailiffs' sometimes
                            questionable activities. The treasurer, drawn from the most senior
                            burgesses (a group known as 'the 24' who constituted the governing
                            administrative body of the town) 'tended to deal with the more
                            prestigious figures' of the town (high steward, recorder, preacher,
                            members of parliament), and sometimes went on to be bailiff. The
                            chamberlains, who were drawn from the ranks of the inferior burgesses,
                            dealt with the less prestigious burgesses (bailiffs, legal advisors, and
                            so on), although in reality they became very important financial
                            officials. In actual practice, the duties of treasurers and chamberlains
                            overlapped, as their financial accounts show. For detailed analyses of

                                keeper Sir Nicholas Bacon. His father, Edmward Bacon, was third son
                                of the lord keeper and his first wife, Jane Ferneley of West
                                Creeting, and half-brother to Francis Bacon, Viscount St Albans, who
                                served as MP for Ipswich for a time. Nathaniell was born at
                                Coddingham, Suffolk in 1593, studied at Grays Inn and was called to
                                the bar in 1617. He was well respected both as a scholar and a
                                public servant, had strong parliamentarian sympathies and
                                represented Cambridge University as an MP. <lb/><lb/> In 1642 the
                                borough of Ipswich elected him town recorder, simultaneously making
                                him a free burgess of the town. In addition to his duties as
                                recorder, Bacon represented the town's causes in London and in the
                                town's courts. He also served as town clerk and clerk of the peace,
                                and as a claviger with custody of the common seal and records of the
                                corporation (thus his interest in and access to the civic records
                                that he extracted and summarized in his historic book). He held
                                those offices until his death in 1660 (burial in London). It is
                                clear that the town valued him immensely, paying his annual fee of
                                £20, and his travel costs including his horse and lodgings. He lived
                                in a mansion house in the parish of St Margaret in Ipswich and was
                                likely churchwarden of that parish for a time in that he signed for
                                the churchwardens' accounts in 1650 and 1651.<lb/>
                                <lb/> In Bacon's research into the town's records, his goal, as
                                stated in the Preface to the <title>Annalls</title> was to recollect
                                the scattered writings and records of the town that lay in disarray
                                like rubbish. His reason for so doing was to teach the current
                                residents who had become ignorant of their own town's laws and
                                history. In recognizing that prodigious work, the town granted his
                                widow an annuity of £25 for Bacon's 'great paynes <gap
                                    reason="omitted"/> in the transcribinge of several ancient
                                Records belonging to this Towne.' He was described as a 'pious,
                                prudent and learned man.' Bacon's will was made on 26 August 1660
                                and proved in PCC on 8 July 1661. Much of the detail in this
                                biographical note is gleaned from the introduction by Sterling
                                Westhorpe, mayor of Ipswich, to W.H. Richardson's memoir; see
                                    <title>Annalls</title>, pp i–v.<lb/>
                                <lb/> The editor, W. H. Richardson is described on the title page of
                                his edition as being of St Mary Hall, Oxford; a fellow of the
                                Society of Antiquaries; and former assistant master in both Christ
                                Church Cathedral School, Oxford, and Queen Elizabeth's School, Ipswich.<lb/>
                                <lb/> The originals of the greater number of the records summarized
                                by Bacon survive, but the few entries here printed do not turn up in
                                the original documents where their neighbouring entries can be
                                found. Bacon's <title>Annalls</title> provides the only surviving
                                reference to them and they must, therefore, be treated as
                                antiquarian material. The original court books in which they might

                        <ab type="edDesc">In the early fifteenth century the Portmanmote, the
                            principal court of Ipswich, formally split into two entities, giving us
                            the essential features of the post- medieval court system in Ipswich.
                            While the Portmanmote preserved its real actions (mainly to do with land
                            and properties), an entity called the Great Court (or General Court)
                            emerged. It was a purely administrative court, and it became the supreme
                            authority in non-judicial matters in Ipswich. The court turned over much
                            of its power to the Assembly, a body composed of the <rs
                                ref="eats:402653" type="Collective_Office">bailiffs</rs>, the twelve
                                <rs ref="eats:423221" type="Collective_Office">portmen</rs>, and the
                            twenty-four members of the Common Council, acting on recommendations
                            made by the Assembly. The Assembly Books, which record the proceedings
                            of that body, survive in five in-period volumes (C/4/3/1–4) covering the
                            years December 1563 through January 1644. Contents of the books include
                            corporate leasings; appointments of officers, including officials of
                            Ipswich schools and charities; repairs of town properties; and meetings
                            of the twenty-four members of the Common Council to replenish their own
                            ranks (Allen, <title>Ipswich Borough Archives</title>, p 423). </ab>

                                researches into Suffolk, and Ipswich in particular, survive in
                                collections at the British Library, the Bodleian, and the Suffolk
                                Archives. He was also a respected watercolour artist and member of
                                the artistic community in East Anglia.<lb/>
                                <lb/> The detailed description on p 174 of the moving of the date of

                                merely repeats a summary of one of the lines quoted by Wodderspoon:
                                'Occupacons in this towne shall be drawn into companies' (307). The
                                original court order which Wodderspoon appears to have seen is not
                                to be found in Composite Court Book, Suffolk Archives C2/10/3/15
                                (for the years 1575–80), the only surviving original source in which
                                it would be expected to appear.<lb/>
                                <lb/> Similarly, the appointment of John Crossley (Cressey <hi

                                November 1598, appears only in Wodderspoon (p 183). An original
                                court order made on 16 November is not to be found in either the
                                Great Court Book, Suffolk Archives C/2/2/2/1 (1571–1836), or in

                            record, in rough form, the proceedings of the Assembly. Most governance
                            in shires and corporate towns during the medieval and early modern
                            periods was, as David Allen puts it, 'curial in nature' (<title>Ipswich
                                Borough Archives</title>, p 413). In fifteenth-century Ipswich, the
                            town's earliest judicial institution, its Portmanmote/Great Court, split
                            into two entities: a Portmanmote, which conducted judicial actions for
                            the town, and a General or Great Court, which was 'the supreme authority
                            in non-judicial matters' (<title>Ipswich Borough Archives</title>, pp
                            42, 423) The General Court was composed of all the town's free
                            burgesses, who in their meetings issued ordinances that governed the
                            town. The Assembly included the <rs ref="eats:402653"
                                type="Collective_Office">bailiff</rs> (presiding), the twelve <rs
                                ref="eats:423221" type="Collective_Office">Portmen</rs> and the
                            twenty-four common councilmen, all of whom served 'as a check on the
                            General or Great Court.' Allen variously describes the Assembly's
                            official remit as being to deliberate, to advise, and to recommend,
                            whereas in fact it exercised wide powers in protecting the town, serving
                            as a panel to choose (from its own ranks) the future members of the
                            Great Court, and to audit borough finances. It also bore responsibility
                            for the administering of the Grammar School, corporation scholars, and
                            the awarding of Cambridge University exhibitions by Martin's Charity, a
                            local foundation. The volatile combination of religious and political
                            forces present in the town during this era may partially explain the
                            sudden rise of the Assembly, reflecting the need to control (see Allen,
                                <title>Ipswich Borough Archives</title>, pp 41–3, 413, 423). </ab>

                        <ab type="edDesc">In the early fifteenth century, the Portmanmote, the
                            principal court of Ipswich, formally split into two entities, giving us
                            the essential features of the post-medieval court system in Ipswich.
                            While the Portmanmote preserved its real actions (mainly to do with land
                            and properties), an entity called the Great Court (or General Court)
                            emerged. It was a purely administrative court, and it became the supreme
                            authority in non-judicial matters in Ipswich. The General Court turned
                            over much of its power to the Assembly, a body composed of the <rs
                                ref="eats:402653" type="Collective_Office">bailiffs</rs>, the twelve
                                <rs ref="eats:423221" type="Collective_Office">portmen</rs>, and the
                            twenty-four members of the Common Council, acting on recommendations
                            made by the Assembly. The Assembly Books, which record the proceedings
                            of that body, survive in four volumes (C/4/3/1-4) covering the years
                            December 1563 through January 1644 (Allen, <title>Ipswich Borough
                                Archives</title>, p 423). </ab>

                            there emerged a 'series of Composite Enrollments and Composite Court

                            whereas in fact it exercised wide powers in protecting the town, serving

                            customs, laws and ordinances in customals, the first two of them in the
                            form of rolls, all later ones in codices. The first of them, written in
                            response to the town's first charter from King John, was stolen by the
                            town's felonious common clerk on 19 September 1272. Senior men in the
                            town made from memory a second version of that customal in 1291. It too
                            was lost but several judiciously made copies survived. It is from those
                            copies, containing the text of the customs as we have them, that the six
                            surviving medieval customals of Ipswich derive, three of them at the
                            British Library, the other three at Suffolk Archives, Ipswich. See
                            Allen, <title>Ipswich Borough Archives</title> pp 413-21, who

                        <ab type="edDesc"> The earliest of the six survivors (BL: Add. MS 25,012)
                            dates from <hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1309. It is a plain working copy.
                            Next, the 'Little Domesday' or 'Black Domesday' (Suffolk Archives,
                            Ipswich: C/4/1/1), dating from <hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1320, is roughly
                            contemporary to BL: Add. MS 25,012 and appears intended to be a formal
                            version of it. It is from the 'Black Domesday' that the four subsequent
                            medieval customals derive. </ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> Our document, the 'Little Domesday' or 'White Domesday'
                            (Suffolk Archives, Ipswich: C/4/1/2) is so named because it has a white
                            leather and board cover with leather straps and metal clasps. It was
                            finished in 1338, the year in which Edward III granted to the town a
                            charter of confirmation. 'White Domesday' contains the two earliest
                            orders of the Ipwich Corpus Christi procession, one from the fifteenth
                            century in Latin and English, the other from the early sixteenth century
                            in English. 'White Domesday' is slightly earlier than BL: Add. MS 2,788.
                            Both were transcribed by the same scribe. </ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> The fifth of the customals, chronologically speaking, is
                                <title>Customale Gippovicense</title> (Suffolk Archives, Ipswich:
                            C/4/1/3). Datable to 1378, it is slightly later in origin than either
                            the 'White Domesday' or Egerton MS 2,788, and has the most elaborate
                            rubrication and ornamentation of any of the customals. It contains a
                            combination of Latin and English translations. This customal disappeared
                            from the civic archive before 1646, and travelled through several
                            centuries of owners, but returned to Ipswich in 1973 when it was
                            purchased for the Suffolk Archives. The remaining medieval customal is
                            BL: Add. MS 25,011. Because it is a fifteenth-century English text of
                            the customs, it was previously disrespected 'as a late version and a
                            translation' of the other customals, but it is now much valued for the
                            attempt it makes to 'rationalize the constitutional evidence' in the
                            customals (Allen, <title>Ipswich Borough Archives</title>, p 414). </ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> The one post-medieval customal, and one of great note, is
                            'The Great Domesday' (Suffolk Archives, Ipswich: C/4/1/4) by Richard
                            Percyvale, dated 1520. Its stated purpose was to acquaint bailiffs and
                            burgesses with the town's grants, liberties, ordinances, laws, and
                            constitutions by translating them out of the French (leaving Latin
                            documents untranslated). However, its unique contributions were that 'it
                            is as much the first history of the town as the last of its Custumals,'
                            and that it preserves ordinances, including Corpus Christi Guild
                            Services and celebrations that would otherwise be lost (Allen,
                                <title>Ipswich Borough Archives</title>, p 41). The other medieval
                            customals are called 'Little' to distinguish them from Percyvale's
                            'Great' Domesday.</ab>

                        <ab type="edDesc">The Great Domesday Book of Ipswich (or 'Percyvales'
                            Domesday') is the first of the town's post-medieval customals,
                            describing itself in its preface as having been compiled on 18 September
                            1520. The volume is divided into seven so- called books, and, in
                            content, 'is as much the first history of the town as the last of its
                            Customals' (Allen, <title>Ipswich Borough Archives</title>, p 414). That
                            is, it includes (on the one hand) charters, ordinances, wills, deeds,
                            precedents and more civic matter dating from 1200BCE through the early
                            1520's. But (on the other hand) it also contains ecclesiastical
                            material, including orders both 'for [the] more efficient performance of
                            religious services' and for carrying out the Corpus Christi procession
                            and celebration, and the social responsibilities of the newly-formed
                            Corpus Christi guild (Allen, <title>Ipswich Borough Archives</title>, p
                            418). Ordinances on ff 85-6, for example, describe the guild's other
                            responsibilities to its members, including the providing of funeral
                            services, the paying of guild priests, and the arranging of guild
                            dinners, and more. Among these directives, the newly written
                            constitution of the guild (ff 119-22) is the matter of relevance to our
                            volume. It is clearly much older than most content in the volume, and
                            was likely copied from Ipswich customals that date from the first half
                            of the fourteenth century. It is written in a careful book hand on
                            vellum in which rules and pricking marks are quite visible. </ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> The dual presence of secular and religious content in the
                            Great Domeday Customal stems from papal actions in the late thirteenth
                            century. Impelled by the newly instituted feast of Corpus Christi
                            (created by Rome in 1264), and the subsequent urgings of local clergy in
                            Ipswich, the town formally changed the name of its merchant guild to the
                            Corpus Christi guild in 1325, ceding ownership of the guild to local
                            clergy but assigning responsibility for the activities of the guild to
                            the guild itself. In so doing, the guild's constitution (written that
                            same year) transformed the former merchant guild into the town's
                            principal socio-religious guild, or confraternity. Its principal
                            responsibilities now included the town's three-day Corpus Christi
                            celebration, including its new Corpus Christi procession, with pageants,
                            plays, ceremonies, and annual dinner, while retaining it ancient civic
                            responsibilities. Multiple entries in the town's records confirm that
                            between 1444 and 1546 the guild flourished as both a confraternity and
                            as a civic history of the town. That combining of religious and civic
                            matter is reflected in the shared content of the Corpus Christi
                            procession and celebration.</ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> The opening section of the constitution (that part not
                            here transcribed) describes in great detail the route and timing of the
                            procession, from its beginning at the church of St Trinity, its progress
                            through the church of St Peter, and its return to the church of St
                            Trinity, a pattern that they reversed in alternate years. Both churches
                            were Austin priories, and spiritual co- sponsors of the new Corpus
                            Christi guild. This section of the Constitution stresses that the dual
                            purpose of the procession was to inspire the faithful and to put
                            confusion into the hearts of the heretics. The section immediately
                            precedes the listing out of the companies of crafts with their pageants,
                            each bearing the name of saint or a biblical incident.</ab>

                        <ab type="edDesc">The Augustinian priory of the Holy Trinity (also known as
                            Christ Church) in Ipswich was founded in 1177. It burned several years
                            later and was rebuilt in 1194. The priory was dissolved along with other
                            lesser monasteries of Suffolk in 1536 and physically suppressed on 9
                            February 1537. Its site and lands were granted to Sir Humphrey Wingfield
                            and Sir Thomas Rushe. Today Christchurch Mansion and Art Gallery stand
                            on the site of the former priory, which is now destroyed. </ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> At the time of its rebuilding in 1194 the priory had a
                            prior and seven canons but over time grew (as its endowments did) to
                            twenty canons. It held a substantial number of religious properties,
                            including six Ipswich churches, five churches elsewhere in Suffolk, and
                            moieties of two others, plus lands in at least eight (likely more) other
                            communities. Its annual income from lands and rents was £47 14s 9d, and
                            £88 14s 4d from its other spiritualities. In visitations through the
                            centuries it encountered few complaints until 1526. In that year's
                            visitation a number of misbehaviours by canons and servants brought

                            conducted the early town's governance (both judicial and
                            administrative). That system evolved away from its original form over
                            time, as did the system for keeping those courts' records. The earliest
                            iteration of record keeping, which ended in the early fifteenth century,
                            was a series of court rolls kept separately for each of the town's three
                            courts: initially the Portmanmote/Great Court, the Petty Court, and the
                            Petty Court of Recognizances. The Portmanmote/Great Court treated of
                            admissions, pleas related to tenants, recoveries of properties, and
                            other major actions (Allen, <title>Ipswich Borough Archives</title>, pp
                            41–3). The Petty Court, or Court of Petty Pleas, which attended to
                            fines, bonds for good behavior, and other business of the town, 'touched
                            almost every aspect of life in the town and became the borough's
                            principal judicial organ' (Geoffrey Martin, ‘The Borough and the

                                Archives</title>, p 58). The Petty Court of Recognizances was
                            essentially 'a register of titles to property within the liberties of
                            the borough' (Allen, <title>Ipswich Borough Archives</title>, p

                            included ordinances, elections (including those of the Guild of Corpus

                            (C/2/10/1-85 in period). Composite Court books recorded the proceedings
                            of the Petty Court ('the principal borough court') and, to a lesser
                            extent, of the other courts in the town. Entries range from pleas of all

                        <ab type="edDesc">The idiosyncratic system of courts in Ipswich unusually
                            conducted the early town's governance (both judicial and
                            administrative). That system evolved away from its original form over
                            time, as did the system for keeping those courts' records. The earliest
                            iteration of record keeping, which ended in the early fifteenth century,
                            was a series of court rolls kept separately for each of the town's three
                            courts: initially the Portmanmote/Great Court, the Petty Court, and the
                            Petty Court of Recognizances. The Portmanmote/Great Court treated of
                            admissions, pleas related to tenants, recoveries of properties, and
                            other major actions (Allen, <title>Ipswich Borough Archives</title>, pp
                            41–3). The Petty Court, or Court of Petty Pleas, which attended to
                            fines, bonds for good behavior, and other business of the town, 'touched
                            almost every aspect of life in the town and became 'the borough's
                            principal judicial organ' (Geoffrey Martin, ‘The Borough and the
                            Merchant Community of Ipswich, 1317-1422,’ D. Phil. thesis, Oxford
                            University, 1955, cited in Allen, <title>Ipswich Borough
                                Archives</title>, p 58). The Petty Court of Recognizances was
                            essentially 'a register of titles to property within the liberties of
                            the borough' (Allen, <title>Ipswich Borough Archives</title>, p 73)</ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> With the collapse of that system of record keeping in the
                            late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries, there followed 'an
                            interval of apparent confusion, and the emergence of the series of
                            Composite Enrolments and Composite Court Books' (Allen, <title>Ipswich
                                Borough Archives</title>, p 157). The Composite Enrollment Rolls
                            entered 'on a single roll the significant business of all the courts,
                            except the Sessions' (Allen, p 158). The organization of this roll – the
                            first of the composite enrollments – is 'haphazard' and unchronological.
                            Its contents encompass recognizances, actions of the clerk, petty pleas,
                            and the business of the General Court.</ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> The General or Great Court formally split from the
                            Portmanmote in the early fifteenth century, becoming thereafter 'a
                            purely administrative body' responsible for the admission of burgesses
                            and the election of officers (including those of the Guild of Corpus
                            Christi), ordinances, admissions, grants, and leases. It was thereafter
                            'the supreme authority in non-judicial matters.' The records of the
                            Great Court include two court rolls, 1470–4 (including this document),
                            and a series of court books running from 1571 through 1836. Only the
                            first of those books (C/2/2/2/1) contains material from our period

                            express 'the sovereign's will on a wide range of matters of public
                            interest <gap reason="omitted"/> issued both to individuals and to
                            corporations.' Patent rolls were registers of those original letters
                            patent. In content, many of the letters included grants related to land,
                            official positions, commissions, pardons, and more. Specifically, the
                            rolls were sheets of parchment onto which were copied the original
                            letters. These sheets for a given year were then stitched together
                            sequentially, and affixed with 'the Great Seal pendent.' During this
                            period, letters and copies were invariably written in Latin. Compiling
                            the rolls was the business of the Chancery; their storage, first in the
                            Rolls Chapel, eventually in the Tower of london, fell under the
                            authority of the Master of the Rolls. See the catalogue description for

                                (Donnington) Kitson Long Bourchier</rs> (1510–61) was countess of
                            Bath from 1548, with residence at Hengrave Hall, Suffolk. Her father was
                            John Donnington (d. 1544), of Stoke Newington in the London borough of
                            Hackney, and a member of the Worshipful Company of Salters. Margaret's
                            mother was Elizabeth Pye (1487–1552) of Derbyshire. The countess married
                            three times, which unions brought her enduring fame for her skill in
                            accruing great wealth and status and for her relentlessness in ensuring
                            the same for her daughters and their daughters. Her first husband was
                            Sir Thomas Kitson (1485–1540), a wealthy merchant and sheriff of London.
                            She was his second wife. Through this marriage she became owner of
                            Hengrave Hall and ensured its succession to her son, Sir Thomas Kitson
                            (1540–1603), and very powerful marriages for two of her daughters.
                            Within months of her husband's death, on 10 November 1541, Margaret
                            married Sir Richard Long (<hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1494–1546), of
                            Wiltshire and Shingay, Cambridgeshire, a courtier who enjoyed the great
                            favor of Henry VIII, became a gentleman of the Privy Chamber, and spent
                            years in the service of the king. The couple had three daughters and one
                            son. Margaret's third husband was John Bourchier (1499–1560/1), third
                            earl of Bath, whom she married in 1548, thereby becoming the countess of
                            Bath. </ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> They made Hengrave Hall their residence. The bizarre
                            circumstances surrounding the couple's wedding illustrates the shrewd
                            and careful nature of the countess on behalf of her family. In the
                            wedding contract, she insisted that at a double wedding at Hengrave Hall
                            on 11 December 1548, she would marry Bourchier and her daughter, Frances
                            Kitson, would marry Bourchier's son, John Bourchier, Lord FitzWarin from
                            the earl's second marriage. That is, the younger Bourchier married his
                            own step-sister, thereby ensuring the Countess's preferred distribution
                            of properties and positions, including her son, Sir Thomas Kitson's,
                            eventual ownership of Hengrave Hall.</ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> Hengrave Hall, the seat of the Kitson family, is a grand
                            Tudor mansion near Bury St Edmunds, built between 1525 and 1538 for Sir
                            Thomas Kitson. Constructed of stone from the Augustinian Priory of
                            Ixworth, plus white brick, it was built around an enclosed courtyard,
                            with a great hall. Most of its structural features and a few of its
                            treasures survive, including a chapel with twenty-one lights of
                            Flemish-style glass depicting salvation history, the dining room, a
                            banquet room with a window bearing the arms of the family of George
                            Washington, first President of the United States, into whose family a
                            sister of the elder Thomas Kitson married. Elizabeth I stayed at the
                            house 27–30 August 1578. Ownership of the house and estate descended
                            from Elizabeth Kitson to her daughter Mary. Eventually to the Kitson
                            estate came into the hands of the Rookwood-Gage baronets and a
                            succession of industrialists and religious owners until 2005. The
                            private current owner is David Harris.</ab>

                            records of the Gage family, now reside at Cambridge University Library.
                            The Kitson collection includes sixteenth and seventeenth century
                            correspondence, household accounts, inventories, and other family
                            papers. The Gage papers also include a huge collection of non-Hengrave
                            materials related to the county of Suffolk. Gathered by Sir Thomas Gage,
                            seventh Baronet, and his brother, the antiquarian John Gage, the
                            collection was held at Hengrave Hall until it was deposited in Cambridge
                            University Library in 1952. With the help of the Heritage Lottery Fund,
                            Cambridge University Library purchased the collection in 2006. </ab>

                            Hengrave Hall, Suffolk, was the wife of Sir Thomas Kitson (1540–1603).
                            He was son and heir of Sir Thomas Kitson (1485–1540), a wealthy
                            merchant, member of the Mercers' Company, sheriff of London, and builder
                            of Hengrave Hall near Bury St Edmunds, which became the seat of the
                            Kitson family. Elizabeth Kitson was the daughter of Sir Thomas
                            Cornwallis (1518/19–1604), of Brome, high sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk
                            for 1552–3, a member of the privy council from 1553, and comptroller of
                            the Household in 1557–8. Her mother was Anne Jerningham (1516–81), of
                            Somerleyton, Suffolk. Elizabeth Kitson was a great patron and lover of
                            music, who retained the composers, musicians, and music teachers Edward
                            Johnson and John Wilbye (some sixty of Wilbye's musical compositions
                            survive) as members of the Kitson household. Hengrave Hall had a music
                            room that contained a huge store of musical instruments and music
                            books.</ab>

                            Thomas Kitson. Constructed of stone from the Augustinian Priory of
                            Ixworth, plus white brick, it was built around an enclosed courtyard,
                            with a great hall. Most of its structural features and a few of its

                            Kitson to her daughter Mary. Eventually the Kitson estate came into the
                            hands of the Rookwood-Gage baronets and to a succession of
                            industrialists and religious owners until 2005. The private current

                        <note type="edDesc"><p>The originals of these inventories are not to be
                                found in the box of Kitson inventories at Cambridge University
                                Library (CUL: Hengrave 87). The only available source continues to
                                be John Gage's <title>The History and Antiquities of Hengrave in
                                    Suffolk</title> (London, 1822), the source used by a number of
                                scholars. According to Gage, his transcription combines inventories
                                made between 29 March and 1 April 1603, and another made on 29 March
                                1603. He provides no information concerning the whereabouts of the
                                originals.<lb/><lb/>As this inventory amply attests, the Kitsons
                                were great patrons of musicians. They employed the composer and
                                musician John Wilbye, author of 'the finest English madrigal
                                collection' at Hengrave for thirty years or more, and he then spent
                                the last ten years of his life at Colchester, in the home of Lady
                                Rivers, Lady Kitson's youngest daughter. In 1600, according to
                                Brown, Wilbye and Edward Johnson worked together effecting the
                                purchase of a famous book of lute-songs (see David Brown and Ian
                                Harwood, 'John Edward (i), '<title>The New Grove Dictionary of Music

                                157)).<lb/><lb/>According to Gage, when Lady Elizabeth Kitson (widow

                                will of Lady Kitson appears to have been lost, and Gage remains the

                        <ab type="edDesc">This undated document is a rough inventory that lists the
                            furniture and furnishings at Hengrave Hall at the time the document was
                            composed, in a typical secretary hand of the period. In two other
                            inventories, from 1603 following the death of Sir Thomas Kitson, the
                            Musicians' Room was filled with musical instruments, music books, and
                            the like and clearly was being used for music. In this inventory,
                            although the room is still called the Musicians' Chamber, it contains
                            only furniture, indicating that it was being used either as a bedroom or
                            a storage room. The only instruments listed were two lutes being kept in
                            an area called the Musicians' Closet. That difference makes it seems
                            likely that this inventory dates well after 1603, retaining only the
                            memory of earlier musicianship in the chamber names. </ab>

                            1509–61) was countess of Bath from 1548, with residence at Hengrave
                            Hall, Suffolk. Her father was John Donnington (d. 1544), of Stoke
                            Newington in the London borough of Hackney, and a member of the
                            Worshipful Company of Salters. Margaret's mother was Elizabeth Pye
                            (1487–1552) of Derbyshire. The countess married three times, which
                            unions brought her enduring fame for her skill in accruing great wealth
                            and status and for her relentlessness in ensuring the same for her

                            second wife. Through this marriage she became owner of Hengrave Hall and
                            ensured its succession to her son, Sir Thomas Kitson (1540–1603), and
                            very powerful marriages for two of her daughters. Within months of her
                            husband's death, on 10 November 1541, Margaret married Sir Richard Long
                                (<hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1494–1546), of Wiltshire and Shingay,
                            Cambridgeshire, a courtier who enjoyed the great favor of Henry VIII,
                            became a gentleman of the Privy Chamber, and spent years in the service
                            of the king. The couple had three daughters and one son. Margaret's
                            third husband was John Bourchier (1499–1560/1), third earl of Bath, whom
                            she married in 1548, thereby becoming the countess of Bath.</ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc">They made Hengrave Hall their residence. The bizarre
                            circumstances surrounding the couple's wedding illustrates the shrewd
                            and careful nature of the countess on behalf of her family. In the
                            wedding contract, she insisted that at a double wedding at Hengrave Hall
                            on 11 December 1548, she would marry Bourchier and her daughter, Frances
                            Kitson, would marry Bourchier's son, John Bourchier, Lord FitzWarin from
                            the earl's second marriage. That is, the younger Bourchier married his
                            own step-sister, thereby ensuring the Countess's preferred distribution
                            of properties and positions, including her son, Sir Thomas Kitson's,
                            eventual ownership of Hengrave Hall.</ab>

                            Thomas Kitson. Constructed of stone from the Augustinian Priory of

                        </msIdentifier>
                        <ab type="edDesc">John Chamberlain (1554–1628) was one of early modern
                            England’s most prolific writers of personal correspondence (479 of his
                            letters survive, mainly to Sir Dudley Carleton and Sir Thomas Winwood).
                            Chamberlain was born in London and, except for occasional trips to
                            Europe and to the English countryside, lived his entire life in London.
                            Chamberlain’s father, Richard, was an alderman, sheriff of London, twice
                            master of the Worshipful Company of Ironmongers, and a member of the
                            Merchant Adventurers. Richard left his son John wealthy, and although
                            John attended Cambridge University at age sixteen, and was admitted to
                            Gray’s Inn in 1575 (but never to the bar), he left no evidence of a life
                            in the professions. He lived in several dwellings near St Paul’s
                            Cathedral during the last thirty years of his life, and spent his days
                            in conversation and conviviality with some of the most influential
                            persons in England. His letters contain many thousands of details
                            concerning life in the London of his time, including individuals,
                            important national events, everyday people, and performances, most
                            notably masques. See Chamberlain, <title>Letters</title>, vol 1, pp 1–7;

                        <ab type="edDesc"> Sir Dudley Carleton (1573/4–1631/2) was born at
                            Brightwell Baldwin, Oxfordshire, and buried at Westminster Abbey. He
                            received a BA in 1595, and an MA in 1600, both from Oxford University;
                            was MP for St Mawes in 1604 and for Hastings in 1626; and was knighted
                            in 1610. Carleton held important diplomatic posts: secretary in France
                            to Sir Thomas Parry, 1602; ambassador to Venice, 1610 (he lived abroad
                            in Venice and The Hague, 1610–25); ambassador to the Netherlands,
                            1616-25; vice-chamberlain of the Household and privy councillor, 1625-8;
                            and secretary of state, 1628. In 1626 he became Baron Carleton of
                            Imbercourt (thus a member of the Peerage), and was created Viscount
                            Dorchester in July 1628. A strong Calvinist, he worked as an anti-papist
                            and religionist on behalf of the king while in Europe. He also became an
                            important collector of Italian art, both for himself and others. Though
                            twenty years apart, he and Chamberlain developed a strong, life-long
                            bond of friendship and trust. He often sought Chamberlain’s counsel.
                            Most of Chamberlain’s letters are addressed to Carleton. See

                            from Bury. One of Crofts’ descendents had it torn down in 1773. Crofts
                            had eleven children and at least fifteen grandchildren. His eight

                            included a rime commenting on a play recently made at Newmarket by
                            members of King's College, Cambridge. Other than the fact that Newmarket
                            was famous for its cock-fighting, nothing else of local entertainments

                        <ab type="edDesc">John Chamberlain (1554–1628) was one of early modern
                            England’s most prolific writers of personal correspondence (479 of his
                            letters survive, mainly to Sir Dudley Carleton and Sir Thomas Winwood).
                            Chamberlain was born in London and, except for occasional trips to
                            Europe and to the English countryside, lived his entire life in London.
                            Chamberlain’s father, Richard, was an alderman, sheriff of London, twice
                            master of the Worshipful Company of Ironmongers, and a member of the
                            Merchant Adventurers. Richard left his son John wealthy, and although
                            John attended Cambridge University at age sixteen, and was admitted to
                            Gray’s Inn in 1575 (but never to the bar), he left no evidence of a life
                            in the professions. He lived in several dwellings near St Paul’s
                            Cathedral during the last thirty years of his life, and spent his days
                            in conversation and conviviality with some of the most influential
                            persons in England. His letters contain many thousands of details
                            concerning life in the London of his time, including individuals,
                            important national events, everyday people, and performances, most
                            notably masques. See Chamberlain, <title>Letters</title>, vol 1, pp 1–7;

                            in the professions. He lived in several dwellings near St Paul’s
                            Cathedral during the last thirty years of his life, and spent his days
                            in conversation and conviviality with some of the most influential
                            persons in England. His letters contain many thousands of details

                        <ab type="edDesc"> Sir Dudley Carleton (1573/4–1631/2) was born at
                            Brightwell Baldwin, Oxfordshire, and buried at Westminster Abbey. He
                            received a BA in 1595, and an MA in 1600, both from Oxford University;
                            was MP for St Mawes in 1604 and for Hastings in 1626; and was knighted
                            in 1610. Carleton held important diplomatic posts: secretary in France
                            to Sir Thomas Parry, 1602; ambassador to Venice, 1610 (he lived abroad
                            in Venice and The Hague, 1610–25); ambassador to the Netherlands,
                            1616-25; vice-chamberlain of the Household and privy councillor, 1625-8;
                            and secretary of state, 1628. In 1626 he became Baron Carleton of
                            Imbercourt (thus a member of the Peerage), and was created Viscount
                            Dorchester in July 1628. A strong Calvinist, he worked as an anti-papist
                            and religionist on behalf of the king while in Europe. He also became an
                            important collector of Italian art, both for himself and others. Though
                            twenty years apart, he and Chamberlain developed a strong, life-long
                            bond of friendship and trust. He often sought Chamberlain’s counsel.
                            Most of Chamberlain’s letters are addressed to Carleton. See

                            and his family, was built in 1516. It was said to be a massive and
                            imposing moated house in Little Saxham, a very small village three miles
                            from Bury. One of Crofts’ descendents had it torn down in 1773. Crofts
                            had eleven children and at least fifteen grandchildren. His eight

                        <ab type="edDesc"> Shrovetide, a moveable feast determined by Easter, is the
                            days immediately preceding Lent. It runs from Septuagesima Sunday
                            through Shrove Tuesday, which in our time has also come to be known as
                            Mardi Gras. Though a time of preparation for Lent, Shrovetide was also a
                            time for revelling that ranged from sports and customary games that were
                            often treated as costumed symbolic enactments and processions
                            dramatizing the contest between cosmic good and satanic evil. Events
                            also might include plays. Shrove Tuesday is traditionally associated
                            with 'luxury and intemperance' and 'sportive foolery' (W.C. Hazlitt,
                                <title>Faiths and Foklore of the British Isles</title>, vol 2 (New
                            York, 1813), 545–6). Hazlitt quotes a writer who in 1620 described a
                            Shrovetide celebration in which a local man dressed in 'dreadful
                            colours' called his 'regiment' together and made 'an illiterate
                            oration,' which sounds similar to the mock musters that were common in
                            England during that time. Another author, writing in 1623, described the
                            Shrovetide leader in his parish as a 'corpulant commander' whose
                            adherents joined a procession, with some in maskes or disguises. Hazlitt
                            says that in 1512, clergy and officers of Lord Percy's Chapel performed
                            a play before the lord on Shrove Tuesday night. He cites other in-period
                            examples as well (<title>Faiths and Folklore</title>, pp 545-8). The
                            nature of the shroving at Little Saxham is unclear from Chamberlain's
                            letter, but the Crofts were a festive lot. Their masque for the king in
                            1620 had occurred, it appears, close upon Shrovetide. </ab>

                            the influence of his family, Sir Edmund became MP for Eye, Suffok in
                            1588-9 and MP for Suffolk in 1593 and 1625. He was high sheriff of
                            Suffolk in 1634. Sir Edmund married Philippa Wotton, daughter of the

                            children. Sir Edmund Bacon was succeeded as baronet of Redgrave by his
                            younger brother, Robert. The Suffolk village of Redgrave lies just south

                        </msIdentifier>
                        <ab type="edDesc">John Chamberlain (1554–1628) was one of early modern
                            England’s most prolific writers of personal correspondence (479 of his
                            letters survive, mainly to Sir Dudley Carleton and Sir Thomas Winwood).
                            Chamberlain was born in London and, except for occasional trips to
                            Europe and to the English countryside, lived his entire life in London.
                            Chamberlain’s father, Richard, was an alderman, sheriff of London, twice
                            master of the Worshipful Company of Ironmongers, and a member of the
                            Merchant Adventurers. Richard left his son John wealthy, and although
                            John attended Cambridge University at age sixteen, and was admitted to
                            Gray’s Inn in 1575 (but never to the bar), he left no evidence of a life
                            in the professions. He lived in several dwellings near St Paul’s
                            Cathedral during the last thirty years of his life, and spent his days

                        <ab type="edDesc"> Sir Dudley Carleton (1573/4–1631/2) was born at
                            Brightwell Baldwin, Oxfordshire, and buried at Westminster Abbey. He
                            received a BA in 1595, and an MA in 1600, both from Oxford University;
                            was MP for St Mawes in 1604 and for Hastings in 1626; and was knighted
                            in 1610. Carleton held important diplomatic posts: secretary in France
                            to Sir Thomas Parry, 1602; ambassador to Venice, 1610 (he lived abroad
                            in Venice and The Hague, 1610–25); ambassador to the Netherlands,
                            1616-25; vice-chamberlain of the Household and privy councillor, 1625-8;
                            and secretary of state, 1628. In 1626 he became Baron Carleton of
                            Imbercourt (thus a member of the Peerage), and was created Viscount
                            Dorchester in July 1628. A strong Calvinist, he worked as an anti-papist
                            and religionist on behalf of the king while in Europe. He also became an
                            important collector of Italian art, both for himself and others. Though
                            twenty years apart, he and Chamberlain developed a strong, life-long
                            bond of friendship and trust. He often sought Chamberlain’s counsel.
                            Most of Chamberlain’s letters are addressed to Carleton. See

                            <msName>Star Chamber Case: John Archer v. John Cole</msName>
                        </msIdentifier>
                        <ab type="edDesc">According to the first half of <rs ref="eats:452218"
                                type="Person_Male">John Cole's</rs> bill of complaint, this case
                            arose from a dispute between factions within the parish and an incident
                            in which two women (Susan and Grace Tubby) were imprisoned and whipped
                            for laughing at the minister during his sermon. In an earlier bill,
                            William Boyes the younger, of Stepney, Middlesex, an organist, had
                            charged that Cole and others, including several justices of the peace,
                            had manipulated the court to bring about the whippings of the young
                            women (apparently Boyes and the other plaintiffs lost that case). Cole's
                            bill, which counters the one by Boyes, claims that the witnesses for
                            Boyes (John Archer, clerk, of South Elmham St Cross, and Samuel Tubby,
                            tailor, of Spexhall) had perjured themselves in their claims against
                            Cole <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>. The second half of Cole's bill (here
                            transcribed) chronicles the subsequent vengeful actions by Boyes <hi
                                rend="italic">et al</hi> mainly involving the dissemination and
                            performance of the lengthy libellous song composed by Archer, which was
                            directed at George Battelly and Beatrice Breame. </ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> In his answer to Cole's charges, defendant Samuel Tulley
                            denies any involvement with the libellous song (TNA: STAC 8/109/13, item
                            1). John Archer, in his plea and demurrer, denies doing scandal and
                            defamation to John Dawling and his wife, or to George Battally or
                            Beatrice Breame, widow of William Breame. He claims that his earlier
                            examination by the court related to this case had found him guiltless
                            (TNA: STAC 8/109/13, item 2). TNA: STAC 8/109/13 is a composite document
                            made up of three attached items, numbered 1–3 by TNA, reflecting stages

                            Edmunds, and of the Drury and Gawdy families (he bequeathed £40 and a

                            likely a music tutor. His will identifies him as a gentleman who had
                            lands, houses, and considerable cash, all of which he bequeathed to

                            spite of its title, 'Liber Quintus' is the fourth surviving volume of
                            town books and is listed by SRO as the fourth manuscript book in the
                            series. Together, the four volumes constitute the most substantial body
                            of primary evidence for the study of borough life in Sudbury throughout
                            the Elizabethan and Stuart periods. For detailed discussion of Sudbury,

                                Norwich from 1575 through 1584. During his tenure he advocated
                                severely for the imposition of uniformity in the diocese, his
                                efforts including the trying and burning of a Norfolk workman for
                                heresy. Before Norwich Freke had been dean of Salisbury and
                                Rochester, bishop of Rochester, and archdeacon of Canterbury; after
                                Norwich he became bishop of Wocester and lord almoner.</p></note>

                                close in 1617 also remains unknown. The word merriment sounds
                                revels- like, with traditional activities that could range from
                                dancing to a May game to competitions. James I's <title>Book of
                                    Sports</title> was issued in 1617, so it seems possible that the
                                merriment was a response to that liberating edict. Holding the
                                merriment on the town close sounds as if the event might have been
                                intended to be both a public and a communal statement of cultural
                                ownership. <lb/><lb/> The small village of Weybread, eight and a
                                half miles east of the town of Eye, rests beside the River Waveney,
                                which forms the border with Norfolk. The village lies upon the
                                north-south Roman Road that essentially follows the modern B1116.
                                The population of Weybread was forty-one in 1066, thirty-four
                                taxpayers in 1327, fifty-two taxpayers in 1524, and 145 adults in
                                1603, and its ancient church of St Andrew has structural evidence
                                dating from the Norman period, as well as from the fourteenth and
                                fifteenth centuries. Archaeological finds show evidence of a

                            <msName>Star Chamber Case: Nicholas Rosyer, Tanner v. James Quarrye,
                                Carpenter, et al</msName>
                        </msIdentifier>
                        <ab type="edDesc">Nicholas Rosyer, the plaintiff who brought this case, was
                            a tanner who claimed that his family had lived in Wetherden for 200
                            years, though defendents said that he himself had previously lived
                            elsewhere. Rosyer's bill of complaint claims that he held freehold lands
                            and tenements within and near Wetherden and in other places as well. If
                            his claims are true, then he was a landlord of some means within the
                            area. His opponents in this suit, the defendants, represent a
                            cross-section of Wetherden: carpenter, yeoman, husbandman, widow, and at
                            least twenty others. While in his bill he describes himself as a dutiful
                            and peaceable subject and lover of his wife and family, the defendants
                            accuse him of vain ostentation, drunkenness, brawling and, together with
                            his father, degenerate disorder. The case involves a loud, noisy,
                            intermittently violent encounter on or near a Plough Monday. The
                            plaintiff describes the incident as a riot and an assault against his
                            wife; the defendants describe the incident as a skimmington mocking the
                            plaintiff for having been beaten by his wife. Witness answers to the
                            bill of complaint and to interrogatories provide an unusually detailed
                            description of the mimetic form of local 'justice' known as a
                            skimmington.</ab>

                            St Edmunds, who is thought to have been a patron of John Lydgate, the
                            monk and poet of the abbey of Bury. Baret's exceptionally lengthy will
                            left bequests and gifts of one size or another to nearly every citizen
                            (including prisoners) of the town of Bury and the abbey, as well as to
                            his kin and household, and to many of his friends and associates among
                            the gentry and the clergy in Suffolk and Norfolk. His will describes
                            every elaborate detail of his funeral service and interment, including
                            the theatrical element of a procession of five men, representing
                            Christ's wounds, and five women, representing the Virgin Mary's joys.
                            The instructions for his monument in the church of St Mary in Bury rival
                            those of a great nobleman who knew himself to be great. His will allots
                            but one line (and the gift of a gold ring) to his wife, Elizabeth Drury,
                            but delineates substantial bequests to 'John Alyn my chyld'; his
                            brother, William, of Cratfield; three nieces; a nephew; his cousin, Sir
                            John Cleye, who was a priest; plus too many other bequests to enumerate
                            usefully. The specifics of his bequests show him to have had numerous

                            Jerningham (<hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1510–72), eldest son of Edward
                            Jerningham of Somerleyton Hall, Suffolk. Her father was Sir George
                            Baynham of Clearwell, Gloucestershire, and she was certainly one of the
                            granddaughters of Sir William Kingston of Painswick, Gloucestershire, an
                            influential courtier, diplomat, and soldier who was favoured by Henry
                            VIII and was constable of the Tower of London during the reign of that
                            king. Frances' husband was a high and greatly trusted official in the
                            household of Mary Tudor and Frances was one of the Queen's ladies. In
                            her will, Frances bequeathed to her daughter, and thence to her
                            granddaughters, bracelets, a ruby ring, and numerous other valuable
                            pieces that had been given to Frances' mother, as Frances says, 'by a
                            Queene.' In addition to their home at Somerleyton, the Jerninghams
                            resided at Costessey near Norwich, in other counties, and at a mansion
                            in the Blackfriars in London which adjoined the site on which Richard
                            Burbages's theatre would later be built (TNA, PROB 11/66/340 1, pp

                        <ab type="edDesc">This record, the earliest mention of the game place in
                            Walsham as such, inadvertently confirms that it certainly existed by
                            1533, though the precise date (sometime between 1516 and 1533) on which
                            the site was transferred from the Berne family to someone else does not
                            survive in the court rolls. Dodd concludes that the feoffees of the
                            lands had acquired the playing site 'after 1516 for the specific purpose
                            of constructing such a theater,' which would indicate that the early
                            sixteenth century was a time of intense local theatrical activity in
                            Walsham ('Another Elizabethan Theater,' p 133). Whether villagers were
                            simply continuing a much older tradition is unclear. The Rickinghall
                            fragment indicates a dramatic tradition in a neighbouring hamlet at
                            least two hundred years earlier. </ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> Medieval Walsham was a large, wealthy village in
                            Blackbourn Hundred, West Suffolk, lying a roughly equidistant ten miles
                            (moving clockwise) from Diss in Norfolk, Stowmarket, Bury, and Thetford.
                            It is five miles from Ixworth, and Walsham's main west-to-east street is
                            part of the Ixworth to Finningham Road. The village has other roads to
                            numerous villages. It was thus ideally situated to engage in the
                            agricultural commerce and inter-parish enterprise that was, and remains,
                            its principal enterprise. At the same time, it had a skilled population
                            that included yeomen, husbandmen, cloth workers, shearmen, tanners, and
                            the like. Walsham's church of St Mary is centrally located at the
                            intersection of its main street and Church Way. The pre-Reformation
                            village had three religious guilds: St Trinity (1446), St John Baptist
                            (1446), and St Catherine (1521), and a guildhall. Its population was
                            listed as sixty-one residents in 1086, ninety taxpayers in 1283,
                            twenty-two taxpayers in 1327, sixty-seven taxpayers in 1524, 400-600
                            persons in 1577, and 3,400 adults in 1603 (Goult, <title>West

                            Buildings of Suffolk, to which are Added Gilds,' <title>Proceedings of
                                the Suffolk Institute of Archaeology</title> 19 (1925-6), 207. Ray
                            Lock describes it as within 'an area of dense and wealthy population'
                                (<title>Court Rolls</title>, p 1).</ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> On the eve of the Black Death in 1349, Walsham had its
                            largest population ever, but when the Black Death struck between March
                            and June of 1349, it killed half the town's citizens. The population of
                            the town would never again exceed its pre-plague numbers. The effects of
                            the Black Death were dire in other ways. Institutions in Walsham
                            remained intact, but many people who survived were forced to sell their
                            land, leaving many tenements and messuages abandoned. The decline of
                            villeinage accelerated. In spite of the ruin, in time Walsham recovered
                            (Bailey, <title>Medieval Suffolk</title>, pp 109, 177-83, 195; Dymond
                            and Northeast, <title>History of Suffolk</title>, p 48). Inconsistencies
                            used in identifying lands have led scholars to misidentify as many as
                            seven manors in Walsham, but court rolls confirm that Walsham had only
                            one fourteenth- century manor and two sub-manors. Walsham Manor,within
                            which lay the game place. The manor and High Hall sub-manor abutted each
                            other on a north-south border bisecting the village. Both entities had a
                            bewildering succession of lords, nearly all of them both non-resident
                            and minor gentry. However, during the years which saw the generation of
                            records related to the game place, the lords of Walsham Manor were
                            George Talbot (<hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1468-1538), fourth earl of
                            Shrewsbury, Charles Brandon Charles Brandon (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>
                            1484-1545), duke of Suffolk, and Sir Nicholas Bacon (1510-79) (Lock,
                                <title> Court Rolls of Walsham Le Willows</title>, pp 1-20). </ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> Lock describes Walsham as an 'unremarkable place' in that
                            it had no great religious house, no noble family, no industrial
                            development, and no cataclysmic political events (Lock, <title> Court
                                Rolls of Walsham Le Willows</title>, p 1). The lords of its three
                            manors appear to have exercised no absolute hegemonic control over the
                            village. Those qualities may offer some clues as to why Walsham might
                            have had a site used only for theatre. Though nominally a village,
                            Walsham acted like a town, governed by its laity and religious guilds.
                            In 1496 and 1497 the owner of the land that included Walsham's camping
                            close and playing site gave that land to the Church of Walsham to be
                            used, for its benefit, by the Guild of the Blessed Virgin Mary and by
                            the other guilds of the parish. </ab>

                        <ab type="edDesc">In a landmark article published in 1970, Kenneth M. Dodd
                            provided a comprehensive inventory of manorial documents that record the
                            tenurial history of the Walsham game place ('Another English Theater,'
                            pp 125–56). He starts with reference to the tenant, Thomas Berne,
                            senior, to whom in 1453 the lord of the manor granted nineteen acres,
                            fourteen and a half perches from four pieces of demesne lands - the
                            first piece of which would later be identified as a game place (Dodd,
                            'Another English Theater,' 127).</ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> Our entry from 1497 indicates that in that year Berne
                            gave a rood of his land to the church of Walsham for use to the benefit
                            of the guild of the Blessed Virgin Mary and the other guilds of the
                            parish. One year earlier (on 19 October 1496) he had also given a rood
                            from the first piece of his demesne lands for the same purposes. Except
                            for the fact that it lacks the names of the parish officials, the
                            wording of the 1496 document is essentially the same as the entry in

                            ('Another English Theater,' p 129). He speculates, quite reasonably,
                            that by 1497 the site was already being used by the town as its camping
                            close (see BL Add MS, 14850, f 175 below), a kind of place typically
                            used for recreations (the Walsham game place was specifically used to
                            present plays) in Suffolk. Norman Scarfe locates the Walsham game place
                            'on the north-west corner of the main crossroads in the village,
                            diagonally across the main street from St Mary's church, the
                            camping-close site of 1509.' While 'the 'round plan of this earthwork
                            seems to be recorded on Ordnance Survey maps as late as 1904,' the site,
                            he rightly says, is now covered by 'a large neo-Georgian house'

                        <ab type="edDesc"> Medieval Walsham was a large, wealthy village in
                            Blackbourn Hundred, West Suffolk, lying a roughly equidistant ten miles
                            (moving clockwise) from Diss in Norfolk, Stowmarket, Bury, and Thetford.
                            It is five miles from Ixworth, and Walsham's main west-to-east street is
                            part of the Ixworth to Finningham Road. The village has other roads to
                            numerous villages. It was thus ideally situated to engage in the
                            agricultural commerce and inter-parish enterprise that was, and remains,
                            its principal enterprise. At the same time, it had a skilled population
                            that included yeomen, husbandmen, cloth workers, shearmen, tanners, and
                            the like. Walsham's church of St Mary is centrally located at the
                            intersection of its main street and Church Way. The pre-Reformation
                            village had three religious guilds: St Trinity (1446), St John Baptist
                            (1446), and St Catherine (1521), and a guildhall. Its population was
                            listed as sixty-one residents in 1086, ninety taxpayers in 1283,
                            twenty-two taxpayers in 1327, sixty-seven taxpayers in 1524, 400-600
                            persons in 1577, and 3,400 adults in 1603 (Goult, <title>West

                        <ab type="edDesc"> On the eve of the Black Death in 1349, Walsham had its
                            largest population ever, but when the Black Death struck between March
                            and June of 1349, it killed half the town's citizens. The population of
                            the town would never again exceed its pre-plague numbers. The effects of
                            the Black Death were dire in other ways. Institutions in Walsham
                            remained intact, but many people who survived were forced to sell their
                            land, leaving many tenements and messuages abandoned. The decline of
                            villeinage accelerated. In spite of the ruin, in time Walsham recovered
                            (Bailey, <title>Medieval Suffolk</title>, pp 109, 177-83, 195; Dymond
                            and Northeast, <title>History of Suffolk</title>, p 48). Inconsistencies
                            used in identifying lands have led scholars to misidentify as many as
                            seven manors in Walsham, but court rolls confirm that Walsham had only
                            one fourteenth-century manor (Walsham Manor, within which lay the game
                            place) and two sub-manors. The manor and High Hall sub-manor abutted
                            each other on a north-south border bisecting the village. Both entities
                            had a bewildering succession of lords, nearly all of them both
                            non-resident and minor gentry. However, during the years which saw the
                            generation of records related to the game place, the lords of Walsham
                            Manor were George Talbot (<hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1468-1538), fourth
                            earl of Shrewsbury, Charles Brandon (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>
                            1484-1545), duke of Suffolk, and Sir Nicholas Bacon (1510-79) (Lock,
                                <title> Court Rolls of Walsham Le Willows</title>, pp 1-20). </ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> Lock describes Walsham as an 'unremarkable place' in that
                            it had no great religious house, no noble family, no industrial
                            development, and no cataclysmic political events (Lock, <title> Court
                                Rolls of Walsham Le Willows</title>, p 1). The lords of its manor
                            and two sub-manors appear to have exercised no absolute hegemonic
                            control over the village. Those qualities may offer some clues as to why
                            Walsham might have had a site used only for theatre. Though nominally a
                            village, Walsham acted like a town, governed by its laity and religious
                            guilds. In 1496 and 1497 the owner of the land that included Walsham's
                            camping close and playing site gave that land to the Church of Walsham
                            to be used, for its benefit, by the Guild of the Blessed Virgin Mary and
                            by the other guilds of the parish. </ab>

                            Walsham as such, inadvertently confirms that it certainly existed by
                            1533, though the precise date (sometime between 1516 and 1533) on which
                            the site was transferred from the Berne family to someone else does not
                            survive in the court rolls. Dodd concludes that the feoffees of the
                            lands had acquired the playing site 'after 1516 for the specific purpose
                            of constructing such a theater,' which would indicate that the early
                            sixteenth century was a time of intense local theatrical activity in
                            Walsham ('Another Elizabethan Theater,' p 133). Whether villagers were
                            simply continuing a much older tradition is unclear. The Rickinghall
                            fragment indicates a dramatic tradition in a neighbouring hamlet at
                            least two hundred years earlier. </ab>

                            place in Walsham after 1533, though the precise date (sometime between
                            1516 and 1533) on which the site was transferred from the Berne family
                            to someone else does not survive in the court rolls. Dodd concludes that
                            the feoffees of the lands had acquired the playing site 'after 1516 for
                            the specific purpose of constructing such a theater,' which would
                            indicate that the early sixteenth century was a time of intense local
                            theatrical activity in Walsham ('Another Elizabethan Theater,' p 133).
                            Whether villagers were simply continuing a much older tradition is
                            unclear. The Rickinghall fragment indicates a dramatic tradition in a
                            neighbouring hamlet at least two hundred years earlier. </ab>

                            (moving clockwise) from Diss in Norfolk, Stowmarket, Bury, and Thetford.
                            It is five miles from Ixworth, and Walsham's main west-to-east street is
                            part of the Ixworth to Finningham Road. The village has other roads to
                            numerous villages. It was thus ideally situated to engage in the
                            agricultural commerce and inter-parish enterprise that was, and remains,
                            its principal enterprise. At the same time, it had a skilled population
                            that included yeomen, husbandmen, cloth workers, shearmen, tanners, and
                            the like. Walsham's church of St Mary is centrally located at the
                            intersection of its main street and Church Way. The pre-Reformation
                            village had three religious guilds: St Trinity (1446), St John Baptist
                            (1446), and St Catherine (1521), and a guildhall. Its population was
                            listed as sixty-one residents in 1086, ninety taxpayers in 1283,
                            twenty-two taxpayers in 1327, sixty-seven taxpayers in 1524, 400-600

                            place) and two sub-manors. The manor and High Hall sub-manor abutted

                            <msName>Letter from Thomas Wylley, Vicar of Yoxford, to Thomas Cromwell,
                                Lord Privy Seal</msName>
                        </msIdentifier>
                        <ab type="edDesc">This letter illustrates, and was written within the
                            contexts of, the intensifying religious conflict that crystallized
                            between religious conservatives and radical reformists in Suffolk
                            between 1530 and 1540, and which continued well beyond. The forces of
                            reform were inspired locally by clerics from Cambridge and by sea-faring
                            merchants (many from Ipswich) whose trade with the Low Countries brought
                            them into contact with Protestantism, anti- clericalism, and humanist
                            ideas. Reflecting intense support for the Crown, reform-minded gentry
                            gathered around Charles Brandon, duke of Suffolk, and his strongly
                            Protestant wife, Katherine Willoughby, in opposition to conservative
                            clergy. The King's chief religious advisor, Thomas Cromwell, lord privy
                            seal, also advanced the King's agenda by observing conservative clergy
                            and reporting them to the Crown (thus Willey's appeal to him). As
                            Diarmaid MacCulloch observes, the year of this letter (1537) was a time
                            when 'public confrontations between radicals and conservatives in the
                            county were becoming frequent occurences' (<title>Suffolk and the

                            reflects MacCulloch's influence, notably pp 157-63). </ab>

                            four miles north of Saxmundham. The author of the letter was the vicar
                            of the church of St Peter in the parish of Yoxford, in the deanery of
                            Dunwich. At the time of the letter, Yoxford had approximately 60
                            taxpayers and the vicarage was valued at £5 14s 2d. Late in the century
                            the parish recorded fifteen non-conformists among its parishioners
                            (Goult, <title>West Suffolk</title>, np). As the letter can testify,
                            Willey's radical reformist voice received scant welcome from the clergy
                            of nearby parishes. Where his reformist plays were performed, if at all,

                            During the fourteenth century a second court (the Court of Petty Pleas)
                            emerged out of the fading Portmanmote, and by 1377, that court had, in
                            reality, supplanted the Portmanmote. In the early fifteenth century the
                            Portmanmote formally split into two entities, giving us the essential
                            features of the post-medieval court system in Ipswich. While the
                            Portmanmote preserved its real actions (mainly to do with land and
                            properties), an entity called the Great Court (or General Court)
                            emerged. It was a purely administrative court, and it became the supreme
                            authority in non-judicial matters in Ipswich. The court turned over much
                            of its power to the Assembly, a body composed of the bailiffs, the
                            twelve portmen, and the twenty-four members of the Common Council,
                            acting on recommendations made by the Assembly (Allen, <title>Ipswich

                        <ab type="edDesc">The idiosyncratic system of courts in Ipswich unusually
                            conducted the early town's governance (both judicial and
                            administrative). That system evolved away from its original form over
                            time, as did the system for keeping those courts' records. The earliest
                            iteration of record keeping, which ended in the early fifteenth century,
                            was a series of court rolls kept separately for each of the town's three
                            courts: initially the Portmanmote/Great Court, the Petty Court, and the
                            Petty Court of Recognizances. The Portmanmote/Great Court treated of
                            admissions, pleas related to tenants, recoveries of properties, and
                            other major actions (Allen, <title>Ipswich Borough Archives</title>, pp
                            41-3; much of the information in this headnote is gleaned from Allen).
                            The Petty Court (or Court of Petty Pleas) (fines, bonds for good
                            behavior, and other business of the town) 'touched almost every aspect
                            of life in the gown and became 'the borough's principal judicial organ'
                            (Geoffrey Martin, 'The Borough and the Merchant Community of Ipswich,
                            1317-1422,' D.Phil. thesis, Oxford University, 1955, cited in Allen,
                                <title>Ipswich Borough Archives</title>, p 58). The Petty Court of
                            Recognizances was essentially 'a register of titles to property within
                            the liberties of the borough' (Allen, p 73).</ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> With the collapse of that system of record keeping in the
                            late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries, there followed 'an
                            interval of apparent confusion, and the emergence of the series of
                            Composite Enrolments' and one surviving Composite Court Book (London,
                            British Library, Additional MS 30158) (Allen, p 157). The Composite
                            Enrolment Rolls entered 'on a single roll the significant business of
                            all the courts except the Sessions' (Allen, <title>Ipswich Borough
                                Archives</title>, p 158). In this roll, which is the first of those
                            composite enrolments, its organization is 'haphazard' and
                            unchronological. Its contents encompass recognizances, actions of the
                            Clerk, petty pleas, and the business of the General Court, which
                            included ordinances, elections (including those of the Guild of Corpus
                            Christi), admissions, grants, and leases (Allen, p 158).<lb/>
                            <lb/> The Composite Court Books, in fact, 'bear all the characteristics
                            of rough minute books.' Their most important items would later be
                            'enrolled in detail' in the series of Composite Enrolments (C/2/10/1-85
                            in period; listed in Allen, <title>Ipswich Borough Archives</title>, pp
                            158-79). Composite Court books recorded the proceedings of the Petty
                            Court ('the principal borough court') and, to a lesser extent, of the
                            other courts in the town. Entries range from pleas of all kinds to deeds
                            to oaths of admission and appointment to apprenticeship indentures, to
                            every other manner of civil action. The twenty-two volumes of Composite
                            Court Books range from 1486 through 1601 (Allen, <title>Ipswich Borough

                            its nave and tower arch) date from the eleventh and twelfth centuries,
                            its main tower from 1300, and its aisles from the fourteenth century.
                            The present Polstead Hall, located west of the church, is a
                            timber-framed structure dating from the sixteenth century. No evidence
                            of an earlier hall is mentioned in available sources (Birch, <title>

                        <ab type="edDesc">Polstead Manor dates from the twelfth century. When the
                            lord of the manor, Thomas de Lambourne, died in 1361, followed by the
                            death of his son and heir William in the following year, the manor
                            passed to Thomas's sister, the wife of William de Cheyne (or Chene)
                            (1334–75). The lordship passed to his son, Roger de Cheyne (1362–1414),
                            who would have been lord at the time of the summer game in 1381. The
                            family held Polstead Manor for life on behalf of the king, however,
                            there is no evidence that Roger de Cheyne actually took possession of
                            Polstead Manor (see <title>HPO</title>

                        <ab type="edDesc">While early tournaments were militaristic training in
                            their purpose and nature, their successors, the 'hastiludi' or jousts,
                            were more performative in nature. During the reign of Edward III (who
                            loved them), 'hastiludi' became part of the fabric of courtly
                            performance, game and display (Richard Barber, <title>Edward III and the
                                Triumph of England: The Battle of Crécy and the Company of the
                                Garter</title> (London, 2013), 68). As Barber shows, by the time of
                            these records, hastiludi characteristically built themselves around
                            themes (often Arthurian) becoming 'as much festival as tournament'
                                (<title>Edward III</title>, p 69). What participants (including
                            audience) wore functioned as costume (reflecting the theme) as much as
                            clothing. Everyone in the event (both 'combatants' and observors, men
                            and women alike, were, in fact also playing characters. Processional
                            elements were also thematic enactments, with participants riding in
                            pairs in the party of their 'captain,' and was accompanaied by 'trumpets
                            and a variety of other instruments' (Barber, <title>Edward III</title>,
                            p 70). Hastiludi also had complex political and diplomatic purposes, as
                            Barber details (<title>Edward III</title>, p 71). Of relevance to this
                            collection, everything in a courtly tournament during the reign of
                            Edward III (including the lavish expenditures for dress) was part of a
                            mimesis, designed to reflect the king's view of himself as the new
                            Arthur (Barber, <title>Edward III</title>, pp 72-95). The hastiludium in
                            Bury in 1348, one assumes, would have been no exception to that pattern.

                            during a day of great celebration of nuptials leading up to the couple's
                            wedding ceremony on 8 January.</ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> The entertainer Matilda Makejoy, a court favorite,
                            performed in a place called the hall of the king; otherwise none of the
                            entries identify a venue. As Wodderspoon says, the location and nature
                            of that hall 'are now lost to us' (<title>Memorials</title>, p 252). He
                            offers several speculations. The King's Hall could have been: a
                            temporary structure built for the occasion (unlikely given the season);
                            the Town House, the Toll House, or the Moot Hall; or a hall in one of
                            the numerous priories in Ipswich. Wodderspoon seems justified in saying
                            that the hall 'must have been of no mean proportions, but sufficiently
                            large to have accomodated a numerous company, who, from their gambols
                            needed room for sport' (Memorials, 252-3). The audience too would have
                            been considerable. The king spent a lot of time in the Priory of St
                            Peter and Paul during his visit (likely because of its associations with
                            his late father), and the wedding ceremony was held in the King's Chapel
                            there. Further, there was a castle in Ipswich in the twelfth century
                            which might have served, but its size, structure, and location are
                            unknown. The matter remains murky.</ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> The young Count of Holland had been raised from infancy
                            in England. He and Elizabeth had been betrothed to each other in April
                            1285, when he was but one year old, and she but three. At the time of
                            their wedding in Ipswich, John was twelve and Elizabeth was fourteen.
                            Their precipitous marriage appears to have been occasioned by the murder
                            of John's father, Floris V that year, making John 1 ruler of his
                            country.</ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> Following the wedding, John returned to Holland, but, as
                            it happened, his reluctant bride refused to accompany him, remaining in
                            England during 1297 in the care of her family. In 1298 she finally
                            joined her young husband, but he died a year later. Officially, he was
                            said to have succumbed to dysentry, but it was widely believed that he
                            had been murdered.</ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc"> On 14 November 1302 (at the age of twenty), Elizabeth
                            married Humphrey de Bohun, fourth earl of Hertford, third Earl of Essex,
                            and constable of England. She died, along with Isabel, the youngest of
                            her eleven children with de Bohun, in childbirth, on 5 May 1316.</ab>

                        </msIdentifier>
                        <ab type="edDesc">John Benale, draper, of Bury St Edmunds, was a man of some
                            wealth and influence, who was survived by his wife, who is identified in
                            the MS as 'loue' or 'lone' (perhaps the copyist's error for 'Jone'), and
                            his sons John, Robert and Thomas. He left his principal house and all
                            its substantial household possessions to his wife. His will alludes to
                            other of his lands and tenements, both within Bury and elsewhere, but
                            offers no details concerning them. He bequeathed generous amounts of
                            cash to his wife, sons, and godchildren; to numerous members of what
                            appears to have been a considerable household staff (including his
                            servant, apprentice, and many other individuals); to the supervisor and
                            executors of his will; and to the abbey and a number of its members.
                            Notably, he promises assistance to his eldest son, John, if he decides
                            to attend either Cambridge or Oxford.</ab>

                        <ab type="edDesc">Benale clearly enjoyed close and pious associations with
                            both the Abbey and his parish church. For example, he received a license
                            to be buried in the chauncel of St Mary Parish Church from the Sacristan
                            of the Abbey, whom he referred to as 'my maister Sacristan.' In addition
                            to the money that he left to the Abbey and several of its members, he
                            left similar bequests to the Parish Church of St Mary and its parish
                            priest.</ab>

                        <ab type="edDesc">As his will indicates, the guild of St John Baptist in
                            Bury entrusted him with the care of garments used in the guild's revel
                            on St Edmund's night, and that he, in turn, entrusted those same
                            garments to John Basse. That the owner of the garments was not Benale
                            but the guild itself offers compelling evidence that the revel (whatever
                            its particulars) was likely part of a cooperative performance tradition
                            involving the town and the abbey already established well before 1494.
                            For a useful perspective on Benele and this tradition, see Gibson,

                        <ab type="edDesc">John Sexten's occupation is not given in his will, but he
                            was a member of a prominent cloth-making family in Lavenham. He left a
                            nuncupative will (spoken on his death bed), and a registered form of
                            that will, from which the extract below is taken. His will mentions no
                            wife or children among his heirs. Instead, he left much of his estate to
                            his three brothers (Alan, Thomas and Robert) and his cousin, Robert
                            Critofte, to whom he bequeathed all his considerable masking gear (see
                            transcription). Items that he bequeathed to his brothers indicate that
                            he was a person of significant means. His possessions bequeathed to them
                            included money; rings and other silver and gilt items; clothing;
                            wall-hangings; a canopied bed; and painted portraits of Queen Mary,
                            Philip of Spain, Henry VIII, and 'the emp<ex>er</ex>or' (presumably
                            Charles V). He also gave generous but smaller bequests to other
                            relatives and several servants. His gift of all his masking gear to his
                            cousin, Robert Critofte, indicates that he was involved in a socially
                            rarified theatrical tradition in Lavenham. For detailed discussion of
                            Sexten's will, and of his family in the history of Lavenham, see Dymond,

                        <ab type="edDesc">The will of Thomas Pykerell identifies him as a resident
                            of Bury, but does not identify his trade. He was survived by his wife,
                            Beatrice (his principal heir), and his daughter, Agnes. His will states
                            his wish to be buried in the sepulchre, but fails to mention of which
                            church (although it was the parish church of either St Mary or St
                            James). Pykerell had three tenements in Bury. The first, where he and
                            his wife dwelt, was located in 'the Rowes <gap reason="omitted"/>
                            sumtyme called Cutlers.' The Rows were seven small streets close by the
                            entrance to the abbey, each one named for a trade (Anthony Breen,
                                <title>The Bury Rental 1526 and 1547</title> (Ipswich, 2000), pp 44,
                            57.) Since none of the seven rows is named Cutler, the word as used here
                            could refer either to a former holder of the tenement or to a
                            now-defunct guild. More specifically, this first tenement of Pykerell
                            (later belonging to his neighbors John and Isabell Tyler) lay on
                            Goldsmiths and Glovers Streets, two very short adjoining rows merging
                            into each other and lying immediately in front of the abbey, between St
                            James and St Mary churches (Breen, <title>Bury Rental</title>, pp 34,
                            36). Pykerell bequeathed this house and all its appurtenances to his
                            wife.</ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc">Pykerell's second tenement lay on Reynegate (or Raingate)
                            Street, which ends at the base of Honey Hill and the Shire Hall, within
                            steps of the Great Churchyard and the abbey grounds. Pykerell also
                            bequeathed this second house and its appurtenances to his wife.</ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc">Pykerell's third house lay on an unspecified plot in
                            Westgate Street, which runs from the West Gate of the town to St May's
                            Square, which is within a short distance of the Great Churchyard. His
                            will requested that this third house be consigned to his executors to
                            sell, half the proceeds going to the parish church of St Mary and half
                            to his wife.</ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc">Although brief, Pykerell's bequest of his playing garments
                            provides considerable information about the local playing tradition in
                            medieval Bury. Immediately preceding the extracted passage, Pykerell
                            bequeathed his best gown to John Tyler. The proximity of the two
                            bequests (gown and playing garments), and their similarity to bequests
                            in the <ref target="https://ereed.org/records/suffk-rid668/">will of
                                John Benale</ref> strongly suggest that Pykerell was a member of the
                            Guild of St John Baptist. Pykerell's use of the word 'all' suggests that
                            he had considerably more playing garments than the two gowns of
                            Benale.</ab>
                        <ab type="edDesc">Gibson very usefully identifies the frater (where the play
                            was held) as 'the refrectory or monk's dining hall.' As seen in a map of
                            1748, which shows the frater's precise location, it was 'a rectangular
                            stone building just to the north of the abbey cloister and adjacent to
                            the monk's dormitory.' According to William of Worcester who recorded
                            the dimensions of the frater in 1479, it was '90 paces long (about 171
                            feet) and 40 feet wide,' a performance venue of some size (Gibson, 'Play
                            of "Wisdom",' pp 115-16, 206 n 39).</ab>

                            the sixty-year head lease of the six contiguous fields comprising

                            parish of Newington in their manor of Walworth. The lease was redemised
                            to him on 29 September 1573, with the additional stipulation that he
                            maintain the common drainage sewer running alongside and any bridges

                            until the following Easter because of the plague, but with no specific
                            playing places named. The second, on 1 August 1577, was more precise,
                            citing "the theater and such like" as examples of places to be closed.

                            drainage and the prevention of flooding, not with the removal of sewage
                            in the modern sense. In 1531 an Act of Sewers was passed which set out
                            in great detail the duties and powers of Commissioners and governed
                            their work until the 19th century. Gradually a permanent pattern emerged
                            in the London area of seven commissions, five north and two south of the
                            Thames, with, after the Great Fire, a separate commission for the City

                            Commissioners of Sewers were issued in 1554. Its minutes begin in 1570
                            and it was the earliest of the London Commissions to be established on
                            an organised basis. The area of its jurisdiction ran from East Molesey
                            in Surrey to the River Ravensbourne, and included Lambeth, Southwark,
                            Bermondsey, Newington, Deptford, Rotherhithe, Clapham, Battersea,

                            of his original lease of thirty-five acres. Hickes was thereby granted a
                            new lease for twenty-one years to begin at Michaelmas 1573. The reason
                            for the redemise and renegotiated time frame remains unexplained. A

                            and distributed among U4, U5, U6, U7, and Y2. Only 44 folios for 15, 20,

                            appendix; i+383+36 (paper); dimensions extremely variable: parchment
                            approximately 285mm x 205mm (ruled space appoximately 238 mm x 145 mm),
                            ff 333-40, approximately 270 mm x 175mm (203mm x 133mm), number of lines
                            variable; (1) the <hi rend="italic">maior registrum</hi> gatherings A-Z,
                            mainly 4 and 6s, no signatures apparent, (2) the <hi rend="italic">novum
                                registrum</hi> gatherings a-q, 2s and 6s, signatures a-k, with gaps
                            due to wear and trimming, (3) index, 10 gatherings of 2, except
                            gathering 8, a singlet, and ff 35 and 36, detached leaves. Many inserted
                            leaves, especially in the first 7 gatherings of (1) and gathering c of
                            (2); frequent correction by later hands, cancellations, marginal
                            notations in both contemporary and later hands; modern foliation at the
                            foot of the leaf in pencil, treating (1) and (2) together, (3)
                            separately, as do the 2 medieval folaitons, at the head of the leaf in
                            ink. The medieval numberings show the original division of the
                            manuscript: the first, 1-246, is overlapped by the second, 200
                            (beginning on the original 190) - 370, many cross references between
                            sections, no medieval foliation in (3); little ornamentation in script;
                            bound in white paper-covered boards resembling leather, red label on
                            spine with title CITY OF YORK / - / REGISTER OF / VARIOUS MEMORANDA /
                            RELATING TO CITY / - / 1327-1547. Beneath the label is A/Y, then 20. The
                            manuscript has been heavily damaged bu flooding, writing legible only
                            under ultra-violet light on many leaves, in some entries (see the 1415
                            'Ordo' gathering) ink completely washed away, decipherable only in
                            strong sunlight when outline of letters in clean parchment contrasts
                            with surrounding darkened surface. </ab>
