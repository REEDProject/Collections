                <p>Records of Early English Drama (REED) is an international scholarly project that
                    is establishing for the first time the context from which the drama of
                    Shakespeare and his contemporaries grew. Founded in 1976, REED has worked since
                    then to locate, transcribe, and edit historical documents containing evidence of
                    drama, secular music, and other communal entertainment and ceremony from the
                    Middle Ages until 1642, when the Puritans closed the London theatres.</p>

                        <ab type="edDesc">John of Gaunt's two register books contain various orders,
                            including orders for payments, letters, and many other types of official
                            records concerning the running of the vast duchy of Lancaster. Some of
                            the orders are addressed to borough and other local officials within the
                            duchy, and deal with local arrangements. The register books also contain
                            a vast amount of material about the running of Gaunt's various
                            households in England, as far-flung as Bamburgh, Leicester, Kenilworth,
                            Kingston Lacy, Hertford, and the Savoy, as well as others in Europe.
                            Records of his payments for minstrels and other entertainers have been
                            transcribed, wherever activities or payments for them may have occurred,
                            because the administrative centres of the duchy appear to have been
                            Tutbury and Kenilworth. The register books have been published as

                            officers and admissions of burgesses. After this there occurs a gap
                            until 1490–1510, when the records again consist of elections,

                            1611 onwards, so they presumably were copied by the town clerk or his

                            between 13 February and 19 March. The mayoral accounting year was later

                            including orders for payments, letters, and many other types of official
                            records concerning the running of the vast duchy of Lancaster. Some of
                            the orders are addressed to borough and other local officials within the
                            duchy, and deal with local arrangements. Two such excerpts deal with
                            Newcastle under Lyme and Tutbury, and hence the register books are fully
                            described above, under those boroughs. The register books also contain a
                            vast amount of material about the running of Gaunt's various households
                            in England, as far-flung as Bamburgh, Leicester, Kenilworth, Kingston
                            Lacy, Hertford, and the Savoy, as well as others in Europe. Records of
                            his payments for minstrels and other entertainers have been transcribed,
                            wherever activities or payments for them may have occurred, because the
                            administrative centres of the duchy appear to have been Tutbury and

                            [a/b] and [c/d], the two variant versions of the orders. It is assumed
                            that [a], the version of the orders which cannot be precisely dated, is
                            earlier because it is a re-issue (with minor changes, errors, and
                            omissions) of the orders of 1618 (TNA: DL 41/587). Presumably the letter
                            of 7 May 1630, [b], was intended to accompany this version of the
                            orders. It could not have been intended for the orders dated later, the
                            revised orders of 10 May 1630 (1631?), item [c]. These revised orders
                            presumably reflect changes ordered by the new chancellor of the duchy of
                            Lancaster, Edward Barrett, Lord Newburgh, who held office from April
                            1629 concurrently with his predecessor, Sir <rs

                            May's death in June 1630 likely caused some upheaval in the workings of
                            the Chancery office, and may account for the confusion in dates with
                            this version of the orders. In any case there appears to have been a
                            delay of a little over a year before the revised orders, item [c], were
                            issued, along with item [d], Newburgh's letter of 21 May 1631 ordering
                            that the orders be exemplified and enforced. However, the existence of
                            an exemplification dated 10 May 1630 (1631?) may indicate that
                            Newburgh's letter was related to yet another recension of the orders,
                            now lost. The relationships between these variant versions, one
                            concludes, are not at all clear.</ab>

                            in Staffordshire Record Office for consultation by arrangement. It
                            contains annual churchwardens' accounts, presented usually at Lady Day
                            or Mid-Lent Sunday each year; in most cases the date of presentation
                            specifies the calendar year. This is assumed to have been in Old Style
                            and the year has been corrected accordingly (for example, 1520 has been
                            given as 1520/1). There are several cases in which both the calendar and
                            regnal year are specified; in these the year appears to be given in New
                            Style and has not been corrected. The handwriting, presumably that of
                            the parish clerk, changes several times in the course of the years

                                William Macray for the Historical Manuscript Commission in 1888
                                ('Corporation of Reading,' pp 167–227). Fourteen rolls before 1413
                                seen by Macray are no longer extant. Those for 1363–4, 1366–7,
                                1367–8, 1378–9, and 1384–5 were used by Norman Gibbs in his Oxford
                                doctoral thesis in 1935. All had disappeared by 1960 (Slade,
                                    <title>Reading Gild Accounts</title>, pt 1, pp xvii–xxii). There
                                has been speculation that the disappearance was as a result of enemy
                                action during the Second World War when Reading, by then an
                                important railway centre, was heavily bombed. Macray does not record
                                the accounting year, but later MS evidence indicates that it was
                                Michaelmas to Michaelmas. </p></note>

                                received the living of <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/86856/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Bishopstoke</rs> in Hampshire 26 June 1551, when
                                the strongly Protestant John Ponet (a supporter of Northumberland)
                                was made bishop of Winchester in place of the more moderate Stephen
                                Gardiner (<title>ODNB</title>). King Edward nominated Bale to be
                                <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/3558/" type="Collective_ClergyAndChurchwardens">bishop of Ossory</rs> in October 1552 and he was consecrated in February
                                1553, so the planned performance of Bale's <title><rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/84974/" type="Drama_TitledWork">Three Laws</rs></title>
                                criticized by the papist must have occurred in 1551 or 1552
                                    (<title>ODNB</title>; Happé, <title>Bale</title>, pp 17–18).
                                Scholars have not been able to identify this papist, as Bale does
                                not name him, nor does Bale identify the 'gentylman af hys owne
                                affynyte' in whose house the papist resided, or the papist's
                                chaplain, who is an 'allyen, an Armoricall or frenche Britayne,' or
                                the servant who was going to act in Bale's <title>Three Laws</title>
                                (Happé, <title>Bale</title>, p 42; John Bale, <title>An

                                Either Bale assumed Northumberland would know to whom the pamphlet
                                referred, or their identities did not matter to Bale, as the
                                individuals' actions merely provided Bale with an opportunity to
                                express his vitriolic anti- Catholic rhetoric. <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1967/" type="Place_County">Hampshire</rs> had plenty
                                of Catholic-leaning gentlemen, many of whom would remain recusants
through <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/11772/" type="Person_Royalty">Queen Elizabeth's</rs> reign. Moreover, Bale does not make clear
                                whether the play performance was to take place at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/86856/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Bishopstoke</rs>, where
                                the bishop of Winchester had a residence, at the bishop's palace at
                                <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/107136/" type="Place_Feature">Wolvesey</rs> in <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/79157/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Winchester</rs>, or somewhere else. Thus it is difficult to
                                pinpoint the household of a Catholic gentleman whose servant was to
                                perform in Bale's play.<lb/></p></note>

                            undated and unlocated, but it comes from the Jervoise of Herriard
                            collection at the Hampshire Record Office. The hand is late sixteenth to
                            early seventeenth century and a note on the verso, 'what I have reseved

                            it is possible that the parish involved is St Nicholas', <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/106707/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Freefolk</rs>, where
                            Paulet is buried. He held the manor of Freefolk as well as Herriard, and

                            it could also be Roger Tegg, from whom Guidott received funds. William Guidott succeeded James Samborne as steward for Thomas Jervoise. The

                            appears below this memorandum and elsewhere in the accounts. The
                            accounts are mostly for expenses while away from the main household, at

                            Jervoise of Britford, Wiltshire, but he was orphaned at an early age and
                            in 1601 Sir <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/113645/" type="Person_Gentry">Richard Paulet</rs> purchased Jervoise's wardship from the Crown.
                            Paulet had no son and after Jervoise married Paulet's daughter, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/115611/" type="Person_Gentry">Lucy</rs>, he
                            became Paulet's heir. At Paulet's death in 1614 Jervoise succeeded to
                            Paulet's estates at Herriard and Freefolk, Hampshire, and continued to
                            reside in the county, though he had also inherited estates in Wiltshire
                            and Shropshire from his father. He was knighted in 1607 and from 1621 to
                            his death he served Whitchurch in parliament, supporting the
                            Parliamentary side in the Civil War. <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/116870/" type="Person_Commoner">William Guidott</rs> acted as steward of

                            from his great uncle Thomas Walshe in 1593. The manuscript begins with
                            records of the manor court of Hill Croome for 1506 and ends with a 1601
                            survey of the lands which Paulet's adopted son and heir <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/115534/" type="Person_Gentry">Thomas Jervoise</rs>
                            inherited from his father. The item on f [46v] is a copy of Richard
                            Paulet's 1582 recognizance to pay his sister <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/134147/" type="Person_Gentry">Elizabeth</rs> £20 when she
                            comes of age or marries. The manuscript thus seems to be a collection of
                            records concerning Richard Paulet's lands and finances, but the records
                            have been copied by several different hands and are not arranged in
                            chronological order, so they give little indication of the date or
                            origin of the play description. The two different hands of the play
                            description are both late 16th century. The two folios of the play
                            description (ff [12] and [13]) are written upside down in relation to
                            the rest of the manuscript. (f [12v] is written right side up in a
                            different hand from the play description, and is a survey of the manor
                            of Stockton, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/2399/" type="Place_County">Worcestershire</rs>, which Paulet also inherited from Thomas
                            Walshe.) The list of virtues and vices on f [13] is written in a
                            different hand from the summary on f [12], but the two are linked by the
                            word 'Triumph' at the top of both, and several of the virtues in the
                            list appear in the summary.</ab>

                            cover of the manuscript are due to the fact that it was originally held
                            in the college library, then was deposited in the Bodleian Library in
                            the 1890s, returned to Corpus Christi in 1984, and then transferred from
                            the college library to the college archives. Henry Coxe (comp),

                                hodie Adservantur</title>, vol 2 (Oxford, 1852), 183, lists the
                            manuscript as Corpus Christi College MS CCCLXXVI. The manuscript has
                            been a good deal damaged and repaired. Some leaves survive intact, some
                            only damaged at edges, not affecting the written text, but some are very
                            extensively damaged so that only a half to a third of the leaf remains.
                            The receipts are often dominated by the sale of one tod of wool. The
                            accounts survive in a fairly orderly chronological run from 1541 to
                            1607, though the accounts for 1553 to 1555 are missing. Then there is a
                            gap until 1619 and from that point the accounts are summary only to
                            1656. At the end of the manuscript is a list of rates for the Holy Loaf
                            in a late sixteenth-century hand. This manuscript was formerly
                            identified by the shelfmark 376.</ab>

                                Chambers, <title>Elizabethan Stage</title>, vol 4, pp 105–6). Odiham
                                had long been a royal residence, so the fact that Hertford's small
                                house and lands at Elvetham lay only four miles from Odiham meant
                                Elvetham would have to serve if Hertford were going to have the
                                chance to entertain the queen in 1591. Many of the two hundred
                                artificers employed at Elvetham must have come from Tottenham, as
                                did one Edmund Pike, who wrote the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/3576/" type="Collective_ClergyAndChurchwardens">churchwardens</rs> of Great Bedwyn,
                                <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/2381/" type="Place_County">Wiltshire</rs>, explaining that he could not meet with them on 25 August
                                1591, as he was aiding his master, the earl of Hertford, with his
                                preparations 'agaynst her ma<ex>ies</ex>ties com<ex>m</ex>ynge to

                                description of the pageantry at Elvetham was entered in the
                                Stationer's Register on 1 October by the printer John Wolfe of
                                London and issued as a quarto pamphlet: 'THE HONORABLE Entertainment
                                gieuen to the Quenes Maiestie in Progresse, at Eluetham in
                                Hampshire, by the right Honorable the Earle of Hertford.' No author
                                is named on the title page, but the description of the events
                                appears to have been written by a member of Hertford's household: he
                                consistently refers to Hertford as 'my Lord' in the first printed
                                version of the text (Q1; see below) and the substantive changes made
                                in the later, corrected printing (Q2) reflect first-hand knowledge
                                of the event. Some of the songs are known from other sources to have
                                been written by Thomas Watson, while the Phyllida and Coridon song
                                is known to be by Nicholas Breton. Earlier editors have offered a
                                number of other names as authors of part or all of the text, but
                                their arguments are highly speculative. <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/213249/" type="Person_Commoner">Thomas Morley</rs> is credited in
                                the text as composer of one of the pavanes performed on the first
                                evening, and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/34466/" type="Person_Commoner">William Byrd</rs> is among those who may have contributed to
                                the music (Davies, 'Queen's Entertainment at Elvetham,' pp
                                568–9).</p><p> Four copies of the pamphlet have survived. Three copies
                                are similar: BL: C.33.c.7.(9.), Cambridge University Library:
                                Bb.11.50 (E), and Lambeth Palace Library: ZZ.1593.28.97. In his
                                edition of the entertainment for the new edition of Nichols'
                                    <title>Progresses</title>, Davies designates these three copies
                                as Q1 and details the minor differences between them ('Queen's
                                Entertainment at Elvetham,' pp 563–4). The copy in the Royal
                                Collection at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/38267/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Windsor Castle</rs> (RCIN 1024755) differs substantially
                                from the other three, so Davies has designated it Q2. The
                                differences suggest that most of Q1 was written before the events it
                                describes, and it represents Hertford's plans for the queen's visit,
                                although it does mention the rain on the second day that delayed and
                                altered some of the planned entertainments. Q2 has been more heavily
                                corrected to represent what actually happened, and adds marginal
                                notes to the description of the fourth day that tell us that the
                                queen displayed great patience in enduring more rain in order to
                                witness the pageantry for her departure. Q2 also adds details in a
                                number of places in the text, though it leaves out one extended
                                description of the third day's banquet that appears in Q1 (which can be found here in the endnote). Q2 also
                                includes a more elaborate version of the foldout illustration of the
                                artificial lake setting for the entertainments than the ones
                                included in the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/73473/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Cambridge</rs> and Lambeth copies of Q1.</p><p> The edition
                                of the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/155525/" type="Place_Feature">Elvetham</rs> entertainment included by Nichols had many
                                inaccuracies, as he originally based his text on Q1 and then created
                                a composite version after he encountered Q2, which appears in the
                                1823 edition of Nichols' <title>Progresses</title>. Q2 then
                                disappeared from scholarly view for two centuries, until Davies
                                located it at <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/38787/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Windsor</rs>. In the interim, scholars used Nichols'
                                botched composite, or attempted to sort out what Q2 must have
                                contained by comparing Nichols' version with one or more copies of
                                Q1. Moreover, the illustration of the artificial lake and other
                                set-pieces included by Nichols and frequently reproduced in theatre
                                histories was not in fact the original foldout woodcut, but an
                                eighteenth-century engraving that adds a conjectural lower section
                                to the Q2 illustration (for a fuller analysis of earlier editions of
                                the Elvetham entertainment, see Davies, 'Queen's Entertainment at
                                Elvetham,' pp 562–95.) The edition included here takes Q2 as its
                                copy text throughout, both because it has been corrected and because
                                REED's emphasis is on what was performed, rather than what was
                                originally written. Variant readings in Q1 are given in the textual
                                notes; accidental variants of spelling, punctuation, and typography
                                have been ignored.<lb/></p></note>

                            or fading. The terminal year is definitely 'x' followed by partly faded
                            letter that could be a 'v,' and then fairly clearly a 'j.' This would
                            make it 15–16 Richard II, and it has been identified as from that

                            of accounts is on the cover – a paper one probably of nineteenth-century
                            provenance, which gives the date '1579.' None of the entertainers
                            mentioned in this set of steward's accounts appear in the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1140/" type="Collective_Office">mayor's</rs>
                            accounts for 1578–9, while the mayor's accounts for 1579–80 contain no
                            rewards to itinerant entertainers, suggesting that it was the steward
                            who did the rewarding in that year. The responsibility for recording
                            rewards to visiting performers seems to shift back and forth between the
                            mayor and steward in the late sixteenth century, as such payments are
                            found in the accounts of both but almost never in the same year. Where
                            rewards to entertainers do appear in both the mayor's and steward's
                            accounts, as they do in the 1534–5 accounts, the amounts paid to
                            particular groups match up across the two sets of accounts. These
                            entries have thus been dated to 1579–80 here, following Burch

                            in the First Book of Debts. The first twenty-four leaves contain an
                            alphabetical index of debts. Annual audit accounts begin at f 84 and run
                            to f 241, covering the years 1603 to 1617. The accounts of the auditors
                            cover the whole range of the city's finances, including those recorded
                            in the stewards' accounts and in the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/1140/" type="Collective_Office">mayors'</rs> accounts. The accounting
                            year runs from Michaelmas to Michaelmas. For the years 1603 to 1615
                            items of both receipt and expense are each entered twice, once as
                            credits and once as debits, with folio numbers and marginal reference
                            numbers making cross-referencing easy. Many items are entered in great
                            detail – such as rents, scavage receipts, fees and expenses for town
                            officials, loans, and loan payments. Others, however, are not entered in
                            nearly the same detail as in the stewards' and mayors' accounts, notably
                            gifts and rewards, as well as the costs of construction and repairs.

                            town took responsibility, and apprenticing them was seen as a

                            would have left college in about 1630, aged 18, he was killed by

                            original college register (Thomas Frederick Kirby, <title>Winchester
                                Scholars: A List of the Wardens, Fellows, and Scholars of Saint Mary
                                College of Winchester, near Winchester, commonly called Winchester
                                College</title> (London and Winchester, 1888), 170). According to
                            the college archivist, a note next to the 1623 Longland entry says
                            'gladio interrumpt' et in claust' sepult',' but there is no date given
                            for his death.</ab><ab type="edDesc">The authorship of this poem is unclear. All the
                            handwriting in the manuscript, with the exception of the last page,
                            appears to be the same, and the manuscript includes at least one poem
                            attributed to Donne. Others are by Carew, Cleveland, and Beaumont and
                            Fletcher. There are several others signed 'H' and 'HH,' which could be
                            by the writer himself, who appears to have some connection with <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/39267/" type="Place_BoroughParish">Oxford</rs>,
                            either with Brasenose College or Christ Church but not with New College,
                            as might be expected if there had been any personal connection with
                            Winchester College. The manuscript is undated but Hudson gives the dates
                            as between 1615 and 1640, although the last entry appears to be dated
                            1637 ('Schoolboy Tragedy,' pp 153–4). The poems are copied down at
                            random, not in any date order of the events to which they refer. 'On Dr
                            Dun's Death,' for example, comes earlier in the manuscript than the poem
                            attributed to Donne himself. The poem was written by someone who
                            considered himself a friend and who knew what part Longland took in the
                            performance, so he could well have been a Winchester scholar. Longland
                            did not live long enough to matriculate at Oxford, although his friend
                            may well have done so and have been at New College. Hudson also says
                            that a number of the pieces in the manuscript deal with Winchester
                            College as well as with Oxford, but there is no mention of Winchester at
                            all in the text of this commonplace book.<lb/></ab>

                            then a formulaic entry such as 'ad prandium/cenam cum socijs' or 'cum

                            There are datings of regnal years on the covers, sometimes the year the
                            book was started and sometimes when it ended. Sometimes there are two
                            entries in different hands; the lengthier one in Latin appears to be
                            contemporary and the other brief one is in a later hand. Each week
                            starts with a Saturday and is not dated but designated by a heading such
                            as '2nd week, 2nd quarter' and then by the days in Latin. These have
                            been given specific dates with reference to H. Chitty, bursar from the
                            1910s to 30s, who went to considerable lengths to verify the dates and
                            also to establish dates where no cover has survived, through reference
                            to the corresponding account rolls where they exist or else to lists of
                            scholars/fellows and their dates of admission. The accounting period is
                            usually Michaelmas to Michaelmas and the new year begins with the
                            Saturday following Michaelmas (with one or two exceptions). The quarters
                            are divided into thirteen weeks each, although the fourth quarter
                            sometimes contains a fourteenth week to make the first quarter of the

                            his brethren and initially recorded in the Proceedings Books. The first

                            (W/E6/1), on f [66v], dated 5 September 1591, there are two references
                            to orders agreed 'in the booke of reme<ex>m</ex>braunce.' Since most
                            payments from the city coffers were authorized by orders recorded in the
                            Proceedings Books and no Books of Remembrance are listed in the HRO
                            catalogue, it has been necessary to undertake a lengthy investigation to
                            discover what and where these Books of Remembrance might be. Alderman
                            Jacob on p 4 of Top Win 3/2 (one of his scrapbooks of press cuttings)
                            refers to 'Old records <gap reason="omitted"/> Coffer, sessional and
                            Remembrance.' Further, in an article on Elizabethan trade, 'A Glimpse at
                            Trade in Winton in Queen Elizabeth's Reign,' <title>Hampshire Notes and
                                Queries</title> 4 (1889), 40–1, he quotes from 'a curious book: "The
                            remembrance of thinges agreed in the <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/157414/" type="Place_Feature">Council House</rs>"' (p 40). From the
                            records he quotes it has been possible to trace this book to what the
                            HRO catalogue calls 'Proceedings Book A' (W/B2/2), which was rebound in
                            the early part of the twentieth century and has the title on its cover,
                            'Proceedings of the Corporation.' From this evidence it was established

                            title must have been lost at the time of rebinding. The city archivist
                            has now amended the HRO catalogue description to reflect these findings,
                            although the books will not be renamed because of the number of
                            references to them in printed sources.</ab><ab type="edDesc">The modern binding wrongly

                                Winchester</title> (London, 1963), 91). The fact that Thorpe was
                            re-elected mayor in 1623 suggests that his fellows on the council did
                            not think him the demon that <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/196883/" type="Person_Commoner">Coleman</rs> did. Coleman's complaint accuses
                            Thorpe of a number of abuses while mayor, among them refusing Coleman

                            of Coleman. The charge given the most space is that several men were
                            brought before Thorpe as justice of the town court, accused of running
                            tippling houses without licences, and that Thorpe not only <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/173156/" type="CrimesMisdemeanors">did not
                            punish them but gave them licences to continue</rs>. Coleman adds that these

                            collect fines from other offenders, fines that should have gone to
                            Coleman and others, letting the offenders go unpunished, as in the case
