                <p>Records of Early English Drama (REED) is an international scholarly project that
                    is establishing for the first time the context from which the drama of
                    Shakespeare and his contemporaries grew. Founded in 1976, REED has worked since
                    then to locate, transcribe, and edit historical documents containing evidence of
                    drama, secular music, and other communal entertainment and ceremony from the
                    Middle Ages until 1642, when the Puritans closed the London theatres.</p>

                            beginning in 1519, which are in the same hand as entries for the years
                            1611 onwards, so they presumably were copied by the town clerk or his
                            scribe; (b) accounts of bailiffs, chamberlains, churchwardens, and
                            schoolwardens, because the accounts of the minor officials were
                            presented and approved by the corporation officials before being entered
                            into the town book. In the transcriptions, the entries from the
                            churchwardens are differentiated from the bailiffs' (later the mayors')
                            accounts because they originated from different authorities. The
                            churchwardens' accounting year was 21 December–20 December, with the
                            accounts presented to the bailiffs between 13 February and 19 March, the
                            Friday following Quadragesima Sunday. The bailiffs' accounting year was
                            18 October–17 October, with the accounts similarly being presented
                            between 13 February and 19 March. The mayoral accounting year was later
                            adjusted slightly to begin the next Monday after St Luke's Day (ie, 27
                            October).</ab>

                            including orders for payments, letters, and many other types of official
                            records concerning the running of the vast duchy of Lancaster. Some of
                            the orders are addressed to borough and other local officials within the
                            duchy, and deal with local arrangements. Two such excerpts deal with
                            Newcastle under Lyme and Tutbury, and hence the register books are fully
                            described above, under those boroughs. The register books also contain a
                            vast amount of material about the running of Gaunt's various households
                            in England, as far-flung as Bamburgh, Leicester, Kenilworth, Kingston
                            Lacy, Hertford, and the Savoy, as well as others in Europe. Records of
                            his payments for minstrels and other entertainers have been transcribed,
                            wherever activities or payments for them may have occurred, because the
                            administrative centres of the duchy appear to have been Tutbury and
                            Kenilworth. The register books have been published as <title>John of

                            [a/b] and [c/d], the two variant versions of the orders. It is assumed
                            that [a], the version of the orders which cannot be precisely dated, is
                            earlier because it is a re-issue (with minor changes, errors, and
                            omissions) of the orders of 1618 (TNA: DL 41/587). Presumably the letter
                            of 7 May 1630, [b], was intended to accompany this version of the
                            orders. It could not have been intended for the orders dated later, the
                            revised orders of 10 May 1630 (1631?), item [c]. These revised orders
                            presumably reflect changes ordered by the new chancellor of the duchy of
                            Lancaster, Edward Barrett, Lord Newburgh, who held office from April
                            1629 concurrently with his predecessor, Sir <rs

                            May's death in June 1630 likely caused some upheaval in the workings of
                            the Chancery office, and may account for the confusion in dates with
                            this version of the orders. In any case there appears to have been a
                            delay of a little over a year before the revised orders, item [c], were
                            issued, along with item [d], Newburgh's letter of 21 May 1631 ordering
                            that the orders be exemplified and enforced. However, the existence of
                            an exemplification dated 10 May 1630 (1631?) may indicate that
                            Newburgh's letter was related to yet another recension of the orders,
                            now lost. The relationships between these variant versions, one
                            concludes, are not at all clear.</ab>

                            in Staffordshire Record Office for consultation by arrangement. It
                            contains annual churchwardens' accounts, presented usually at Lady Day
                            or Mid-Lent Sunday each year; in most cases the date of presentation
                            specifies the calendar year. This is assumed to have been in Old Style
                            and the year has been corrected accordingly (for example, 1520 has been
                            given as 1520/1). There are several cases in which both the calendar and
                            regnal year are specified; in these the year appears to be given in New
                            Style and has not been corrected. The handwriting, presumably that of
                            the parish clerk, changes several times in the course of the years
