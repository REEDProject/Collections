                <p>Records of Early English Drama (REED) is an international scholarly project that
                    is establishing for the first time the context from which the drama of
                    Shakespeare and his contemporaries grew. Founded in 1976, REED has worked since
                    then to locate, transcribe, and edit historical documents containing evidence of
                    drama, secular music, and other communal entertainment and ceremony from the
                    Middle Ages until 1642, when the Puritans closed the London theatres.</p>

                            beginning in 1519, which are in the same hand as entries for the years
                            1611 onwards, so they presumably were copied by the town clerk or his
                            scribe; (b) accounts of bailiffs, chamberlains, churchwardens, and
                            schoolwardens, because the accounts of the minor officials were
                            presented and approved by the corporation officials before being entered
                            into the town book. In the transcriptions, the entries from the
                            churchwardens are differentiated from the bailiffs' (later the mayors')
                            accounts because they originated from different authorities. The
                            churchwardens' accounting year was 21 December–20 December, with the
                            accounts presented to the bailiffs between 13 February and 19 March, the
                            Friday following Quadragesima Sunday. The bailiffs' accounting year was
                            18 October–17 October, with the accounts similarly being presented
                            between 13 February and 19 March. The mayoral accounting year was later
                            adjusted slightly to begin the next Monday after St Luke's Day (ie, 27
                            October).</ab>

                            including orders for payments, letters, and many other types of official
                            records concerning the running of the vast duchy of Lancaster. Some of
                            the orders are addressed to borough and other local officials within the
                            duchy, and deal with local arrangements. Two such excerpts deal with
                            Newcastle under Lyme and Tutbury, and hence the register books are fully
                            described above, under those boroughs. The register books also contain a
                            vast amount of material about the running of Gaunt's various households
                            in England, as far-flung as Bamburgh, Leicester, Kenilworth, Kingston
                            Lacy, Hertford, and the Savoy, as well as others in Europe. Records of
                            his payments for minstrels and other entertainers have been transcribed,
                            wherever activities or payments for them may have occurred, because the
                            administrative centres of the duchy appear to have been Tutbury and
                            Kenilworth. The register books have been published as <title>John of

                            [a/b] and [c/d], the two variant versions of the orders. It is assumed
                            that [a], the version of the orders which cannot be precisely dated, is
                            earlier because it is a re-issue (with minor changes, errors, and
                            omissions) of the orders of 1618 (TNA: DL 41/587). Presumably the letter
                            of 7 May 1630, [b], was intended to accompany this version of the
                            orders. It could not have been intended for the orders dated later, the
                            revised orders of 10 May 1630 (1631?), item [c]. These revised orders
                            presumably reflect changes ordered by the new chancellor of the duchy of
                            Lancaster, Edward Barrett, Lord Newburgh, who held office from April
                            1629 concurrently with his predecessor, Sir <rs

                            May's death in June 1630 likely caused some upheaval in the workings of
                            the Chancery office, and may account for the confusion in dates with
                            this version of the orders. In any case there appears to have been a
                            delay of a little over a year before the revised orders, item [c], were
                            issued, along with item [d], Newburgh's letter of 21 May 1631 ordering
                            that the orders be exemplified and enforced. However, the existence of
                            an exemplification dated 10 May 1630 (1631?) may indicate that
                            Newburgh's letter was related to yet another recension of the orders,
                            now lost. The relationships between these variant versions, one
                            concludes, are not at all clear.</ab>

                            in Staffordshire Record Office for consultation by arrangement. It
                            contains annual churchwardens' accounts, presented usually at Lady Day
                            or Mid-Lent Sunday each year; in most cases the date of presentation
                            specifies the calendar year. This is assumed to have been in Old Style
                            and the year has been corrected accordingly (for example, 1520 has been
                            given as 1520/1). There are several cases in which both the calendar and
                            regnal year are specified; in these the year appears to be given in New
                            Style and has not been corrected. The handwriting, presumably that of
                            the parish clerk, changes several times in the course of the years

                            its present form, of a series of preserved and mounted fragmentary
                            leaves and bifolia, some numbered in modern pencil, others not. The

                                a fire in 1897. What remains are two antiquarian transcriptions from

                                results from the HMC survey of the MSS before the house burned,

                                by William Macray for the Historical Manuscript Commission in 1888
                                ('Corporation of Reading,' pp 167–227). Fourteen rolls before 1413
                                seen by Macray are no longer extant. Those for 1363–4, 1366–7,
                                1367–8, 1378–9, and 1384–5 were used by Norman Gibbs in his Oxford
                                doctoral thesis in 1935. All had disappeared by 1960 (Slade,
                                    <title>Reading Gild Accounts</title>, pt 1, pp xvii–xxii). There
                                has been speculation that the disappearance was as a result of enemy
                                action during the Second World War when Reading, by then an
                                important railway centre, was heavily bombed. Macray does not record the accounting year, but later MS evidence indicates that it was Michaelmas to Michaaelmas.  </p></note>

                            Easter. The first three accounts run from Good Friday to Good Friday.
                            Good Friday in 1521 fell on March 29, only four days after the fixed
                            feast of the Annunciation (Lady Day), March 25. The <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/3576/" type="Collective_ClergyAndChurchwardens">churchwardens</rs> took
                            advantage of this small discrepancy and, despite the fact that the
                            heading for the 1520–1 accounts specifies that the account would run
                            until Good Friday 1521, the account for 1521–2 clearly states that it
                            begins March 25. Dating from March 25 became the custom of the parish
                            from that year. <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/73312/" type="Place_BoroughParish">St Giles</rs> was a parish that followed the custom of
                            wardens serving staggered two year terms. It is likely that the warden
                            who served both these years, <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/58486/" type="Person_Commoner">Richard Hayne</rs>, was instrumental in making
                            the change.<lb/> This volume is very fragile and was consulted only by
                            special permission. The transcriptions were made from a microfilm copy.
                            The first four folios are taken up with rents suggesting that the parish
                            had considerable property holdings. The accounts indicate a full
                            liturgical life with processions on <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/42968/" type="CalendarDay_Liturgical">Ascension Day</rs> and <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/41497/" type="CalendarDay_Liturgical">Corpus Christi</rs>
                            with streamers and the ringing of bells. The patronal <rs ref="http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/eats/entity/76292/" type="CalendarDay_Liturgical">feast day for St
                            Giles</rs> was also celebrated with a procession with banners. The bells were
                            rung when royalty passed through.</ab>

                            work but then was lost. At the beginning of research for this

                            then rector of the parish church in Windsor, undertook a search for the

                            BRO.<lb/> The dating in these accounts is uncertain. The churchwardens
                            often served for two or three years and their accounting was done at the
